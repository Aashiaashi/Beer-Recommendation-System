    "The two beers with the closest evaluation scores are Tucher Festbier and Curiosity One Hundred Twenty Six. Two similarities between the two beers is their golden color and hoppiness. Curiosity One Hundred Twenty Six is brewed using entirely concentrated hop products. Similarly, Tucher Festbier is brewed as a lager with a louder presence of hops. The strong hoppy presence in both beers led to a high similarity and sentiment score between the two beers. "

    "### How would your recommendation change if you use word vectors (e.g., the spaCy package with medium sized pretrained word vectors) instead of the plain vanilla bag-of-words cosine similarity? One way to analyze the difference would be to consider the % of reviews that mention a preferred attribute. E.g., if you recommend a product, what % of its reviews mention an attribute specified by the customer? Do you see any difference across bag-of-words and word vector approaches?"

    "The beer I chose was the Mornin' Delight. Using the above lift scores for the top four attributes, the most closely related beer is Blessed. The beers are very close with their overall lift scores and have simalr scores on the four attributes. For their carbonation Mornin' Delight has a lift of ~0.36 and Blessed has a score of ~0.56. These are both on the lower side of lift scores compared to the other beers listed above, thus are lightly carbonated beers. As for their sweetness, the two beers are closely related and are on the sweeter side (not as sweet as Vanilla Bean Assassin). I used the lift values to help me determine their relationship and judge what type of beer these two are. From the data and lift scores we can predict the two are lighter sweet beers, very opposite from the heavy Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout. To get a stronger understanding of the beers, it is better to look at the indiviudal lift scores for each attriubte rather than the overall lift score. "
