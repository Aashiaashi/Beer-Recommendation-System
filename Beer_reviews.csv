Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"I didnt think i was going to give it a perfect score but..... Its looks, smells, tastes, a 5, HOWEVER, the mouth feel is NOT BY ANY MEANS EQUAL TO LOOK SMELL AND TASTE. Pardon me i have to sit down. Mouth feel is, well 11. Yeh, like twice as good as anything ive ever had before. It grabs you by the face with both hands and says, 'what was that that just went down my throat'. It tasted familiar-- like real, pure butter on real Belgium-chocolate, buttermilk pancakes with fresh highbush blueberries, real Vermont maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, served with Seattle coffee, and a shot of pappy.",5.0
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!”
Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?
So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too.
The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care.
After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful.
Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant.
Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…",3.75
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2021 vintage, bottle #79

Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?

Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing

The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon

Man, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness

I won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one. More than the sum of its parts. Cheers BA!",4.75
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Celebrating my buddy @Rug with his 1,000th beer review. Pours an almost perfect black with no head. Smells lightly of maple syrup and chocolate. With the first sip I immediately tasted chocolate and caramel followed by a maple syrup finish. The syrup flavor lingers. The feel department is where this stout lacks. Feels very light, which is good for me as someone not too fond of stouts and lagers but to the avid fan of a heavier beer, this one may disappoint. Overall great beer and I’m glad I got to crack it open with my bud.",4.25
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Thick and syrupy pour, mocha head. Aroma is boozy maple, bittersweet chocolate.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Initial nose is beautiful maple! The taste is nice barrel, maple, coffee and chocolate. This is very rich and overall deserving of the high ratings. The only slight knock on this beer is viscosity.",5.0
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"A: Nightfall in appearance that presents a class, of shades, within the Bearded Iris: Before the Storm. Though, the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani, with dyed allocations on provoked (methodical) discharges. Inasmuch as, light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck, given the dark purple to aerated grey-green exhales. In conjunction, a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation. Yet, justifiably well-designed, as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip. There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold, as that portrayal comes in balmy, goaded strides. Notwithstanding, the thermal development behind tack-distilled tears, for adequately webbing church windows. To that extent, a multi-layered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission

S: Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweet/rich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple, as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension. Thereby, ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee, while puck tamping a quad-sized shot in back. There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans. Coupled with, an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems, while strolling cold deciduous forests, as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin. The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath, while malt soothes midriffs above, before synergizing cask complexions. Accordingly, a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipane/hazelnut praline, while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves. The furtherance becomes rightly victimized, by the prolonged exposure, where opportunities pit meaty leather to spice-pipe tobacco, as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut. This progresses to sawn wood, from the recoiled temperate woodlands, as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes. In the interim, an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt, as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind (soft) tannins

T: A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains, as esters serenely interweave. The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins, while summersaulting around prunes, before paying heed to Lemberger grapes. That aside, foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes, as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades. Mid-palate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nuts/walnuts, in the act of a polymer coalescence. Chiefly, a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains, as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials. In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions

M: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness. Such factors roadmap a weighing scale, as vitrics breath open air, and course a drying constitute. In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques

O: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods. In centering agenda, the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth, yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time. Consequently, forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded, by a tug-of-war sense of heft, but consciously linger with a palate fondness in step",4.25

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,Lots of maple and coffee notes. Mild barrel presence.,4.5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Draft pour at TG.

Pitch black with no head. Not too thick. At the nose is heavy maple with some coffee. I didn’t really pick up any barrels though. The taste is likewise the same, heavy maple with coffee and chocolate. Very little barrel as it warmed. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation. Not too thin nor too thick. Overall: a standard BA breakfast stout. Great beer overall but over hyped with ridiculous pricing. Glad I had a draft pour which cost less per oz than the bottle. It seems to me it’s almost the same as Mornin Delight.",4.5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2020 vintage drank 10/22/21
Incredible smell as soon as bottle was opened. Rich maple, chocolate, syrup breakfast in a glass. Incredibly smooth. Not a ton of bourbon flavor, and no alcohol burn. Not as thick as some TG stouts like assassin, but still an incredible beer and glad I chased it. Definitely one of the best",4.75

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Long time waiting to tick this one, and I have to say - pretty underwhelmed. Its delicious as far as maple syrup goes, but overall it was lacking in complexity. Barrel was light and not much else. Nice mouth feel and long finish.",4.5
Vanilla Bean Assassin,"Bottle, graciously shared by Clark at Peg’s. Dark brown pour with a light brown head. Inviting vanilla bean and coco puff aromas. Sweet with delicious vanilla, rich caramel, decadent chocolate, and woody notes. Some heat from the whiskey, but not overwhelming. More of a backbeat really. Doesn’t drink like a 12%er. Smooth, but complex with a very good mouthfeel and body. Bravo......",4.75
Vanilla Bean Assassin,"Unofficially my last beer of the top 250 (had the trade secured for it before changes were made to calculations, making me 20 short again...)

It glugs out of the bottle super thick and tar black. It has a finger and a half head of tight, thick khaki bubbles that recedes slowly to a thin film and collar that retain throughout. Leaves some nice legs on the glass when swirled.

Immediate strong aromas of boozy bourbon are softened by sweet vanilla and lightly toasted marshmallow. Fudgey brownie batter, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toasted coconut, and charred oak all follow. There's just a hint of figs linger in the background.

The flavor is quite bourbon forward, but very round and smooth. It's like a scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream topped with burnt caramel, artisan fudge, and a shot of high end bourbon. Nothing pops much except maybe the bourbon, but this is quite well balanced.

The mouth feel is thick, but not overly so. It's slick and coats the mouth well, lingering and begging you to take another sip. Just the right amount (only a touch) of carbonation, and a bone dry, slightly boozy finish. Superb!

Overall this is an absolute pleasure of a beer to drink, and a worthy one for my ""last"" of the 250 list! It doesn't blow me away in the flavor department, but it does in its balance and roundedness! Those are things hard to find in modern BA adjunct stouts! The fact that I could EASILY solo dome this bottle says something!",4.75
Vanilla Bean Assassin,"As far as vanilla barrel ages stouts go, it is hard to name a better one than this. Very sweet, but just short of cloying. The huge fudge notes blend perfectly with that intense vanilla marshmallow presence. Don't miss out on this one if you have a chance to get some!",5.0

Marshmallow Handjee,"Midnight black with a dark mocha head. No real retention or lacing.

Chocolate, vanilla and plum stand out most in the nose. I really enjoy the fruitiness behind what is some very strong brownie batter and vanilla.

The taste is pretty similar. Loads of vanilla without it seeming artificial. High quality brownie. Fruit complexity underneath. And lots of heat.

Oily slick feel with soft fizz.

Probably overhyped, but still very nicely done. The flavors are all intense without being over intense.",4.25
Marshmallow Handjee,"Just because it can't be perfect, I guess, but it's damn close.

L:I was looking for Marshmallow Handjee. Looked for awhile. Looks cool in the bottle and better in my wine glass.
S: Mmmmm - did I see it can't be perfect? The nose on this gem is as close as it gets. Before the characteristic Dark Lord depth, there is the vanilla-creamy-sweet-smores thing going. And that's just the easy part. The complex, fine barrel notes compete with the earthy black malts and I love every moment of the struggle. If oil came from barley, this would fuel jets.
T: No surprises because the smell telegraphs the taste like an amateur against Ali. More of the vanilla sweet cocoa gram up front followed by the bourbon twisted chocolate caramel espresso of a great stout. It's all here.
F: It's like chewing bubble gum that never gets boring nor loses its flavor. Heavy like the punch that aforementioned amateur caught on the jaw though. Sloooww sipper.
Overall this is how it's done. An adjunct stout is never my first choice but, when done right, you get something like this. I don't like it better than the straight up WWS or some of the other simple, three ingredient brews, but it is damn good.",4.75
Marshmallow Handjee,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Heavy oily legs form on the glass after a swirl. Aroma is marshmallow and brown sugary initially. This overt sugariness breaks away to reveal roasty and toasty malts with a hearty bitter edge. Underneath is bourbon and late barrel character, which further counteract the initial sugary notes. Flavor profile pushes the same start - marshmallow and brown sugar, in addition to toffee. As these start-up notes fade, hearty barrel, bourbon, and roasty and toasty malts are revealed. The latter hearty notes becomes the storyline the second half, countering the initial sugary notes well. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, smooth, and full texture. Overall, while the sugary start leads to a dangerous territory, the following malt and barrel notes balance the whole experience out well.

Served from a 750mL bottle. Light blue wax. Allowed to warm ~45 minutes at room temperature after removal from the fridge. Reviewed from notes.",4.5
Marshmallow Handjee,"Been hunting a long time for this one and finally landed a 2019 bottle.
Remarkable how little this tastes like a regular Darklord. It's fairly sweet which i generally don't like, but the barrel presence compensates enough to make it really enjoyable. It delivers on all fronts with ton's of vanilla, chocolate notes and some heat from the barrel. It's also nice and thiccc.",5.0

Marshmallow Handjee,"Brewing pastry stouts before pastry stouts were cool, the imperial stout that Dark Lord used to be has trended sweeter, more sultry, heavier and stronger as time has passes. Now doubling down with a vanilla-riddled, bourbon barrel aged version of that notorious elixir has allowed time to finally catch up with it.

With a thick, oily and onyx looking pour, Marshmallow Hanjee shares barely a trickle of froth before falling still. As its decadent scent of vanilla drifts gently above its sweet and savory roast, the scent of espresso, cocoa and nuttiness permeates an oxidized aroma of sherry, port and soy. Devilishly sweet, the beer's early cloying nature saturates the early palate with molasses, sorghum, vanilla cream and all-things burnt marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, sweet wines and savory sherry, port and madeira. Hinting toward soy sauce, a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut, caramel, toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip.

Heavy, rich and undeniably cloying, the sipping ale is oily and warm on the palate, reserved as an after dinner digestif. A long, rich and fat maltiness clings to the mouth for an impossibly long and spicy aftertaste.",4.5

Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,Exceptional beer. Like a christmas pudding with a hint of chilli and bourbon.,4.5
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"This is a beer I've been wanting to try for some time now (was able to obtain it in a trade for Fremont B5K).

The beer pours fairly dark, blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer certainly looks impressive enough. On the nose, I pick up vanilla, green chili peppers, some chocolate, underlying coffee and considerable whiskey. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though I thought it a bit hot on the finish (something that is especially noticeable, given the chili flavor in this beer). That being said, the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat, and really doesn't seem to blend in all that well. It does add another flavor component/dimension, which is always nice, but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesn't seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise, and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile. Drinkability is pretty good, though it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting.

This is a very nice beer, but given it's reputation, I confess I was expecting a bit more from it. Very glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this probably isn't a beer I'd want to seek out again.",4.25

Smell- Nice chocolate and caramel mix with a hint of cinnamon. The barrel was present but not as strong as I expected.
Taste- Mostly followed the smell except the bourbon added a nice little kick to each sip. The molasses taste seemed more toward the middle of the pour.
Mouthfeel- Smooth with no carbonation. Not as thick and had nice lacing.
Overall- A first class stout with a great finish.",5.0
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Appearance - The poured a thick black color with a dark tan head. The body could block out the sun.

Smell - The nose radiated chocolate with the spice of a cinnamon cookie.

Taste - Initially, the beer was like boozy chocolate. The cinnamon brought to mind spicy cinnamon cookies with ancho heat. Notes of raisin juice and dark fruits follow. It was a bit warming toward the back with a lingering spice.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a huge smooth body with little carbonation.

Overall - The beer may not have been exactly as I expected, but it was quite nice.",4.5
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Pours very dark black with a thin tan head on top, Smells of Cinnamon Toast Crunch soaked in Bourbon which I think is pretty nice. The taste of the beer has the cinnamon and the touch of spice in there along with the vanilla and chocolate. The feel is nice and silky, doesn't burn the throat or mouth from the adjuncts which is perfect. Overall it's an outstanding beer and was fortunate to try it finally.",4.5
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Big time grail for me. Vintage 2019 on tap at Bier Station, consumed and reviewed October 2021.

Pours black with a finger and a half of dark caramel foam. Good head retention. Aroma is spices, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts offer up a firm base, adding a strong malty stout backbone to each whiff. As the sweetness crescendos to a peak, barrel character sweeps in to add some char, bourbon, and bitterness. Alcohol remains an after thought, allowing the beer to shine forward of its ABV. Loaded from first whiff to last sniff. Flavor profile is more of the same - a firm stout base of roasty and toasty malts form the foundation of cinnamon, spices, vanilla, caramel, molasses, toffee, and cream. It opens up less spicy than the nose, but finishes more spicy than the nose, that is to say, the dynamics are shaped in contrast - mirrored. Only caveat to the mirror image is the barrel character notes of char and bourbon that come thru at the end again, dropping this stout an octave into deeper heartiness. Despite the bourbon character popping through the beer, the beer never comes off as hot. Mouth feel is thick with a smooth, consistent grit. Its feel is uniform from front to back. Overall, incredible depth with loads of barrel complimenting the initial spices well. It borders on an ADHD stout, spreading it's attention in a spiderweb of directions, but remains cohesive enough to form an intoxicating melody.

Heady Topper,Pours a hazy gold. Thick foam. Juicy sweet hop aroma. Loads of dank hop flavors. Some sweetness. Some bitterness. Loads of juicy goodness. Not for the beginner but definitely very drinkable and a must have if you love IPAs.,4.75
Heady Topper,"Canned 8/18/22. Purchased that day at the brewery.

L: Normally kept in the can, this one pours a hazy dark orange with a big head that quickly thins to a film with splotches on the cap and a thicker ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal but attractive.

S: Huge aromas of everything good. Floral, citrus, tropical, mixed berries, and pine. Incredible.

T: Strong hop character in your face up front. Mellows a bit in the middle to reveal some delicious juicy fruit and berries, but the hops never take a back seat. Finishes dry, but not as bitter as the hop punch would suggest.

F: The hop onslaught provides a sticky, resinous mouthfeel, which is not a criticism.

O: Heady Topper takes no prisoners. An absolute hop smackdown that also showcases a wide variety of aromas and flavors. This is the DIPA for those who think west coasts are too bitter and hazies are too juicy.",4.75
Heady Topper,"I opened a pint can, bright citrus (mostly pineapple), pine and herbal hops greeted the nose. Bready malt and citrus juice give the impression of sweetness, alcohol is noticeable. I drank out of the can for a few sips, bitter, semi-dry and boldly flavored. Hops are way out in front, juiciness masks the malt flavor. Bitterness rises throughout the taste.

Next, I poured most of the rest into a mug. Pale orange-straw body, very hazy with a rich creamy white head that quickly shrunk to a cap that lasted leaving rings of lacing. The taste is best this way and represents a well-made Imperial New England style IPA.

Next, I added in the dregs, and I can see why this is not recommended. The haze changed to cloudy and turbid, the taste changed to peppery bitter with a slight funky juiciness. I don't mind the dregs; the white pepper bitterness hides the alcohol and keeps the sweet juice taste in check.

Medium bodied with plentiful carbonation, bold, bitter and still balanced but I wouldn't call it smooth. Lightly colored for the style and begs the question ""Should there be an Imperial NEIPA category?""
Following of the pouring guidelines is highly recommended.

Heady Topper,"My second favorite beer of all time. Absolutely nothing but awesome deliciousness throughout. Unfortunately I live in Wisconsin, and have to pay my brother to send me 4 packs. I love the somewhat malty hopped taste, when you open a can it’s aroma is almost as good as the taste. It’s been around for years, yet with all the new brews coming and going, it has rarely met it’s match.",4.75
Heady Topper,"I’m not understanding the hype around this one. My buddy from MA sent me a four pack for my birthday so I have been dissecting this for a week now.

Pours a wonderful, slightly hazy dark straw color with an immaculate head.

Aroma seems a bit lacking. Sure it has hops but it isn’t overwhelming or any better than the other 100 IPAs out there. Kind of citrusy with a touch of pine.

It’s a little malty for my liking. Thick and heavy. The hop oils really coat the tongue. Bitterness is average, not too much.

It’s a good beer but not world class IMO.",4.0
Heady Topper,"We were in Rhode Island when I first had this beer.
Hope I can find it in other places.
Very smooth IPA.",5.0
Heady Topper,"Look: Yeah, I know, I poured it out into a glass – old habits die hard. Light orange and cloudy with a silky-looking pure white head that builds up and holds as a lid, ever-so-slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Ripe peaches, mango, tangerines, strawberries, cantaloupe melon, pine, some kiwi, kumquats, Cannabis, blueberries, and some sweet malt
Taste: Opens up with a barrage of citrus fruits and resinous pine sap that seemingly gain strength as they develop. Peaches, mango, and mixed berries pop up both together and separate as the journey continues and dankness also makes it presence known here and there in no-so-subtle ways. Malt sweetness tries to keep up but is continually beaten back by the hops and closes with a conifer-laden finish and a delectable, strong bite
Mouthfeel: Full, a little slick, medium-high carbonation, and felt and I’d say medium-strength dryness on the finish
Overall: Wow, this is outstanding. To me, this was the OG I heard about, here on BA, before the NE-Style IPA trend migrated West and when I saw a month-old can, I had to try it as I haven’t been a fan of the sub-style much since it took over here but figured and wished I would be. Happy to say, this is my type of beer though as it absolutely captures the amazing aromatics that the late/dry hop additions and yeast can being to the ‘hazy’ style but it drinks like a WCIPA without the chewy feel and an awesome, pithy bite, and plenty of dryness. Color me WAY impressed and I’d buy this again and again in a heartbeat. Thank you, The Alchemist, for creating this gem and props on blowing me away right out of the gate, as that doesn’t happen often",4.75
Heady Topper,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $5.25. No canned on date. This must be fresh because this doesn't get distributed here very often and it usually sells out pretty quickly.

Look: Pours a mildly to moderately hazy pale yellow/golden color. The head dissipated quickly. This is very pale for an 8% ABV Double IPA.

Smell: The aroma is very expressive. Tons of dank, resinous hops. A bit of citrus thrown in too. Up front, I get a strong green bell pepper note. This yields to citrusy notes and resinous, piney hoppiness. I get notes of grapefruit and lemon hard candy, along with secondary notes of papaya and mango.

Taste: This is really good. It is actually quite drinkable given how aggressive it is. Up front, it's citrusy and dank. The finish is tooth-enamel stripping bitterness, in a good way. It has a strong bitter finish with lots of woody pine tar, grapefruit pith, and lemon rind. The finish is very dry and the bitterness lingers long.

Feel: It has a slick and oily mouthfeel with a relatively soft carbonation. Medium bodied.

Overall: This is my first time trying Heady Topper, as well as my first time trying anything from Alchemist. There is so much hype around this beer, so it was almost impossible to live up to it. But it actually manages to come pretty close. What I find most interesting about this beer is that it is so different from ""New England-Style IPAs"" that are made by 90% of breweries today. To me, this beer is more West Coast at heart than it is an NEIPA. This beer reminds me of Lagunitas Super Cluster, which I know is all-Citra hopped and I do not know which hops are used in Heady Topper. I would think that there at least has got to be Citra in here too though. Also reminds me a bit of Foley Brothers Prospect.",4.25
Heady Topper,The only truly hoppy beer I have ever liked. I do not like IPAs or hoppy beers in general and headytopper is unbelievably good,4.75

Heady Topper,"Very difficult beer to find in my area. Luckily, there was what appears to be a one time drop at my local store - very limited amount. I scoffed two 4 packs. This is definitely a solid brew, but I don't find it all that drinkable. I was never able to drink more than one before wanting to move on to something else. Pretty one-dimensional to me - bitter, bitter, and bitter. I prefer a more balanced, multifaceted IPA.

If I come across some I will probably purchase a 4 pack, but it's not something I will be actively seeking out, there are plenty of other beers that I prefer over this one.",3.5
Heady Topper,"Alchemist Heady Topper Imperial IPA, 8% ABV. Can is dated 05/09/22. Pours...wait, didn't pour it, per the label. Nose is a forest of big f'ing pine trees. Taste follows, and though hugely bitter, still quite drinkable. Excellent mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Overall world-class. I've got sap in my beard and I'm belching pine trees.",4.5
Heady Topper,"Maybe it's because it has been hyped, maybe it's because I drank it in a glass rather than from the can (as suggested on the can), but I was underwhelmed by this most hyped of IPAs...

It does look pretty good, has a very piney smell that just doesn't resonate with me, and the taste is full of that same resin that comes from pine. I suppose there are many that swear by it, but this just isn't what I was expecting from a ""world class"" beer. Mouthfeel was smooth, I do have to give it that, actually very smooth. Out of respect and acknowledgement I did give it an overall higher rating than I normally would, but in the end I'm walking away feeling, well...meh...",4.0
Heady Topper,The quintessential IPA - nice hop bite but tempered bitterness. Just an outstanding first step into piney goodness with a citrus backbone.,4.5
Heady Topper,"I've been fortunate enough to have this multiple times and each time I'm impressed. Looks the part of a fantasticly crafted IPA. Pale yellow color with a nice murkiness. Smell is off the charts when fresh and bursting with pine and citrus. Just like the nose there is lots of pine and orange zest, but never overly bitter. Dangerously drinkable even though its a bit hefty in the body. I've had multiple in a night before and though the morning after was a touch rough, I didn't regret a single sip. Overall, this beer is worth every bit of praise it receives in my opinion.",5.0
Heady Topper,"Finally found the Holy Grail in Colorado. Unexpectedly pine-forward. I am sick of all those juice NEIPAs out there. This is a NEIPA style with pine, The perfect IPA. I bought 20 of these, and they'll be gone by the end of Memorial Day.",5.0
Heady Topper,"Dave Dave Erazo vacationed in New England and brought my son and me some Alchemist brews. Fresh Heady Topper at refrigerator temperature poured from the can (!) into glasses. Slightly cloudy pale yellow body with a pure white cotton candy head. Aroma is powerfully hoppy, sort of reminiscent of the pungent Ballantine ale from Newark in 1971. Very good beer. It's hop flavor and aroma are accompanied by a lasting flavorful bitter aftertaste. For myself , I could use a bit more malt body, possibly with a little less alcohol. But this is a memorable modern IPA, probably the best one I've tasted.",4.25
Heady Topper,Best NEIPA I have had. Super drinkable and all around delicious. A light sweetness to the malts balances with a hearty hop bitterness and makes it more refreshing and easier to drink than I expected. Great beer.,4.75
Heady Topper,a little over a month old. tried some from the can but i preferred drinking from a glass to get a good whiff of the hops while taking a drink. It is slightly foggy with a good head and lacing. Nice citrus smell. citrus follows to the taste with pine balancing it out. i had my doubts but it lived up to the hype.,5.0

Blessed,"Batch 2, 2022

Oh man, here we are. The highest rated beer from Alaska, and 8th highest rated overall on BA. Getting Anchorage beers is always a treat, but I’m expecting this one to go beyond a treat. Let’s pop this bad boy open

Pours a very dark muddy brown with a finger of reddish dark brown head that immediately fades to nothing and leaves no lacing but decent sheeting

To call the nose decadent would be a massive understatement, I could smell this one from the second I cracked it and the aroma filled the room. I’m picking up on aromas of sticky caramel, thick fudge, toasted coconut, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, dates, light roast coffee, nougat, and a touch of maple

While it is certainly good in taste, it doesn't quite reach the levels of the aroma, though there's still a lot going on. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate cake, black cherry, sweet coconut, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, and a touch of fudge. The swallow brings notes of chocolate cake, toasted coconut, creamy vanilla, sweet bourbon, fresh oak, fruity coffee, dates, and burnt caramel

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich and slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky with a touch of boozy heat but nothing overbearing

This is truly an awesome beer. I'm sure many will complain that batch 1 was better or some stupid shit like that, but having had only this one, it's amazing. What a treat, cheers BA!",4.5
Blessed,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours jet black with insanely dark brown head. The head disappeared within seconds, leaving an array of very small coconut chunks floating on top. Looks fantastic.

The nose is absolutely insane. Thick layers of vanilla, coconut, bourbon, chocolate, toffee, marshmallow, a touch of maple, figs, and more sweet fudge. This is definitely on the sweet side, but it just smells thick and creamy.

The taste is marvelous. In addition to the vanilla, fudge, coconut, and bourbon, some of the roasted malts from the base stouts comes through. Marshmallow and some dark fruit. The coconut is definitely on the toasted side, at least that is what comes through. Some burnt toffee, a touch of coffee grounds, and some oak bitterness on the back end. Overall, this hits all the senses and makes for a great ride. Not overly sweet on the taste.

Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Long aftertaste. Overall, a fantastic BA stout.",4.5
Blessed,"Dark, inky body, opaque; carbonation burbles percolate above a flat crown with no head. Very rich, powerful aroma; fudge and milk chocolate; roasted and charred grain; moderate sweetness. Very sweet and spicy taste; cocoa and milk chocolate; vanilla and cinnamon; coconut; raisins and figs; fairly bold alcohol presence simmering beneath the sweetness. Heavy body; slick and chewy; very rich residual sugar feel; some alcohol warmth noted, increasing as the beer warms.

This beer exudes decadence and richness. The overall sweetness is a bit overpowering. I think the alcohol notes are more from the beer's ABV rather than anything from the barrel aging. The lack of any head is also a minus. Still, taste-wise, and overlooking the dominating sweetness, this isn't a bad imperial stout, just lacking some depth and complexity that it really could have it had a bit more balance between the malts, coconut, vanilla, and barrel-aging used in its creation.

Mornin' Delight,"2022 Variant - bottle split 4 ways - pours a a rich black with a nice mocha foam into a tulip. Overpowering maple on the nose, and was a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me, and too much of a dessert stout, but the taste was so well balanced - maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and baker's chocolate flavor.

While MD was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective, this was not a cheap bottle to get to Pittsburgh haha - overall - well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given it's more readily available, it's still a world class pour. Glad I have a bottle left.",4.75
Mornin' Delight,"2021 bottle split 3 ways, was fortunate enough to win this in a charity raffle and wasted no time enjoying it

Look - an aggressive pour into a tulip glass looking like oil with a nice two finger mocha colored head

Smell - the maple, oh the maple! While it dominates, also get some notes of vanilla, toffee and chocolate

Taste - The maple sweetness definitely hits at first bit there is a good balance with some roasty coffee and semi-sweet chocolate flavors. Outstanding

Mouthfeel - it's thick, syrupy and coats the mouth nicely

Overall - just an absolute world class beer, my only wish is I would've had some waffles or French toast for brunch to pair with it",4.75

Smell: Heavy caramel, butterscotch, maple syrup, chocolate cake, vanilla. Definitely the best smelling stout to ever grace my nose. Amazing.

Mornin' Delight,"2021 vintage, growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck

Serious question, does Half Time ever disappoint? Any time I’m heading to New York I make a point to stop in there, and I always find good stuff that I can’t really find elsewhere. In addition to 2015 vintage 120 Minute IPA, they had this for fills. A successful trip there yet again. I’ve wanted to try this one for a while, currently sitting at #7 of the highest rated beers of all time on BA. I’m very excited to try this, so let’s crack it open

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

It’s not even a question that this is loaded with maple in the nose, but it feels very authentic. I’m picking up on aromas of maple candy, medium roast coffee, sweet caramel, nougat, milk chocolate, raisin, and vanilla creme

In taste, it has an interesting vibe where it’s even more sweet, but also quite balanced in its sweetness. More or less sweetness from different notes working together well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, marshmallow, sticky maple, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple candy, sticky caramel, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toffee, and candied raisin

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a super slick beer. Finishes very sticky with a bit of boozy heat

This is good no doubt, great even, but it is very sweet. Because of this, I can’t give it reslly anywhere near the average. A good beer, but there’s better options for this kind of thing",4.5

I am blown away that anyone could complain about the $15 pour. Most of NYC just had a mediocre pinot noir for $15 and found that normal. This may be the very best pour value in the city. Go in before it’s gone.

The rich and luscious cocoa-colored foam pours two fingers deep over a nearly black base, and slowly dissolves leaving ample lacing coating the surface and the rim of the glass. Powerfully aromatic maple and coffee is detectable a foot away. Bringing the nose in closer reveals underlying notes of chocolate and an intense maple and coffee that is simply about as pleasing as can be expected from a beer. The taste is fresh maple and coffee, chocolate, molasses and syrup with just a hint of roasted malts and hops from the base beer. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall just short of life changing, but if every coffee stout were this good it would be a better world.",4.5

Near-flawless brew.",4.75
King Julius,"With utmost radiance, vibrancy and brilliance in its hop display, Tree House's Imperial New England IPA hits hops pinnacle. In a world of princes, they are the king.

And the excellence in King Julius is not only expected but also realized with a creamy peachy-taupe and golden hue with airy textures in its creamy meringue-like froth. The beer's muddled appearance only works to make the session more appetizing. A slow separation of froth ale underneath suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy-sweet and fruit-filled taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and sprucy scent starts out like a fruitier citronella.

The flavors that simply blossom on the middle palate are abundant with a bursting fruit display. Branch-ripe tangerine,in all its tangy, fructose-sweet and vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple, pawpaw and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting finish, a sense of herbal sherbet with citronella apply their final and lasting impressions of spiked fruit punch.

Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts plush on the palate but trails into a semi-dry, smoothly bittered, softly resinous and tea-like finish. The soft sappiness of fresh and perfumy cedar links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative minty cooling and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with gin-spiked sorbet textures as well as flavors.",4.75
King Julius,"16oz. Can served in a Spiegelau tulip. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a frothy, half-inch, off-white head. Nose expresses bright notes of Mandarin Orange and peel.

King Julius,"Canned 8/19/22. Warm yellow orange color, totally opaque hazy beer. An inch of just off-white head on top which hangs around a good bit, and laces the glass well. Nose is as advertised, orange cream, mango, honeydew melon, ripe and sweet and a bit floral at the end. There are so many good NEIPAs out there that I often think they start to run together... then I taste something like this. Sweet at the very beginning, but also floral, big citrus notes, grapefruit and orange peel, with a silky feel. What's incredible is how clean it finishes for what really starts out pretty sweet, but the grassy and a little bitter orange hop resin at the end leave your mouth not overly sweet at the end. The booze is present, but it plays in the background. The bitterness shines through especially at the end in a really satisfying ""take another sip"" type of way.",4.75
King Julius,"Canned: Jul-29-2022

""The Crimson King's balcony beer"", indeed.

Wow. It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation. Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian white-collar prison in heaven. That or an Orange Julius from hell. Either way, only the best.

Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy. It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything off-putting in the flavor. Lovely look to it. Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine, clementine, apricots, grapefruit rind dipped in honey, pithy citrus oil, weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel, I could go on. Again, wow....

Like with most of the IIPAs from TH, this is as close to perfect as you can get. A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique, each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others. Textbook example of what the style can be.

One other thing I want to add here for no real reason. I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years. These are the first of their beers I've had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible (at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec). A month old and just mellowed right into itself. No vague hints of oxidation, no fading or changing profile over the few cans I've had of this (and others ranging up to a month and a half old). Anyway, cheers to the canning line. Based on their many date code messages I've seen over the years and including this one I think we'd all enjoy sitting around listening to music together. You guys rock!

Cheers, KC!

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

King JJJuliusss,"Canned on 8/9/22; consumed on 9/9/22

Pours an opaque, rusted dark orange body capped with two fingers of creamy, off-white foam; decent head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, moderate, frothy collar, amd layers of chunky, webby lacing encircling the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fresh orange juice sit atop a fluffy malt foundation, soon welcoming peach, passionfruit, and grapefruit peel as undertones of catty dank poke through over time and musty lime eases through the closing impressions.

Taste offers candied grapefruit and sugar-dusted orange as a passionfruit zest meets musty lime to balance a level, tropical citrus overlay, while subtler undertones of fresh peach/mango linger on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-full body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a weighty fluff of glossy resins through the mid-palate; a creamy counterbalance to a largely subdued grit on the back end eases to a soft hop twang and minimal perceptible bitterness through the finish.

Sweet fruit saturation sports detailed edges of earthier dank, and while heavy on the palate, maintains a steady, balanced presentation of ripe, juicy resins throughout.",4.0

T: Taste is immediately wildly complex. There’s a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch, then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever.

Review 1200!!! For this landmark review, I'm tackling the highest rated Traditional Lambic on BA, which also happens to be the 10th highest rated beer overall on the site. This one has been a huge want for me for quite some time now, so I'm happy I managed to source a bottle. I will drink half of this immediately and decant the other half for about 20 minutes, as suggest by 3F and others who have reviewed to see the difference. I will take the highest of the 2 for the official rating, but I'm sure that will be the decanted version. Let's pop it open

Pours a cloudy deep orange with just a thin ring of bubbles which obviously leaves no lacing. Expected for the style, and I don't think decanting will make a difference in this regard

The first whiff of this tells me that decanting is probably the move, as it feels like it needs to open up a bit first. Pre-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of peat smoke, leather, oxidized sherry, wet hay, and white wine vinegar. Post-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, tart peach, white peppercorn, oxidized sherry, wet hay, wheat cracker, toasted oak, light smoke, and stone

The same applies for taste, this is super funky and almost aggressive pre-decant. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, olorosso sherry, sharp oak, leather, sweet honey and light smoke. The swallow brings notes of peat smoke, wet hay, old leather, vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, and apple skin. Post-decant, it really opens up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, pear skin, oxidized sherry, toasted oak, earthy wheat, wet hay, and a touch of peat smoke. The swallow brings notes of oxidized sherry, peat smoke, wet hay, lemon zest, tart peach, wheat bread, stone, light leather and sharp oak

Much like the appearance, I don't think decanting will have any effect on the mouthfeel. A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and funky beer. Finishes bone dry with a hefty funk. This is so damn refreshing that I could literally chug it, but obviously I wouldn't do that

Wow, this is truly awesome stuff. I mean, I can't say I'm surprised, I knew what I was getting into, but it was an absolute honor. Paired wonderfully with a smoked bleu cheese and fig pecan crackers. I couldn't think of a better beer for 1200. Cheers BA!",4.5
Zenne Y Frontera,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass.

Pours a beautiful gold color with a light haziness to the transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam. Aroma is sherry and barrel right off the cusp. Funky stone, lemon, and earthy notes round it out with a light funky nose. Sherry smooths things out, elevating the whole nose from base, while delivering stronger, more potent notes of dried fruit. Flavor profile builds on the nose, hitting sherry and barrel character first. Stone, lemon, tangy green apple, and earthy notes round it out - again. There is a sublime twist of funky tartness that does well to give the whole flavor profile an additional dimension. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Texture is driven by a consistent, smooth, even texture. Overall, just a splendid beer, in each terms of complexity, quaffability, and thoughtfulness. Lovely.

Blend no 94. Season 18|19. Bottling date of 25/07/19. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes. My first pour of a Zenne y Frontera.",4.75
Zenne Y Frontera,Bottle: Poured a dark golden color lambic with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of funky ester with some barnyard notes and some woody vinous notes. Taste is also a mix of vinous notes with some funky barnyard notes and oak notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Great lambic but was expecting the Pedro Ximinez barrel to be more apparent.,4.25
Zenne Y Frontera,Bottle. Generously shared by Seth. Clear light amber pour with a small white head. Mild funk aromas. Mellow caramel and oak notes give way to mellow horse blanket and barnyard backbeats. Smooth with less prickly champaign like carbonation. Very good mouthfeel and body. Simply outstanding.,4.75
Zenne Y Frontera,"Bottle @ La Palma Sour Fest 2015. Hazy orange colored beer with a small white head. Holy smokes is this funky. Tons of musty, damp, earthy basement and mushroom notes. Bright lemon and green grape acidity. Slight apricot sweetness and perhaps a hint of vanilla. Really nice mineral quality to it as well. Pretty citrusy and zesty as well. A winner, as usual.",4.5

Pliny The Younger,"Pours a slight dark gold with a light frost to the transparency. Head is a couple fingers of plush white foam.

Aroma is a pleasant quick hit of tropical fruits, citrus, and mild resin and grass. It melds together sugary hop notes seamlessly with sticky hops for a dramatic, dynamic, quick-hitting aroma. Light bready malts adorn the back of the aroma profile, but are faint in comparison to the hops. Hops are never loud, instead, they land at a mild volume of ""six"" on a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest. Instead of using volume, hops are overlapped to create complexity.

Flavor profile is light tropical fruits and citrus at the onset, sharing the spotlight with resiny, grassy, piney, and mild herbal and floral hops, before dipping back into tropical fruits at the finish. Pine notes build in intensity as the beer warms, but it refrains from crossing into overly sticky or heavy. It's never overtly sweet, nor does it carry a bitter bite at the end, as do some west coast IPAs. Instead, the end is marked by a light dryness that marks an end to hops. That dryness is accompanied by bready malts.

Mouth feel is medium-thick with a consistent, crisp texture driven by a mild effervescence. It's just thick enough to drink more like an experience, and less like a parking lot, tailgating IPA - though I would never turn down a pour / bottle of this in the latter situation.

Overall, this beer embodies wonderful balance, along with thoughtful nuance, to create a dreamy smooth IPA. Hops are pleasant, plump, and forward, without carrying the pedal-to-the-metal force of some other IPAs. This one is marked and adorned by simplicity and nuance.

Pliny The Younger,"On draft on March 25th and bottle today. In the past four trips up over a decade, Pliny would always have an unmistakable distinguished character to it. It was the Cadillac of Russian River. This time I called the server over. ""Are you sure this is it? Not Happy Hops or something else?"". Nope. This was Younger. More acidic and lacking the smooth richness and piney, sticky aftertaste, and gone was the once amazing nose of sap and sweet burnt sugar. With three to try on this visit, I had just one pour, and was, like my friend, stumped and disappointed. The vibe of visiting Windsor was pleasant, I took a self guided tour, the wait in the spring sunshine a mere three and a half hours, and the food there scrumptious. My friend and I shared a bottle of Refraction, a collab with Brooklyn Brewery, and that seemed to have more to offer. Still, I purchased two bottles of PtY to go to give it another shot at home. Pouring it now in a four ounce glass akin to what they served it in at Santa Rosa, I have the same vibes from it. I got a four pack of R&D #4 from the gift shop and enjoyed those more. Alas!",3.0
Pliny The Younger,"Appearance - The beer poured a clear golden color with visible carbonation and a white head.

Smell - The earthy pine notes were strong in the nose. By way of comparison, it smelled like in the amped up version of Elder.

Taste - Having sampled Pliny the elder first, I will use it as a means of comparison. Younger seemed like an amped up version of Elder. The green grass and hops was next level. The pine notes left a little room for sweetness, but there was somewhat of a backbone. The pain notes lingered in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer had the body of an imperial, with carbonation scrubbing away the sweetness and allowing the bitterness to linger.

Ever since finding craft beer through Sam Adams in the early college days of the mid-2000s, this has been the ultimate Sasquatch beer.

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"2021 batch.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells very strongly of coconut, with loads of milk and dark chocolate, very slight roast, light bourbon, and lots of creamy vanilla.

This is definitely sweet, but honestly, not as sweet as I expected. This really does meet the hype that it garners - it's exactly what you want out of high quality pastry. The coconut is done so well, it's so bright and vibrant and just plain tasty. There's a little bit of barrel, it helps anchor the beer slightly. The vanilla is also done very well, and it's all just layered on top of a very tasty and creamy base beer.

This is very creamy and rich, with no real booziness to it at all. It's very, very drinkable.

I almost didn't want this one to be good - I don't always like Angry Chair and this is such a hyped beer. Fortunately (unfortunately?) for me, it's honestly awesome. This is the best Angry Chair beer that I've ever had.",4.75

Smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes. Taste is the best chocolate I’ve ever tasted in a stout. Rich, sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste. Mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue. This beer blew me away! I’ve had the non BA Version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own.

T: Citrus up front, followed by peach and strawberry. Finishes dry and slightly bitter with some dankness. Very little heat for the ABV.

F: A bit pricklier mouthfeel than is normal for Tree House. Medium carbonation.

""Long days and pleasant nights"" on the date code

Lovely look as per usual. Glowing gold, hazy, ok covering of creamy white head that leaves swooping lacing. The aroma is dank and earthy compared to what I was expecting, with some stonefruit and clementine sweetness underneath. Perhaps a tiny bit faded, but I might be having an off day. Delicious and enticing regardless. The flavor is (as expected) a barrage of peaches, citrus (sweet not tart or bitter) and weedy hop funk. There is definitely more to it but on the whole it is a balance between peachy sweetness, canteloup, clementine and the more resinous (but not sappy) character of the hops. Mouthfeel is spot on as usual, creamy, round and filling while also refreshing. Really nice beer. I think it was Haze that I once described as a sweaty hippie taking a nap in the shade after a day of harvesting peaches. Well in this case the hippie is also burning one and we are smelling his feet after stomping up some overripe peaches to make wine. Or something like that I have no idea...

Very Hazy,With my good friends Mark & Marcia.,4.0
Very Hazy,"really cool to get to drink this, so thankful i have people in my life who want to share this kind of thing with me, but i am just shocked that this comes in at number 15 on the BA top beers list, like in the entire world, seems outlandish for something i would not even describe as insanely well refined or anything, and yeah the hop profile is great, but it also has some burn, some unneeded weight, feels under carbonated to me, and really doesnt distinguish itself as elite in any way. that might sound harsh, if this was from my local watering hole i would be pretty stoked, but to get all in a tizzy about it is simply foolish, which is not true of all the tree house hyped hazy ones by the way, but is true about this one. super dense looking from the 12 ounce can, high frothy white headed and all, but dull a little bit and chewy, not as maybe well refined as expected or as very green was pretty much right next to it. i wish they told you the hops, but then i guess everyone would copycat it, but it seems somewhat conventional, like citra could be driving it along with something just slightly spicy at this dosage, a bit of bitterness which i dont hate, short of green burn, a fine line in this style and they walk it, but i am perhaps seeking a little more. it warms up favorably before the alcohol takes over, i get green pear, orange tic tac candy, and a little white grape, its tasty, even downright awesome, and i like the way it kind of permeates the tongue and hangs after each swallow, its semi permanent on the palate. not oily or slick feeling through, truly a new england type to its core. minimal grain flavor but all the body in the world, nobody would call this balance, and i dont need it to be, but it seems big for the sake of it, like the hops dont even want this much structure, and not that its forced, but just that its not perfect, as the ratings seem to suggest. i like their yeast and its used well here, its a little short on bubbles for a big one, at least for my preferences, and overall the flavor cannot be denied, this is yummy, but is it objectively amazing beer leagues better than the rest in this space? heck no. one of the more anticipated but least epic tree house beers ive cut into, which is still to say its still excellent, but it certainly has a peer group...",4.25

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,Batch 3,4.75
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,I expected a little more. But it was still pretty tasty!,4.5
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"A: The emergence is dense on lucidity with a materialization that ensues oily margins. Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above

S: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length

T: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin

M: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms

O: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks. An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout; albeit, an advantageous/more beneficial buildout, if given the patience to draw out time",4.25

Fundamental Observation,"I had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage. This review is for the 2019 vintage. The 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory), although I think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker.

Surprisingly, at 3 years this beer hasn't lost much (any?) vanilla, although refrigerated most of that time.

The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell. The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else. Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract. The taste is similar, but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for. It's the essence, but not direct flavor. Lots of deep, fudgy chocolate. A bit of alcohol on the back end, which is unusual, but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla. While tasty, I wouldn't say that the taste is complex.

Nothing exceptional about this beer, but it is very good. I think that my score accurately reflects how I feel about this beer and what I think it is deserving of.",4.25
Fundamental Observation,"Sampling a cellar temp bottle poured into my snifter. Received in part of my winnings for NFL BIF 33. This is a 2019 vintage with 13.55% ABV

First sip is lighter body than I expected and smooth slightly creamy texture. Carbonation is soft and gentle and rolls easily across my palate. Easy drinking for a big boozy beer.
Flavor is sweet fudge and chocolate with hints of toffee and brown sugar. I also get bourbon and some vanilla and black peppery spicy heat on the finish. Again hops dont show up anywhere in this brew.

Fundamental Observation,"Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. This is the 2019 edition, so a little age on it. Sorry, it's all I could find! The bottle has 2 check boxes though, one for ""drink fresh"" and one for ""cellar and save"" and the latter is checked. So I'm at least following the rules.

A: Pours super dark and thick, motor-oil like. Nice lacing up the glass. Minimal off-white head that fades quickly.

S: Huge vanilla up front. It's like extract, maybe vanilla coffee creamer. Super on the nose, with a little bourbon note behind it.

T: Again, vanilla is the centerpiece. It's a real sweet vanilla note here, I know it's not extract, but it's so concentrated and strong. Bourbon there on the finish, really a second player to the vanilla.

M: This is where this beer really excels. Nice, full mouthfeel. Very balanced. The vanilla is huge, but so is the bourbon. Feels like everything is in HD. Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers I've had.

O: Okay, well. This is very good. I'll start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all. I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list, but it was so out of reach, I didn't think much of it. Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some '19 bottles left. Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS, which I can totally see. I haven't had that beer in some time, so this isn't a 1:1. But I'll say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good, if not better. My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more. But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better. This is really strong and vanilla forward, and it's a really sweet and pastry-like vanilla. Not that I want it subdued in any way, but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more natural-tasting. I really feel like I'm splitting hairs here. At the end of the day, it's huge props to BL for making a really good, chewy, balanced, BA stout. Oh, and I think the age may have even helped this beer. I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor. Again, the vanilla is huge on this.

Recommendation: I think this beer deserves its ranking and reputation. Must try for any BA stout fan.",4.75
Fundamental Observation,"The beers pours the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and fair at best head retention. This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging (though it's not overly viscous). On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla, with underlying bourbon and light licorice. It's nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, but with a much greater level of intensity. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, moderately sweet finish. Carbonation seemed to be on the low side, which I tend to think works well with rich, BA impy stouts (like this one). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit. Even so, there's no way I would guess an abv. in the 14% range.

This is a very nice BA impy stout, no doubt, though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd go out of my way to find. Still a very solid beer...",4.5

Looks lethal and the nose goes as deep as you want it to. I could sniff this all day; there’s dark rye bread, beef jerky, baker’s chocolate…
That flavor, though. It tastes like a pastry - fig, vanilla, caramel, flaky shell - that doesn’t actually exist. But then it’s also cake! Steph sez: “It’s like they crashed a full bakery into the bottle.”
4-way mud wrestling match between all the vanilla (both bean + barrel, yet without any booze from the latter), sugar, dark fruit, and roasty notes. Everyone takes a turn without taking over.
It’s a perfect example of barrel aging, it’s savoury, it’s dessert - walks a razor’s edge. How is it so cakey without being that sweet? How does it tame the sweet without being charred or boozy? Not hot, ashy, cloying, sugary… the execution is just baffling + masterful.

Fundamental Observation,"Pours pitch black, completely opaque and shiny. It appears thick and viscous. Thin, weakish, velvety mocha colored head fleetingly appears on the beer.

The aroma has notes of vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, caramelized brown sugar, brownie batter, oak, and some light smoke and dark fruit notes. The vanilla however is the show here - its absolutely dominated by the vanilla and its lovely.

Taste follows the nose with notes of roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla, sweet cream, bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, chocolate and yea, vanilla. If you like your vanilla stout to avoid subtly this is perfect. Its sweet, but dances up to the cloying line without going over. The barrel aging is nicely balanced. There is a light smokiness that I occasionally get, but I suspect that is the influence of the bourbon.

Fundamental Observation,"2018 bottle Poured cold, hard to a tulip. Jet black, no floaters. No head at all…starts to bubble for a ring, then peters out. Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage. As it warms, that might change. I can see why people search this out. Excellent brew!",5.0

Look: Black color fairly minimal brown/tan head. Minimum-moderate carbonation.
Smell: light bourbon, light vanilla, chocolate, wood.
Taste: vanilla, oak, chocolate, molasses, bourbon, maybe very slight oxidation.
Feel: medium-thin, smooth, very slight bourbon burn. “Booziness” well-hidden.
Overall: well incorporated vanilla stout with 3+ years on it. I heard the recent vintage was “not the same” so wanted to try one first that had a good reputation.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"2022

Drinking this is comparable to drinking cold brew coffee concentrate that I forgot to water down. The intensity of flavors makes this absolutely unique. The relatively short time in the barrels seems to leave the oaky depths and nuance behind in favor of a massive straight up bourbon presence. This works well with the strong toffee and raisin base. This does not represent my favorite approach to double barrel barleywine, I will continue to buy multiples of everything Kane offers at a fraction of the price while this is a one and done purchase. But, these are flavors I enjoy at intensity levels that no one else offers. If you are curious, I say try this once. This is leaps and bounds better than Wendigo.",4.75

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Born 25 July, 2017. 12.9% ABV.
Top popped (53 degrees) with a whimpering sigh, got a nice coffee aroma right away. Almost zero head at all made for a full pour into my 12oz Avery Brewing snifter.
Bourbon and espresso coffee share the nose space.
The first taste matches the nose. Chewing on it a little reveals notes of fine cacao, bit of vanilla, faint oak barrel, a dark fruit I can’t quite put a finger on and a welcoming heat.

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2014 Vintage

Appearance: Black with a small, dark, beige head that quickly faded. Age probably took a big hit on the head size.

Smell: Fairly prominent bourbon aromas and moderate coffee aromas. Not bad, but again age is a factor here as well as the appearance.

Taste: Bourbon notes, prominent coffee notes, mild brown sugar notes, and mild tannic oak notes. The coffee comes off a touch bitter but considering the age of the beer it's not bad and provides a nice counter to the bourbon notes.

Mouth-feel: Mediuml-bodied with a fairly low level of carbonation. Not a bad mouthfeel but age is a factor.

Overall: While the beer wasn't bad, I get the feeling I'm only getting a glimpse of how good the beer was fresh. hopefully it's rebrewed and I can get my hands on a fresh one.",4.0
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Goose Island – Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout (BCBCS – 2014)

12.6% ABV

The beer is listed as “Stout – American Imperial” on BA.

The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 years. Beer poured into 2012 BCBS snifter.

First Impression: Pours dark, thinner than BCBS. 4.5

Appearance: Standard Bourbon County. An aggressive pour years only a small amount of khaki head that fades quickly, leaving only a small ring around the glass. 4.25

Smell: Coffee up front. Mostly this cold-brew smelling with a hint of grounds and also the dread ‘pepper’. Weak barrel on the nose. 4.25

Taste: 2014 and earlier BCBCS is what all coffee stouts should be judged on for me. As the kids say, ‘it fucks’. And after this many years, to still say that? Come on. Taste starts with the coffee, shifts to bourbon, pulls in some chocolate fudge brownies, shifts back to bourbon, finishes on coffee, and then a slow finish lasts for longer than most BA stouts, let alone BA coffee stouts. Impressive for 12.5% abv. 4.70

Mouthfeel: Coffee stouts are always thinner than their regular counterparts. They just are. While this is clearly thinner than the regular, not appreciably so. For judging this against other coffee stouts, this is still upper echelon. 4.75

Overall: This is a great beer, and I’m jamming on this. I debated about whether to have this tonight, because I have to get up in 4.5 hours to hit the BCBS release. Well, I’m glad I did, but only because I chose to drink this tonight. It’s really fantastic. It’s incredible how well this has held up. I did have this a few years back (just once), and while it was great, I don’t remember enjoying it quite this much. This is just singing tonight. It’s everything that I want. And the finish just keeps going. I’m in heaven. All this said – could it be better? Of course. I’d love to have even more barrel. I’d love to see how this shined at 15%. But for what it is, and compared to others, this is Heaven. 4.65

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Bottled 7/25/17, cracking this open just over 4 years later

Oh boy, we have quite the whale here. From what I've heard, the coffee BCBS is one of the most sought after variants, and 2017 is unfortunately the last vintage. I never really expected to see it on a shelf anywhere. However, when visiting DC this past weekend, I decided to pop in a liquor store to search for some of the Dogfish Head spirits, since we don't get those up here in Mass. Well, I found their whiskey and was happy, but decided to check out the beer selection. This one was staring at me and I immediately snatched it without looking at the price tag. Worth it? Let's find out

Pours a velvety black with a finger of dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but very strong legs

This is wonderfully balanced between roasty and sweet in the nose, like a decadent coffee drink mixed to perfection. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy caramel, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla creme, ripe fig, smooth oak, and just the slightest hint of sweet blueberry

The fact that this has such a strong coffee presence after 4 years is very impressive. Many of these beers tend to fall off in flavor pretty quick, but it is beautifully preserved here, despite not being full force. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting creamy vanilla, lightly spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, medium acidic coffee, and light grape. The swallow brings notes of decadent milk chocolate, oily espresso beans, burnt toast, a touch of that vegetal green pepper character others have complained about in older bottles, and earthy oaked bourbon on the aftertaste

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and viscous beer. Finishes mostly dry from the bourbon heat

This beer is awesome! It doesn't quite crack my top 10 though I suspect it might if fresher. Regardless, I'm very happy to have tried this one, and here's to hoping they bring it back next year!",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,My favorite coffee beer,5.0
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2017 Vintage

L: Deep black with a slight twinge of brown

A: The winner in my opinion. Bakers chocolate and coffee all the way.

T: Do not drink this beer cold, severely underwhelming. Once it warms there is a strong chocolate syrupy goodness up front followed by a slight sweetened Cuban coffee. While I assume the coffee has dropped off some, still provides a strong aftertaste which makes it more enjoyable.

M: It’s bourbon county. Always proper almost syrup like.

O: While a damn good beer, I think the hype train has won with the coffee BCBS. I have not had a lot of them, but I prefer the regular. Maybe I’m in the minority here. Still great though.",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2014 vintage poured into a pint glass.

Appearance: Pours impenetrable dark brown with no head at all, leaving a slight sediment behind in the bottle.

Smell: Very rich coffee and bourbon, a bit of chocolate. No green pepper.

Taste: Phenomenally smooth and deep. Starts with bourbon, shifts to dark, acidic coffee grinds, finishes with a delightful burnt bread roast. My only demerit is that I find the bourbon ever so slightly too dominant on some finishes.

Feel: Full-bodied but not too heavy, with light carbonation. Bit of alcohol on the finish, but not too much.

Overall: It's a huge beer, really well put-together. It's a bourbon-lover's coffee stout, with a very prominent bourbon character that somehow still doesn't mask the big coffee base.",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2013 Vintage - Los Inmortales Coffee

335ml bottle - lightly chilled, poured into a snifter.

Appearance: Pours a coal-black hue - slightly thin, with a deep reddish-mahogany ring around the top edge. Zero head, zero foam, zero collar. Just sits like liquorice-coloured liquid in the glass. Lifeless.

Nose: Surpriseingly, the coffee is still here - and quite strong. The coffee is deep, dark, roasty and pungent, with an almost stale quality to it - like a gas station coffee maker that hasn't been emptied or cleaned in a day. It almost smells sticky and concentrated, very much like Kaluha. Zero green pepper. There's some deep roast beneath the coffee, along with a bit of an ashen/smoky note. Some tangy dark fruit peeks through, as well as some bourbon, and if you really dig deep, some vanilla, oak, and baker's chocolate emerge. Not much warmth. Coffee dominates.

Palate: This 7 year old stout greets the palate fairly sweet, with some rich chocolate fudge, brownie batter, vanilla, bourbon, and oak, before an intense coffee presence explodes and takes the lead. It's a miracle there's still so much coffee in here. The coffee is sweet, black, roasty, with some fresh whole bean notes. Saturated, almost like coffee liqueur, and then finally showing some of that stale back coffee character. A whisper of tangy dark fruit pokes out, before some coffee bean bitterness begins to show, quickly compounded by blackened malt bitterness, drying this out very quickly and fully. Some more subtle bourbon, followed by some less subtle barrel reappear, and the finish approaches, bringing sticky black coffee, roasty beans, bitter malt roast, pure cacao, charred malt, and spicy charred oak. No lingering sweetness.

Mouthfeel/Body: Admittedly, I expected this to be thin, given its age, but surprisingly, it's actually packing some nice heft when chilled. It isn't luscious or chewy, but before it warms, it does have some nice viscosity, though it does thin out as it warms. Effervescence is extremely low - not still, and there is some subtle fuzz in there, but like a cup of soda the morning after you poured it. Quite sticky around the lips, but almost fully dries out in the finish with all that roast.

Overall: This is a difficult one to rate. Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that I've never had? It may actually not be. I'll never know how this was when fresh, but even now, I'd say this is a perfectly respectable barrel-aged coffee stout. Strong coffee presence, no green pepper notes, essentially no oxidation, and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee. The bourbon and barrel are subdued, and the effervescence is lacking, but as-is, this is still a great coffee stout. The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the early-mid BCBS era. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout. I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffee-forward, because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans. Certainly not the case here, but I wouldn't hold onto one any longer than this. Gracefully aged.",4.25

Canned: Aug-10-2022

Pours like they all do... Very nice, glowing orange haziness with a creamy cap that sticks around till the end. Aroma and flavor are a complex, layered mixture of tropical and non-tropical fruits and different ""green"" characters just like the OG Green (probably my favorite beer, and definitely my favorite NEIPA) but turned up a bit. This does not drink like a gimmick. Nose is still a little rough around the edges. But is a melange of sticky, resinous fruit. The flavor is grapefruit oleo, underripe guava, green mango, pine sap. It is so wonderfully sappy-yet-sweet and hop layered/laden. It reminds me of the first time I had Heady Topper*. Morning dew in the Rockies at the break of day after a late night around the campfire. Hot dogs. America. Fuck. So good.
Truly loverly.

Very GGGreennn,"Canned on 6/2/22; consumed on 6/17/22

Pours a turbid, mango purée-esque body topped with multiple fingers of rich, fluffy, slightly off-white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of creamy cap, a large, frothy collar, and thin, soapy curtains of webby/spotty lacing draping down the entirety of the walls of the glass.

Aromas of dank peppermint beneath layers of juicy pineapple and mango slices dominant, with dense undertones of bubblegum yeast accented by papaya as a subtle, bready malt welcomes an earthy, catty stank to the back end of the bouquet.

Taste highlights orange contrasted by sweeter peach upfront, progressively dank and overripe into musty passionfruit and guava over the mid-palate as a catty dank proceeds into bready malt easing into mossy undertones on the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body and a moderate carbonation, rounded and fluffy to a peak of creamy overtones and contrasting juicy, boggy resins; a hop twang emerging in the back end guides to a refined, earthy grit marking the finish.

Myriad juicy fruits and boggy hops bring an onslaught of lush, full-flavored character within an overtly resinous containment; supremely, comprehensively expressive, this is an immense display of hop variation from Tree House at its peak.",4.5

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not really sure what this is other than a variation of ""Green"" so I'll leave that up to you to research, I'm just going to drink it! It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of creamy white foam. The aroma expresses passionfruit, soft orange, nectarine, and hop resins. Tasting it reveals a sweetish, basic malt that's bready and must be made up of of 2-row brewers malt as well as wheat and oats although I can't taste the oats specifically. I'm finding passionfruit, pineapple, peach, orange, and lemon/lime as well as more hop resin. There's a lot of hop bite to it, and a decent amout of bitterness although there's also a lot of malt to balance it. Things are becoming clearer to me now - this is a double IPA, and not just a more heavily hopped version of ""Green"". I actually like it better. The additional maltiness softens it and allows the hop flavors to come through more clearly. It seems less bitter, although it's probably got more IBUs. Beyond that, the hop bite is smoothed out. There's additional alcohol but it doesn't stick out any more than you want it to in a double IPA. It's dry in the finish but not as dry as the original, and it's certainly not as seemingly bitter and biting overall. I find it very rounded and smooth, while at the same time still a bit of a hulk of a beer. I'm about halfway through so let me comment on the head retention and lacing, and then the mouthfeel. The head has held up really well and I still have a creamy surface covering. The lacing covers the glass with swirling 'stained glass' and sweeping waves breaking into spots of sea foam. Almost all of the Treehouse beers have great head retention and lacing and this is no exception. In the mouth it's medium-full in body and beautifully smooth and fluffy. I am impressed!

Taste: I don't think it's as citrusy as people are saying, but that isn't to say there is no citrus/tropical fruit. Fruity up front then quickly transfers to a puckering bitter floral/piney taste. Almost reminiscent of a west coast at the end if it wasn't for such a creamy mouthfeel.

Very Green,"pretty cool to have new beer friends in idaho that have access to this stuff, i thought being this far out west now i might never get to try some of these, pretty highly rated stuff here, way up on the top 250 list for one ive never had, so impossibly stoked to get into this along with a couple of their other ones, a rare drinking experience indeed, at least for me. i think we out in this part of the country forget that beer this hazy and dense can also be beautiful, they dont have to all be murky and dull because they are matte, and they dont have to look heavy and sedimented just because they arent clear, this is starchy looking yeah, but its pretty in its solemn bigness, and the creamy dense shaving cream white head sits on top like this is a belgian, others take note! there is also no appreciable change to gloop in the bottom inch of the can, thank heavens! definitely some quality issues out there in the world compared to this one visually, i needed to see this. the aroma and flavor here are on the precipice of being over hopped, green indeed, but not following through with the burn, and not really smelling and tasting like pellets, more like orange juice from concentrate to be honest, pineapple and tangerine juice, mandarin oranges from the can, green grapes in my old school lunch box, white wine too maybe, and just enough earthy grain to keep it beery, surprisingly no harshness even though it walks right up to that line. there is balance here, just a little breadiness from the yeast, and more bitterness than expected, its not all juice, still finishes like ipa. i get some alcohol too, its not over the top, but it definitely drinks like a double with that and all the body, soft carbonation and pillows going down. the flavors of this are excellent but this doesnt hit like something super original in terms of ingredients or processes, i wish they told us what they hops are, but its the execution that sets it apart for me, the quality is epic, so often copied but only on rare occasion equaled. this was a joy to drink and i am thankful for the experience. high end but not radical, if that makes sense. i wish more were refined to this degree, its memorable for that reason. exceptional, but not even in my top handful of hoppy beers these guys make...",4.5

T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.

M: Crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time.",4.75

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The head appears to be holding quite well as is always the case with Treehouse beers. The aroma delivers sweetish and bready malt along with notes of passionfruit, nectarine, some mild hop resin, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of passionfruit, pineapple, orange, citrus pith, and a hint of lemon/lime. The malt is basic and sweetish. It's bready, and oat-like. A very firm bitterness makes it's way through all of the sweet malt (it's got to be more bitter but you just can't tell) but there's also a whole lot of acidic ""hop burn"" and it finishes dry with some passionfruit, soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium but feeling a little fuller because of all the extra proteins from the wheat and oats, and the carbonation and hop acidity gives a gentle bristle on the tongue before becoming smoother. The head has held up really well and it's left some beautiful lace all around the glass. I'm quite pleased with Very Green and feel that it's actually better than Green but that's just my opinion. Regardles, it remains a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Very Green,"16oz can courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ.

Poured into my Precious Things Teku (my one and only Teku), this was an opaque yellow-orange color, with a good sized & creamy looking off-white head. Lots of lace.

Nose is of tropical and citrus fruits. Initially just sweet fruit scent, as it warms a more bitter, pithy aroma seeps into the background.

More complex than the nose lets on, although the beginning is straightforward tropical fruits and Mandarin oranges, Midway through there's a more pithy, bitter happiness. The level of bitterness is just right to add a shade of complexity to things without clashing with what came before. Things finish off smoothly, with a slightly dry bitter zap to the palate.

Medium bodied, with a mouth feel that's a bit creamy.

Really, really dug this. Really regretting only having one can. Thank you so much for this, Bill!",4.25

V.S.O.J.,"Pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.

The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).

The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected. I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait. Truly a world class English barleywine.",4.75
V.S.O.J.,"Pours a dark burgundy that reveals a remarkably clear transparency when held directly against a light. If not held against a light, or if poured in a dark room, the beer looks black. Moderately heavy oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl, foreshadowing a heavy, hearty beer. Head is two and a half fingers of khaki foam.

Aroma is raisins, fig, toffee, molasses, and dark fruits mashed together with leathery, spicy bourbon. Barrel adds additional char and heat, which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel, toasty, and bready malts. That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms.

Flavor profile is fig, raisins, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and hearty dark fruits. Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence, which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note, heavy malt, or bourbon. Bourbon is present throughout, but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile, building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill. Despite that build up, it never runs away with heat. Underneath it all is strong caramel, bready, and toasty malts.

Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence, offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the mid-way point. A very light silt adds some further texture, but really, it's smooth. The texture matches, both, the aging process output, and alcohol, suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol.

Overall, a remarkable beer that pairs bourbon barrel complexity over a resounding barleywine. Regardless of notes, it's a remarkable beer for sipping, offering complexity and depth at every corner and crevice.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. Canned June 29, 2021. 15% ABV.

For kicks, this was served side-by-side with Piggyback 6yr Rye aged in V.S.O.J. barrels. This is a sample from barrel #1. A few notes: Dark coloration, with moderate oily legs after a swirl. Spicy rye on the cusp of the nose, with heavy barrel leading way to floral and mild bourbon and dark fruits behind. Complexity is dense, mixing in a little cake at the finish. Flavor profile brings a more mild profile, building spicy rye over oak, lemon zest, floral and mild dark fruits and bourbon. Spice simmers on the back of the palate long after a sip, emphasizing the rye base. Really smooth, with a crescendo from start to finish that resembles a wheelchair ramp - a linear rise from start to finish.

Served neat in a Glencairn glass.",4.75

V.S.O.J.,"Batch 2, 2021.

V.S.O.J.,"I received a can of this famous Barleywine from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Can dated 6/29/2021. Poured into a Revolution Deep Wood Series glass also received from Mr. Barber. It pours a deep cola color with a fizzy, light khaki-colored head that dissipated quickly. It boasts a great Barleywine smell with toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, tobacco smoke, oak, and subtle but discernible bourbon. The taste is ridiculous! It's particularly fruity with lots of raisin, plum, and fig, along with loads of brown sugar and toffee, oaky char, tobacco, and a strong, hot bourbon presence. There is little bitterness. The tastes really pop; it's incredibly flavorful. Its mouthfeel is rich and creamy with appropriate and pleasant carbonation, and there's no escaping the 15% ABV; you can feel the alcohol burn.

Poured dark reddish brown with minimal head that dissipated quickly, no discernible foam either, but continuous bubbles appear from the depths of the glass.
The aroma was bourbon and malts, taste is almost sweet but isn’t, not sure how that happens. Figs, raisins, plums all swirling in the bourbon.
The taste rather follows, just more intense, amazing flavors and the 15% ABV is well hidden. Really, really good.
The feel is viscous enough to carry the weight of the flavors without being cloying. Great sipper!

V.S.O.J.,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color with a small collection of bubbles topping the poor.

Smell - The nose was sweet. Notes of caramel and earthy malts came before the booze.

Taste - Oh my! Caramel lead the way, followed by leather and mild bourbon. The booze was so perfectly balanced that it took nothing away from the base beer. This is an example of a beer that slept well in barrels. The profile was modestly warming but certainly did not burn.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick but not cloying. It lingered just long enough to have me wanting more.

Very dense and aromatic. Beer opens vanilla, caramel, and molasses. Oak and tobacco in the middle while the sweetness continues to heighten. More molasses, anise, booze, and brown sugar at the end with a sticky, lingering finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Rich and oily on the palate and goes down smooth, rich, and hot. Lingering aftertaste that sticks around for days.

8.2% New England style IPA by Treehouse

Poured into a tulip glass today from a pint can dated 7-12.

Magnificent aroma. Pineapple, Orange, passion fruit, lemon notes and a dankness provide a pleasurable experience. This aroma is the feature of the NE style that I like most. Use a tulip glass and enjoy the aroma throughout.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Juice Machine is a double NEIPA at 8.2% ABV, It's poured a murky orange and gold body beneath a two finger thick head of slightly yellowed off-white foam. The aroma suggests orange, mango, papaya, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is fuller, as usual, and offers up everything found in the nose along with additional notes of peach, some floral character, passionfruit, spiciness, a little bit of melon, zest of lime, some hop resins, and a touch of mint. The malt is sweetish and bready. A median bitterness balances it and it finishes dry with some hop resins and spiciness lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a lot of extra proteins but also with a little bit of zing from the acidic ""hop burn"". As usual for Treehouse the head has held up really well and there's a great amount of fancy lacing throughout the entire glass. I don't know if that's because of all the extra proteins or how carefully they're processing their beers (probably both) but they always have great head retention and lacing. This is my third can of Juice Machine and I've blown through them fairly quickly because although it's full of flavor and ""dank"", it's not as ""dank"" or intense as some of their other beers. They make a few NEIPAs that are even more accessible, and this is pretty complex so I'd put this somewhere in the middle range of what they do.

Juice Machine,"16 oz can poured into a wine glass. Pours a hazy yellow/orange with a billowy off-white head. Great retention and lacing - simply beautiful. Aroma and flavor feature sweet juicy tropical fruit, citrus zest, melon, creamy wheat, and hints of herbal/spicy/dank hoppiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated, but not as pillowy as Green/Alter Ego/certain other single NEIPAs from TH. Just a hint of booziness.

Orange with some tangerine and yellow tones, beyond turbid and almost murky, pours with a medium sized head and fades to a few wisps, leaves some nice lacing

Medium body, smooth and slick, carbonation on the low side

Juice Machine was a pseudo-whale for me for a while. For some reason I just could not get the timing right with my trips to Tree House and releases of this beer. Unfortunately, in the last half a decade or so since this debuted, Tree House has only become better at making beer. So it's not exactly mind-blowing compared to some newer offerings. If I have any real criticism, is that there is too much going on here. But I can see how some would really dig the laundry list of fruit flavors.",4.25

My first foray into the Julius “family” was King Julius a couple hours ago, and after pouring this guy, I see - and smell - a lot of similarities. The regular version appears to be slightly paler than the double version, and the head dissipated more quickly as well.

The nose on this however is hitting me more in the face than “King.” I’m getting wafts of canteloupe, mango and orange, and it’s very citrus-forward. Smells fantastic.

The taste is very similar as well, although this tastes slightly more malty, and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy. I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded, as well.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very cloudy brass-orange body beneath a finger's width of pillowy off-white foam. The aroma is not as bright as I thought it would be having just sampled a Juli-ish, which is their lower gravity/alcohol version of this. I'm getting some sweetish malt that's grainy but not overly so as I can smell the oats as well. It's fruity with soft orange and peach. The flavor is bright, floral, citrusy, and otherwise fruity. I'm getting orange, mango, melon, peach, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine, but not as much as I found in the Juli-ish. I guess the little bit of extra malt here is covering it up. I will say that this is much better balanced and rounded though. It's got a median bitterness that keeps it in check across the palate and then leads to a dry finish. I should also note that I found a lot of ""hop bite"" in the smaller beer, but not as much here; that made it seem drier than this. There's not a lot of fruit lingering, but there is some, and it's a touch mineralish. Yeah, this is really nicely balanced. I could drink at least 4 of these in a row. How strong is it? Ahh, just 6.8%? Make that 6 in a row. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. Based on what I'd heard of this beer I was expecting a true juice bomb that tasted like orange juice but that's not the case, this is so creamy and smooth that it comes across like an orange-creamsicle.

Holy. Fucking. Hell. I’m finally having this beer, and my lucky review #777. This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever, thanks to the incredible fo5s. Much appreciated bro, I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years. This is the #1 fruit Lambic, and has been for quite some time. It currently sits at #17 overall, and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal #777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic. I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this, with updated reviews to come. Alright, I know that was a lot of numbers, let’s just get into it now

Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This smells absolutely heavenly. Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasn't faded like some say that it has. I'm assuming it's more prominent in a fresher batch, but it's wonderful here too. I'm picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, aged leather, white grape, earthy wheat, doughy malt, light pepper, and lemon rind

This is unreal in taste as well, and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy apricot, underripe peach, wheat bread, straw, pear juice, lemon rind, and light oak. The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, peach rings, lemon rind, crackery malt, lime juice, and old leather

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and tart beer. Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars

I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers I've ever had. Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time. The 6% abv keeps it beyond drinkable, almost crushable, but that is not what I wanna do with this beer. I'm gonna cherish every last drop of this one. With the others I get, I'll see how it develops over time. Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one. Cheers BA!",4.75

Assassin,"On tap at Ansari's in Eagan MN the other day (the 2021version). Was very excited to see this beer on tap, even at the price point ($14.99 for a 4 ounce pour).

The beer poured the expected blackish brown color, with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention. Still, I didn't think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout. On the nose, I'm picking up dark chocolate, light licorice, some vanilla and a hint of cherry. Not really getting much of any bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout, but with a slight roasty component as well. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is pretty long. As others have noted, there's some sort of odd flavor in the finish. It's not bad, just unusual (a slight wet cardboard flavor). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, which I appreciate.

This is a nice beer no doubt, but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher. Likewise, the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well. I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansari's, and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole (a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin). Whatever. Each to their own. This is still a pretty good impy stout, but given the ""value quotient"" for this beer, I'm pretty sure this isn't something I'll ever need to order again.",4.25
Assassin,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color sottu with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some alcing. Aroma of woody bourbon notes with some light vanilla and residual sugar notes with some black chocolate notes and roasted malt notes also quite dominant. Taste is dominated by woody bourbon notes with some dark roasted malt and black chocolate notes with some vanilla and a rather dry finish. Body is full with a nice oily texture and good carbonation with some warming alcohol notes. Nice late night sipper.,4.5

Westly,Fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma. The aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk. Flavor is initially the fresh apricot flavor that's mostly sweet with tartness coming in behind it. The finish though is overwhelmingly sour. Great overall but acidity is strong with this one which detracts a bit from the sweet apricot fruit like notes I enjoy most.,4.25

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"Appearance - The beer was solid black in appearance with little carbonation rising to the tan head.

Smell - The nose was very coffee forward with the barrel being detectable as well. It was not overly sweet.

Taste - At the front, there was a generous taste of coffee. It was blended with a soft chocolate presence. There was a sweetness that brought to mind marshmallow or vanilla, but it was not overly sweet or cloying. Tour the back, the sweetness combined with the mellowed heat of the bourbon.

Mouthfeel - The feel was soft and slick, with light carbonation.

Pliny The Elder,"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden color, medium carbonation. A silky, frothy foam head. Leaves behind sticky lacing.

Aroma: A sweet, pungent hoppy aroma. Fragrant floral, citric, piney, and some herbal notes present.


Taste: A good, complex flavor profile. Starts off with a balanced blend of citrus rind, pine resin and grapefruit, and then evolves into a notable lingering tangy bitterness in the middle with some tropical fruits. All the while, subtle malts in the background compliment the whole thing, keeping it in composition. The bitterness rides all the way through the somewhat boozy finish.

Overall: This is a unique brew to say the least. Layer after layer, the aroma and flavor complexity played a game of hockey with my senses.",4.5

Pliny The Elder,"Tasted on tap at Native Son Ale house in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.

L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.

S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style.

T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style.

F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.

O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that.",4.5
Pliny The Elder,"Wow, have seen some sub 4 reviews of Pliny....wawhat??!! This is by far one of the best beers out there. Regardless of your hoppy beer type preference being pale ale, IPA, or stout, this DIPA will knock your socks off both with its wonderful taste as well as its effect. Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar. If I could keep a constant stock of Pliny the Elder available in my fridge I would, but alas it is a rare find down here in San Diego. Should have bought a case while I had the chance while at the high-end uber boujee Seaside Market in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. Maybe they have some left....hmmmm...I'll be back!",5.0
Pliny The Elder,"Pliny is synonymous with California beer. Whether it be the Elder or the Younger, the name is a brand within itself. We found the Elder hanging around Lake Tahoe and gave him a go.

Pliny The Elder,"Had on tap. Looks slightly hazed gold color with 2 finger white head of soft foam. Head fell to a cap after a few minutes. Left some nice lacing in the glass. Smell was all hops. A lot of tropical and citrus fruit is in the aroma. Taste enters sweet with a healthy dose of grapefruit, orange, mango. Middle has a bit of pithy bitterness and more tropical flavors but its balanced by a nice malt backbone. Finish is balanced with a slight hint of alcohol. Feel is medium bodied, lower carbonation but enough to provide a solid base for the flavor. Overall, well worth the wait for this classic expression. The flavors were bold, bright, and expressive. The beer was well balanced even with the bold hop presence. I enjoyed this a lot.",4.75
Pliny The Elder,"Long time coming. I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.

Cheers. TBB.",3.0

Bought in Colorado and brought back, a long-time want finally obtained after 26 hours of driving round trip (I did do other stuff on this trip, not just beer shopping). Just a classic flavor, nice balance but plenty of hoppy bitterness. Definitely worth the trip.",4.5
Pliny The Elder,"Appearance: Clarity is clear, silky head, laces the glass throughout the session and has a long lasting head retention. Perfect pale/bronze color.

Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background.

Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.

Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.

This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor.",4.5

Pliny The Elder,"Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.

Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.

Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.

Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.

Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed.",4.25
Pliny The Elder,"Comes in a crystal clear golden color, with a creamy, marshmallowy bright white head. Incredible retention with sheets of lacing.
The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel.
Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky.
Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.

For some reason only pioneer West Coast IPA's get this treatment for their style, never the pioneers of hazy IPA's of the Northeast. This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!

I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.

There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River.

Boy, those are some nice flavors. The bitterness level being high is certainly old school and a little more than I want, but it's not ripping my tongue off either. Hops are so fresh on this and almost clean. Flavors are a little more herbal and grassy than the aroma but still some nice fruit qualities as well.

CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Obtained a 4 pack for $35 at my local stout store. Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed. Ah well.",2.75

L: Very dark brown, almost black. Small head that settled quickly; very little lacing.
S: Low aroma, mainly of bourbon. The barrel is here but it's more oak than maple syrup. A little roasty, too.
T: Very sweet, but balances really well with the malt and the bourbon heat. I remember this being too much maple when it was new but after two years it's almost perfectly balanced.

Abner,"A really great double IPA! Had a pint at The Bench restaurant in Stowe VT. Pours a hazy orange color with a good size white head and good lacing on the glass. Mostly citrus aroma but nicely balanced with hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and moderately bitter. An outstanding Double IPA!!",4.25
Abner,Definitely a double. The alcohol flavor is produced more so than other hill farmstead beers. However the beer is truly a HF beer with the deep caramel hue and succinct crisp hoppiness that is so refined. Amazing beer but I prefer a lower alcohol beer.,4.25
Abner,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place.

Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.

Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.

Feel: Clean and full at the same time. Medium carbonation. Quite crushable.

Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. Some unexpected notes (smoke, gummy bears) are also in the mix, but everything fits in seamlessly. I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder. Great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of Hill Farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles.",4.5
Abner,"Draft at Armsby Abbey

Well damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this

Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind

It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced

Holy shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need more",4.5
Abner,"Had on tap. Pours a mostly clear light orange. Nice white head leaves a solid lace curtain. Smell and taste are fruity, with a little pine. Just an extremely well-crafted IIPA. Excellent.",4.5
Abner,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, from his massive NBS BIF # 15 hit. 16oz can (dated 8/18/20) poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid medium-dark orange color with a bit more than a half-inch of white head that had good retention and lacing.

A big blast of hops popped out of the can upon opening. Some citrus-orange scents, and some light frootiness. Very low grain presence.

Fairly similar on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol presence as well.

The body was fairly typical for the style, smooth and light.

Drinkability was good, especially sine the alcohol seemed to fade out a bit as it spent some time in the glass.

Overall, even though almost certainly faded, this still a really nice beer. Would like to try it fresh some time. Worth grabbing if you see it.",3.75
Abner,"can into glass
Bought at brewery, canned 12 days prior.
Brief, white head. Cloudy, medium orange, with a bit of amber on the side of the glass. Candied tangelo peel, mango, a touch of allspice and light caramelized malt, makes up the aroma. First ⅔ of taste is very good, with a candied tangerine peel, some mango and off-dry ( a wine term for nearly a complete lack of sweetness ), medium toasted, caramelized malts. As soon as these flavors fade, a sharp tangerine peel bite comes in and crowds out all else, for a long finish.",4.25
Abner,"Appearance - The beer was bright yellow in color with a bubbly white head that left generous lacing.

Smell - The nose was a bouquet of fresh lemons surrounded by dankness.

Taste - Initially, fresh but dry lemons led the profile. There was just a touch of sweetness like the East Coast style, but it was not liquid candy. The dankness really came through in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was nicely thick with an almost gritty body. Carbonation somehow survived the viscosity.

Overall - This is a great IPA, but I have had better.",4.5
Abner,"Can fresh from brewery.
Similar to heady topper but better.",4.75
Abner,The best of the Hill Farmstead IPAs in My opinion. Smooth and bitter and the same time and a very delicate balance. Nose of citrus and color is like fruit juice.,4.75

It says to drink by 6/8/21, so is this almost old?! Either way, it’s still fantastic. It looks, smells, and feels world class. It’s one of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had in a really long time. I would have guessed this is a 6.5% abv and not 8.2%. I love the bitterness throughout. Not West Coast style, but East Coast hazy like. I’m so happy to try this guy and will drink my remaining cans before they’re officially old!",4.5
Abner,"I couldn’t be more lucky than to have fantastic neighbors willing to share a can of Hill F Abner. This was my first and right off the bat its smooth. Dare

Double Sunshine,"Brewers Notes: This American double India pale ale is packed with juicy tropical fruit flavors and bright herbal aromas, thanks to the abundance of US-grown hops.

Double Sunshine,"Every super hero has a skill, they have a talent, they have a gift. They have the ability to do something that no one else can do and they use it for good. Lawson's finest has a gift for hops and they do good bringing a double dose of their best efforts to the New England craft beer community.

Double Sunshine pours with a strikingly hazy and golden orange appearance. Looking the part of most hazy ale, the beer floats a creamy dense meringue of tarnish froth before enticing the nose with a brisk and brazen citrus scent with an herbal perfume of citronella in a ripe, roaring and racy tone. Deliciously smooth and velvety in its malty upstart, the early palate is met with cereal, honey, caramel and cream.

As the malts settle on the palate, the hops simply begin to blossom with a bounty of branch-ripe Valencia orange, tangerine, mandarin and blood orange while inviting more fruits of nectarine and mango to add even more racy flavors. Red grapefruit tighten its hop taste as a late plunge into juicy notions of sherbet and push-ups. Trending firmly bitter with smooth pine, fragrant woods, citrus peel and herbal and a slightly dank vegetal bite.

Medium-full in body, the beer's bold flavors and creamy upstart finishes remarkably dry and resinous. A long but smooth bitterness is lasting with fruit peels and herb for a session that's classically hazy up front and traditionally bitter to finish- a best of both worlds.",4.75
Double Sunshine,"Canned 8/10/22.

L: Pours a clear orange gold with a big creamy white head that thins on top but sticks around the glass. Lacing is splotchy and irregular but pretty.

S: Surprising juicy fruit aroma, more similar to Sip than expected. A touch of grapefruit and herb.

T: More juicy fruit up front, pivoting to grapefruit in the middle, with a dry and slightly bitter finish. No heat.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation.

O: Combines some of the best elements of new school juiciness and old school clarity and bitterness. Well crafted.",4.25
Double Sunshine,Exceptional! Stopped at their brewery for the first time yesterday. No idea it was even there and turned around. Really glad I did. Tried two short pours as I was driving and tired. I love Sip and this is head and shoulders better in my opinion. It’s right up there with any beer in the country. Well done Lawson’s,4.75
Double Sunshine,Bright citrus with notes of mango and bitter grapefruit.,4.25
Double Sunshine,Pours clear as a lager (or old school IPA). Love that we still have delicious IPAs that are not turbid. Aroma of citrus grapefruit. I’m glad the grapefruit isn’t too much taste-wise. Citrus hops with the grapefruit in the background. Perfect creamy mouthfeel. Great beer.,4.5
Double Sunshine,"Pours a lightly hazy reddish golden with soapy white head. Some overripe mango and expressed grapefruit peel on the nose. A touch of mango but mostly citrus forward. Grapefruit is the central flavor that comes to mind. It's sticky, sappy, chewy. The chewiness of this is really what I'm enjoying the most. I remember this being much more tropical and less citrus forward when I had had it before but those are blurry memories from beer festivals and my palate memory is much more developed now than it was at that time. However, this is still a really nice DIPA that doesn't really have any rough edges.",4.25
Double Sunshine,Outstanding. Better than Heady Topper...but not by much.,4.75

Double Sunshine,"Small but lasting head. Some streaks for lace. Darker gold color. Clear.

Light earthiness. Some spiciness in the form of nutmeg or cinnamon. Good pale malt base, slightly sweet.

Drier than the smell. The body leans rich but the carbonation is also elevated. The hop bitterness shows up just prior to the swallow. The finish is approaching astringency. The hop is similar To black pepper. The aftertaste draws out some warmth from the alcohol. Surprisingly easy to drink with a good blend of all of the elements throughout the tasting.",4.25
Double Sunshine,"Quick review, can purchased at brewery:
Mostly clear with strong lacing; Nose is a bit light, fruity; taste starts a little sweet, with a hint of burn, but balances quickly and then slowly becomes bitter.

Double Sunshine,"I finally got this up in Vermont this summer. I was expecting too much from it based on other people's ratings. I actually prefer SOS to the double. Don't get me wrong, this is a great DIPA, but I am getting bitter taste from the hops rather than the sweet taste I get from SOS. I love how this beer is clear, amber from the delicious malt, well-carbonated, and easy to drink.",4.5
Double Sunshine,"Pours a clear crisp orange-yellow color with a thick but airy white colored head that laces nicely on the way down. Aroma of floral hops, earthy smells and some sweet malts at the end of it. Tastes of toasted malts, nice earthy and slightly citrus hops and a warming alcohol feel at the back end. Thicker feeling than it looks, warming, nice amount of carbonation. Overall, this is what I miss about Double IPAs made in New England.",4.5

Framboise Du Fermier,"750 ml bottle, poured into a New Glarus glass at ~40 degrees F.

S: The nose is all tart raspberries, with some soft oak tannins wafting in the backdrop.

T: Sharp, tart, sour raspberries, with just a slight tang beneath of oak.

F: Light, and not terribly lively.

O: Definitely framboise to the core, with a du Fermier acidity.",4.5

Overall - just fantastic and super tartness with a ton of raspberry",4.5
Framboise Du Fermier,"Pours a dull, matte pink that resembles the fresh of grapefruit. No foam on this bottle pour. Pour is from the bottom 1/3 of the bottle. Aroma is strong raspberry (had it all caps in my notes). Stone and grass add depth, before a tart finish dries out the nose and cues a sip. Flavor profile is raspberries through and through. Stone, grass, and grapefruit round out each sip. It's sweet, then tart. Mouth feel is creamy with a mild silt throughout. Thickness is medium-thick, coming in on the more full side of saisons. Overall, a plump, ripe saison jammed up and full of raspberries.

Bottle pour. Reviewed from notes.",4.75
Framboise Du Fermier,"750 ml bottle today. Poured a deep and dark ruby color. Beautiful beer in the glass. Instant aroma of raspberries. Very fragrant. Smells fruity and tart.

Morning Wood,"22oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle, but was told this was a 2018 vintage of Morning Wood.

Poured into Durobar Charente glass.

Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down.

Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.

Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all.

Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure.",4.5
Morning Wood,"Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.

Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish.",4.5
Morning Wood,On tap at Castaways for the tap takeover. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Loads of maple and bourbon aromas. The taste follows suit with pronounced black coffee and dark roasted malts. Hints of oak. Good body and mouthfeel.,4.25

T: roasty coffee, chocolate malt, maple/brown sugar, Slight smoke and/or bitterness. No bacon specifically.
F: medium.
Overall: Very good porter. Hard to distinguish between this and a stout. Maple sweetness and coffee dominate. Reminds me of beers I recently had... mornin’ delight, kbbs, cbs, and that’s a pretty high compliment considering their ratings. Clearly world-class barrel aging going on.",4.75
Morning Wood,"I got this in a trade, and the date is smudged off :-(

Appearance: Poured 1/4th of a glass every time so not too much head. Pitch black of course. Some lacing.

Aroma: Impressive -- maple, coffee, and smoke all shine through.

Flavor: Overall sweet almost like a milk stout. Maple syrup throughout, strong coffee throughout as well. Milk chocolate. The barrels come through if you pay attention. There's a slight smokiness on the back end, which is such a great addition. There is absolutely no heat. The advertised flavors do not lie... however I don't get much more than that. Not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more.

Palate/Finish: Medium but oily and sticky. Very smooth, no carb. I do wish this was thicker, but I also realize that this is a porter so I won't knock it too much. Finishes with more coffee and sticky maple.

Overall: This is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade. I was hoping for something to 'chew' on, but at the same time, the style *is* porter, and I do admire that. The alcohol is completely hidden, and the maple/coffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma. This is what impressed me most. On the other hand, it's not the most complex imperial porter I've had, and it's a little lactos-y. Overall, I'm gonna say this is an A beer, but not an A+.",4.5

JJJuliusss!,"Canned on 7/29/22; consumed on 9/2/22

Pours a turbid, dark orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of rich cap, a massive, fluffy collar, and myriad spattering of chunky lacing tossed around the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights mango gummies accented with a slight mustiness hinting toward a boggier overlay of guava peel and tropical compost over time; a dense, bready malt backing remains prevalent as light papaya and melon brings a soft freshness to the back end.

Taste offers mossy mango contrasting tangy orange juice upfront, with lingering guava engaging distant melon over the mid-palate while sweet, boggy-dank sensations flow alongside a lime-pineapple juiciness on the back end.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a moderate, rounded carbonation soon easing to resoundingly creamy, smooth textures; a juicy twang levels density past the mid-palate to an effortless, pillowy grit lingering on the finish.

A tropical hop smoothie, extensively creamy and leveled with weighty resins in-flux with the rampant saturation; a busy density attenuated to Tree House's usual high standard of NEIPA.",4.25

JJJuliusss!,"Tree House Brewing Co. ""JJJuliusss""
16 fl. oz. can coded ""JJJUST GGGREAT 04/29/22 07:48:00"". Sampled on 05/15/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: The can that I have in front of me is labeled JJJuliusss without an exclamation point and the label is white, not orange, but I'm pretty sure this is the same beer. The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It's poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger's width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn't happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It's sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It's threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It's got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it's medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can't say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more. I'll have to try to get a hold of more of both to do a side-by-side.

JJJuliusss!,"Pours a murky dark orange with two fingers of dense yellowed foam head. Great retention and thick rings of lacing.

Big orange in the nose. Hints of passionfruit, plum and gummy bears.

Same lovely mix of tropical fruits and orange citrus in the taste. A little herbal greeness and light pith in the finish creates some great balance that prevents the beer from being sweet.

Very soft, pillowy feel with restrained carbonation.

A top of class NEIPA. Tons of depth among the varied fruit flavors along with good light bitterness for balance.",4.5

Feel: Full and juicy. Low carbonation. Slightly sharp.

Dinner,Been waiting over a decade to try this beer and even longer to visit the brewery. Finally did both! Had it on draft and took a few bottles home with a date of 26AUG22. This absolutely meets the hype. Incredibly delicious and absurdly drinkable for the ABV and style. SO fruity and so floral. The smooth body and delicate mouthfeel are truly impressive. This is the real deal.,4.75
Dinner,"Pours a dirty darker straw color; cloudy but see through; white head that laces quite beautifully, a dense film lingers and lingers.

The aroma literally jumps out of the glass on this beer; it has an essential oil like brightness to it, incredibly vibrant. A mix of fresh in season fruits; nothing tropical to me just local summer fruits, but with an extra citrus like bite to it; a little bit of vegetal dank on the finish, it cuts short of onion garlic territory for me.

Taste is much of the same but the beer becomes less fruity more citrus, pithy, with a pretty nice minor sweet malt presence; slight resin/sap aftertastes.

This is a double IPA that is for sure; it has a pretty hefty body, higher end of medium. A very clean drinking beer, dry and biting bitterness on the finish, prickly sappy tingling on the tongue. Also letting you know this is a double IPA is the slight alcohol presence on the finish, no overbearing by any means but present.

Well it is easy to see why this beer has the reputation it does. The aroma alone is intoxicating but the flavors and feel combine to make this a very good beer; I love the bite and big hop presence on such an aromatic beer. Lovely beer.",4.5
Dinner,"I've never come across this highly regarded beer, so was pleasantly surprised to see it on tap when I was out to dinner last night. The appearance was that of.....beer. Cloudy and medium yellow, with almost no head. The lack of head could certainly be chalked up to the fact that it had probably been a minute or two between the pour and its arrival at my table. Regardless, while there was nothing wrong with the appearance, nothing particularly stood out either.

The nose was a different story. I'm desensitized to IPA aromas at this point, but this beer smelled amazing Loads of citrus, mango and other tropical notes. Simply an excellent smelling beer.

The taste was very nice, but not as tropical as the nose. Grapefruit was the only taste I could pick out, but whatever else was there it was above average, but didn't blow me away (keeping in mind I'm not a big lover of IPAs). The feel, however was amazing. Very full, creamy and pillowy. Absolutely excellent.

Overall, I though this was a very good beer, led by the aroma and the feel. I hope to be able to luck into some bottles sometime right around a NBS BIF so I can share it with others.",4.0
Dinner,"From a 16.9oz bottle, dated 07/29/22. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a just barely hazed honey-gold with two-plus fingers of pouffy, shaving cream-like foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat bubbly-sudsy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing.

Nose is sweet, malty, and layered with aromas of orange peel and pine needles.

Taste is as expected, leaning into the sweet and malty end of balanced. The earthy-woody pine needle, resinous character is prominent, along with caramel sweetness, oily orange peel and a squeeze of lemon.

Feel is clean, just a little too brisk to pass as smooth (entirely in a good way) and no more than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. There’s a cheerful hop oily tingle on the tongue and a slight boozy warmth in the gullet.

As always when rating MBC bottles, overall score is marked down 0.25 in recognition of the stupid, overpriced pint-plus bottles. Because principles, right? (Replaces a 4.46 rating without a review from 11/05/15… thank you, Dr. J. for the rare opportunity to have this one again).",4.25

Dinner,"On tap at Sabatini's in Exeter pa yesterday.

Looks very good in the glass. Honey yellow body with a nice white head. This eventually shrinks to a thin ring, good lacing early on.

Delightful hoppy aroma with a side of mixed fruit favoring the non citrus.

On tasting, smooth, hoppy, delicious. Fruit notes confirm the nose. Very easy drinking, abv fairly well hidden but you get the feel of it.

Mouth close to full, finish manages to be clean, but full of hop flavor.

Overall, have missed out on this one the last few times it was at Sabz. Not this time. Beautifully crafted dipa. Seemingly simple, but a lot of thought has gone into producing this classic.",4.5
Dinner,"Look - hazy thick golden copper color with a really nice white head that sticks around and leaves great rimming and lacing when drinking

Taste - class dipa with it's hop bitterness. Citrus floral pine like the smells with a slight booze.
Feel - full body and carb
Overall - the smell is just ibcyand I was hoping the taste was going to live up to it but in my opinion it didn't. Great classic ipa though",4.25
Duck Duck Gooze,"Received from @dimidiata. Pours a bright golden color with a small amount of short-lived white head that receded to a thin ring. Fully translucent, almost clear. Aroma has tons of funk, well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. Overall a wonderful smelling beer.

Taste picks up right where the nose left off. I get apricots, wine barrel, apple vinegar, lemon, hay and general barnyard funk. Acidity is spot on. Tart, but it doesn't beat you over the head, allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. Light bodied, bright, crisp and clean.

Overall, an absolutely wonderful beer.",4.75
Duck Duck Gooze,"2022 vintage

Review 1100!! I figured I’d bust out a special bottle for the occasion, and what’s better than the highest rated Gueuze on BA? Well, Gueuze-inspired I should say, based on recent thread. Whatever the fuck we wanna call it, I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it

After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle, it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Wow, this is super bright in the nose, just an absolute. punch of funk. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, sharp oak, old leather, wet hay, vinegar, apple skin, dried apricot, tart white wine (surprising given the red wine barrel aging), and general floral notes. Really all over the place but fantastic

While it's not as incredible in taste, it is still very damn good, just less sharp than you'd expect based on the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting wet hay, lemon zest, jammy apricot, white wine vinegar, pear, white pepper, dry oak, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of bright white wine, stone, lemon yogurt, orange juice, apple skin, straw, and light honey

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and zesty beer. Finishes very dry with a balanced tartness

Super annoying cork aside, this is a fantastic treat of a beer! There's something special about this one doing a very convincing Belgian impersonation, in the most flattering way. I need to get more to cellar, cheers BA!",4.5
Duck Duck Gooze,"the 2016 is on point right now. Very complex, sharp and interesting wine barrel aged sour. if you haven't had a chance it's very much worth seeking this beer out!",4.5
Duck Duck Gooze,"Was so hyped for this beer, and it is good...but left feeling disappointed overall",4.5
Duck Duck Gooze,"2016 Vintage

750ml corked and caged bittle - poured into a Riesling/Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

Pours a slightly foggy translucent honey-golden, really verging on orange, like a West Coast IPA. A finger of coarse, sticky, sudsy off-white head forms, with fair retention, and settling to a decent collar, with weak, spotty lacing. Clings to the glass like whiskey. Really a beautiful beer.

Nose: This one travels. No shortage of funk here. Tons of damp hay and wine-soaked oak, with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind. There's ample leather book binding, dusty stone cellar, petrichor, magnolia blossom, and a really dense note of patchouli, with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through. Some funky stable, sea shell minerality, and sweaty brett emerge, but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness. Huge nod to Cantillon here.

Palate: Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity. Like biting into a ripe stone fruit, there's a bright *POP* of tartness, but it immediately steps back, becoming more of a lemony tang. Lemon oil, orange juice, apricot, and crabapple lend bright fruity notes, with undertones of cabernet grape, cranberry, unripe plum, and coriander seed. The tartness begins to rapidly subside, showing quite a bit of grain - dusty, with hulls. An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay, damp wood, old musty stable air, milkweed, and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk. The tartness completely disappears, and the finish shows wheaty grain, grass, lemon essence, white oak, and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate.

Mouthfeel/Body: Absolutely stunning. It's crisp, airy, and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality, but there's definitely some soft body which lends presence. The effervescence is truly perfect. Champagne. Zippy, airy, fluffy, and fizzy, but soft and supple. An oily feel lingers.

Overall: This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale I've had in a long time, perhaps ever. I'm not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not, but either way, this really is a masterpiece. A sweet grain presence, incredibly balanced acidity, ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes, and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly, this has truly transcended the style itself. Simply stunning.",4.75

Duck Duck Gooze,"2016 release, enjoyed in 2020. Light orange-golden, unfiltered but pretty transparent and bubbly. No residual lacing. Bright and floral, quite tart on the first sip, but sweeter and fruitier after that. Apricot, peach, grapefruit, bits of cranberry and granny smith. Light straw and funk underneath the sourness.",4.75
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.

Huge aroma. Smells of mangoes, mandarins, peaches and canteloupe. Some earth in the background on warming.

Taste is bitterness up front-earth and pine with juice in the background-citrus and mango. nice balance of juice and bitterness.

Soft, full-bodied, thick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Citrus rind aftertaste.

Yeah, well, this is incredible. Incredibly balanced for a bigger beer.",4.5
Very HHHazyyy,"16 oz can. It says ""It had to happen"". Well so did this review.

Pours a muddy pale gold color with a finger of fluffy, effervescent white head. Smaller head than expected, but the retention is real. Leaves a massive crown of lacing along the top of the glass.

Oh my dear lord the smell of this beer. How is there no fruit puree here? There's a nuclear amount of stone fruit, as well as some fresh mango, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit pith. The signature Tree House yeast is also very present with a hint of vanilla.

The flavor follows the nose to a T, but adds a nice vanilla bean character, as well as some melon and fruit stripe bubblegum. This is just stupid.

The feel is medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Creamy and pillowy soft. A hint of booze.

Overall, this beer is absolutely deserving of any hype it receives. I am a long admitted Tree House fanboy, but I'd consider myself well-versed with NEIPA's and can tell which ones are good and which ones are not, regardless of bias. This one is unquestionably good.",4.75

Samuel,"Finally cracking this bottle after getting it in one of the HF home delivery programs many months ago. Pours less billowy than many of the HF offerings, with little head retention or lacing to speak of. This is a superbly well-rounded and nuanced offering, with all of the characteristics of a rustic saison, a fine effervescent white wine, and a barrel aged sour all-in-one, with no one attribute dominating the others. $60/750ml is very high, but this is barely over into 'worth it' territory

93/100",4.5
Samuel,"Bottle. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Mild vinous bouquet. Good stuff. Wine barrel gives way to tasty farmhouse notes. Not crazily complex but so solid, clean, and refreshing. A over average body and mouthfeel.",4.75
Samuel,"This one pours a golden and bright orange color, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like hay, minerally funk, lemon candy, grassy funk, honey, oak, white wine, grape, sweet floral funk, and pear skin.

This is absolutely phenomenal, and represents the best of what Hill Farmstead is capable of. The recipe appears to be a cross of two of my favorite beers that Hill Farmstead has ever done - Vera Mae and Le Sarrasin - so this beer has been on my list for a while now. It's got this wonderfully fresh and lemony taste to it, like funky lemon candy, with that rustic funk - pear, citrus, grassy, a little bit of herbal and mineral character, along with lots of oak spice. There's also an outstanding sweet floral honey-like flavor.

This is light bodied, effervescent, and very drinkable. Taking down an entire 750 of this one would be absolutely no problem.

This is in the top 3 of all Hill Farmstead beers I've ever had, and it's maybe even the best beer overall that I've ever had. It's honestly perfect.",5.0

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut

It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat

Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.

This is not as fresh as I hoped to try it, but I’m sure it hasn’t faded all that much. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy medium brown/red with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s super fruity in the nose, with a huge booze and yeast complexity to it. I’m picking up on aromas of red grape, dates, brown sugar, port wine, nutty malt, earthy toffee, molasses, clove, and light red apple

Oh man, in taste it is much more malt driven, but it’s still plenty fruity and complex. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel, red grape, sweet caramel, peppercorn, baked apple, brown sugar, clove, toasted nuts, and light port wine.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Found randomly in the fridge at Beer360 in Richmond, Australia in November 2021. The proprietor told me there were a number hidden away in the fridge to see if anyone found them and realised what they were. I sure as hell did! This review is based on some hastily scribbled notes, so might be somewhat sparse in comparison to the complexity presented by this wonderful beer. The beer was drunk in April 2022.

In the glass, the beer presents a burnt, muddy brown, pushing towards over-ripe, bruised plum in colour. There's a thin, off-white head.

The aroma is dark cherries, brown sugar, plum, red fruits, dark cherry and Christmas cake.

The taste is complex and ever-changing. There are dark fruits, red fruits, brown sugar and booze at first, and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur, cough syrup, sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake, with the booze backing off. There is almost certainly more peeking through, but everything intermingles so well together it's hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange.

The mouthfeel is full and smooth.

Overall, there's a reason this is so sought after. It's my second-highest-rated beer on Untappd (behind KBS) and, without looking, I suspect it will be my highest on BA. It's also the most expensive beer I've ever bought, coming in at around $55AUD for a 330ml bottle, which is about $48 more than an average beer! Nevertheless, it's grabbed without hesitation every time I see it.

Cheers!",4.75
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Amazing Quadrupel. If you cannot get your hands on it, just go with the St. Bernardus ABT.

It gets even better with a few years age on it if stored properly with existing molasses and chocolate undertones coming out in full force. There is a reason why this is a top rated bier for decades and not just because it is difficult to obtain.",5.0
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),So this is what a Belgian quad is supposed to taste like. Not a thing wrong with anything here. Glad I could try it.,4.25
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Re-reviewing 4/7/2022, the second time I’ve enjoyed this beer.

330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.

Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light.

Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep.

Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden.

Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right.

Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class.
___________________________________________

Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:

Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)

330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.

Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.

Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.

This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.

(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)",4.75
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"been holding on to this one for a while now, been finding the right excuse to have it, and i was ireland lose to belgium in the football, i decided now was as good a time as ever to have this most legendary of beers, a beer like this can never live up to its reputation, but to be fair it is damn nice, it has a complexity to it that the other two great belgian quads (sb12 and tr10) dont have so much, black bread, dark chocolate, and raisins and plum combined with almost saison-esque leathery flavours, oaky, earthy, little bit of vanilla, spice, liquorice, medium bitterness on the finish, delicate body with high levels of carbonation, little bit of warming from the alcohol, dryness on the finish, fruity flavours and spice linger, maybe not the best beer in the world, but it really is quite good, an essential for any beer enthusiast, glad i finally got to try it",4.5
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Bought by appointment at the monastery, a crate each of 12, 8 and blonde. The 12 is a monster. Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise.",5.0
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.",4.75
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle with no label and a gold cap into a chalice glass. I purchased six bottles dated ""12.10.24"" which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the ""best by"" date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated ""19.01.14"" which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the ""best by"" date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.

APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.

SMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.

PALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: to me this is not the ""best beer in the world"", it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.

Look 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4

APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.

SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.

PALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible.",4.25
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Received as part of NBW BIF #13 and just now getting to it. BB date was 12/22 so I am guessing it was about 4 years old.
Poured the color of cold brew coffee and sports a manilla color head which leaves copious lacing.
The aroma was stone fruit and malts, I tried to find spices but failed. Still, excellent aroma.
The taste, wow; while it pretty much followed the aroma, the layers and power of flavors is impressive. Stone fruit mingling with biscuit like malts and they made an excellent pair.
The feel was very good, way too easy to drink. I expected something more viscous but this really works.
OA, excellent beer and so glad I got to try it!",5.0
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"I don’t know how old the bottle is, but purchased relatively recently and shipped from Belgium to me in Chicago. First off I think this is the coolest bottle I’ve ever had. Who else could get away with no label?! I don’t get a ton off of the nose, but I can tell it’s a quad and I’m liking it. It’s a gorgeous looking beer when poured too. It has an impressive full mouthfeel with the perfect carbonation. There’s a bit of a tart dry finish that I really like as well. Overall this is worth the hype and I hope the style doesn’t lose its popularity anytime soon.",4.75
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),Even looking at the no label bottle with the engraved circle is somewhat imposing. This one had rested for about 5 years. It poured a dark plum to prune color with still a good level of carbonation. The aroma was wonderful stone fruit. The complex character was true to form as still to me the best beer in the world. It made the perfect Thanksgiving beer and made me appreciate the good things in the world. Cheers.,5.0
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Thanks to Coronaeus for this, probably my biggest 'Want' ever. This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.

The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.

On the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.

The body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.

Drinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.

Overall, a truly great beer, worthy of all its multitude of praises. A must try for any beer lover.",5.0

Feel: smooth, a bit of heat, suprising as everyone says you can't detect the alcohol at all

Overall: the big question: is it the best beer ever? not as far as I can tell. it is fantastic, but it does have a bit of alcohol tang/bitterness/heat. a fantastic quad, but i'd probably take st. bernadus most days, especially because it's so much easier to get (this bottle was $39.99). no regrets, happy to cross it off the list, but i won't be seeking it out...unless I'm in belgium",4.0

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Usually I blind-taste beers but I've read so much about this one over the years I certainly know of it's reputation.

This is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed...
L- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. ps@+10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down.
S- Quite malty with a light hint of spice.
T- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish.
F- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops.
O- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts. Worth the after-market price? Certainly once...

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Thought I’d never score one…much less three…thanks Michele!

Poured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying.

The wife asked if it was worth $50 a bottle? Is any beer “worth” $50 a bottle. Yes. Plus it’s a story of history, with a present day support of a simpler lifestyle and dedication to higher purpose.",5.0

Double Citra®,"Canned on 10/6/21; consumed on 10/28/21

Pours an almost turbid golden burnt orange body capped with two fingers of lush, fluffy, white foam; good head retention yields a thin layer of cap, a hearty, expansive collar, and generous spread of webby/spotty lacing coating the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to deeply floral citrus refined to fresh orange juice accents and a fluffy lime underlay; papaya rind and soft melon ease over the middle as tinges of black peppercorn phased effortlessly into flaky, plush malt profile on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste shows mango upfront grazed with pineapple tart transitioning to lemon meringue against a fluffy malt base over the mid-palate; melon touches the back end, a briefly sweet interlude as musty grass and delicate, underripe passionfruit and grapefruit finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation, dispersing a hoppy twang fusing to juiciness over the mid-palate; the back end highlights a zesty character invigorating a taut, drying finish.

Waves of stimulation texture effortlessly attenuated character, seeing a pillowy malt profile support zesty citrus and pangs of sweeter tropical nectar in playful contrast; common with Hill's DIPAs, stimulating yet universally approachable displays.",4.5

Double Citra®,"L: Gorgeous cream hazy wheat. About 1/2 inch of frothy head with lacing that hangs on the side of the glass.

S: Aroma comes bounding out of the can. The Citra is overwhelming, in a good way. Stone fruit, papaya, ripe melon. Wow.

T: Citra at the front, leading to pine/resin, with sweet fruit here and there. Not an overwhelming alcohol-flavor either, despite the 8%

F: This is quite effervescent, with a peppery and dry finish. Just an absolutely perfect amount of carbonation - enough of a bite to notice, but also simultaneously juicy and mouth-watering.

O: This is a spectacular beer. What puts this double with Citra above many others is that it hits every piece perfectly - aroma, taste, mouthfeel. Many juicy IPAs pack in the aroma or flavor, but really miss with the high alcohol content and mouth feel and either come off as too strong, or flat.

Heavy sweet tropical fruits on the nose, balanced with lovely floral and herbal notes, breadiness, and a slight bite of pine. But if the familiar Juicy Fruit characteristics of a big TH hazy, but also a yeasty element. Each whiff is a little different than the last.

Taste could follow but is a little overwhelmed by a starchy green element, which takes it down a notch or two. Still heavy tropical fruit, very juicy, with a nice semi-sweetness. The grassiness overshadows any breadiness or pine characteristics that might be present. The can describes a sharp but pleasant finish, which I was hoping meant a nice bitterness. But this is more of a sharp green, chalky note that steels from the experience.

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a more intense version of their ""doppelganger"". An inch and a quarter of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far, falling in a little bit and become rocky looking. The aroma is pretty bright with notes of orange, berries, other tropical fruit, apple, hops resins, and pine. The taste keeps it going with additional notes of mango, honeydew melon, pssionfruit, and grapefruit. The malt is sweetish and bready, supporting the hop notes. A moderate bitterness and a fair amount of acidic ""hop bite"" balance it and it finishes dry with some fruit, resin, earth, and pine lingering. The head has held up really well and the lacing is fantastic. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gently crisp carbonation and a little zest from all of the hop acids, and then smooth towards the finish because of all the extra proteins. This one is really nicely balanced.

Doubleganger,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy and stable white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

Smell: A combination of ripe orange and tropical mango and pineapple. Hoppy, dank and sweet. A bit sharp.

Taste: Citrusy notes of orange, tangerine and grapefruit with subtle tropical hints. Not as sweet es the smell suggests. Zesty, bitter and slightly sharp.

Feel: Very juicy. Medium carbonation. Smooth and silky.

Overall: Even though smell and look were almost perfect right from the beginning, it took a bit for the taste to fully develop. A bit too green and bitter when cold, it developed into a smooth and nicely balanced juice with just the right amount of everything. One of the best Tree House beers I've had so far.",4.75

Doubleganger,"Average pour fills two-thirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam, takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip, curiously not much stick to the lacing. The liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer, impenetrable and immobile. The nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness, roofing tar, pine sap and thick, sticky pineapple, mango, kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve, not teasing out any citrus nor florality. Full-bodied, without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate. In turn while it's juicy and ""damp"" at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end. Notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, intense fruit flavors. Vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then. Still barely registering any citrus, pink grapefruit if anything. On the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert. Scores points for sheer bombast but I'd be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row, it's that tiring. (Canned 7/30/21)",4.25

Maman,"'20 batch.

Maman 2020 is a blend of 2 distinct threads. The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke.

This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here.

This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this.

It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially.",5.0

Ann,"Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. The nose is somewhat bland with barrel highlights. Real smooth with good carbonation. Light citrus and orange notes with floral/herbal and woody undercurrents. To be honest, after all the hype, I was expecting a whole lot more.....",3.75
Ann,"My long time white whale, we meet at last...

As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head.

The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time.

Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right.

Bottled 2015, released 2019. Thanks Stanley!",4.5
Ann,"Awesome to finally try this; great wine, light funk, touch of honey up front; Anna’s funk and honey comes through nicely, with nice sweetness, grains of paradise, mild mild tartness in back; the honey pops as it warms, super flavorful, floral finish. Wow.",4.75
Ann,"Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach. Taste is something else, oaked white wine, apricot, peach, light cellar notes, white grape, hay, picking up a light honey-sweetness and very light funkiness. Lighter body, carbonation holding up pretty well.",4.75
Fuzzy,"Appearance - The beer was the color of a peach. It was orange with red hues toward the center.

Smell - The beer smelled like sour peaches. There was an undercurrent of sweetness, like vanilla.

Taste - The profile was quite acidic, like a soured peach. Notes of peach and peach skin were detected. There seemed of be the presence of vanilla sweetness as well. The profile had a nice sour peach finish.

Mouthfeel - The body had little carbonation, but a pleasant smoothness.

Overall - This is a sour that I can enjoy, and I am not a sour guy.",4.5
Fuzzy,"This was a guest beer on tap during the 2021 Zwanze Day celebration I attended.
2020 Fuzzy, at a year’s age.

Loved the nose on this. Stone fruit in season, white peach and a hint of funk. It’s tart, without being overly sour, with a nuanced finish. More of the peach notes, leaving the palate tingling. Fantastic.",4.5
Fuzzy,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance

S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals

T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness

M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs

O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition",4.25

Fuzzy,"375mL bottle into a Teku
Blend 4 (aka Vintage 2020)

A: Pops and is a gusher which is inexcusable as this has sat undisturbed for months. Several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom. Color is apricot yellow/orange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously. Once that’s gone it actually looks flat. It’s quite hazy, nearly opaque. Certainly not much of a looker.

S: Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters. Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot. Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance, I would say the tart/sour characters are moderate on the nose. A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out.

T: Taste is very delicious. Much more sour than the nose, with huge puckering tartness. Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance, it’s very orange-family fruit forward with notes of oranges, tangerines, nectarines. Peace is primarily on the finish, but is quite nice. Pretty big lemon tartness as well. Really fantastic.

M/D: Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass, drinkability is very good.

O: Overall, this is an excellent beer, no doubt. Although #37 overall rating on BA seems damn high. Fair or not, I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics, and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon. Regardless, still a treat, and would happily drink any day of the week.

Happy New Year BA’s!

Fuzzy,"Beautiful looking beer, pungent aromas of fuzzy peach skin, under-ripe white peach flesh, lemony acidity, and a hint of peach rings and oak. the nose on this is really wonderful.

wish I could say the same about the taste - I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product. there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive, but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity. getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar, white grape and vanilla. don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this beer, but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh ...

Fuzzy,"Review #500: Side Project - Fuzzy

Batch 4 (2020) 375ml - poured into a tulip at 42°F.

Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25

Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright. There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart.

Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean.

Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point.",4.5

Nectarine Premiere,"Bottled September 2020

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing

Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt

Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk

Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that? I plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night",4.5

Nectarine Premiere,"this one has been on my most wanted list for awhile, so huge thanks to my boy for scoring this for us to share, what a gem! its as good as i hoped it would be, the nectarine popping in here, natural and juicy, the essence of the fruit as so many de garde beers deliver, and it seems right in its peak, bottle from september 2020. pale brew with some haze through most of the bottle, very fizzy but not holding a ton of head, and a nose that my mouth is still watering from, wow its puckery, nectarous, and juicy, ripe and sweet and sour at the same time, wood heavy, fully wild, incredible aroma here and it gets better as it warms, more fruit, more funk, more wood. the flavor is fantastic, the fruit hits mostly at the end, its mature vinous funky wild beer up front, slightly raw on the grain side maybe some unmalted wheat in here, pils malt, doughy and crackery and simple but earthy. the ferment is sharp but not overly sour, tannic from the oak, maybe some white wine character too, lots of well developed bretty funk too. when the fruit hits its like taking a bite of a ripe nectarine, and it stays on the tongue through the finish. impressively real, forward, and its crazy this is as dry as it is because the fruit is so sweet, amazing. this has already developed well in the bottle, but i think its safe to say even more time would evolve it further. its maybe not as complex on the yeast side as my favorite de garde beers, but the fruit element is as good as it gets. great carbonation here too, lively and excited feeling on the palate, fits the summery fruitiness. loved this, very thankful! i know this is one of their highest rated beers, but its probably not even in my top five from them, amazing as it is...",4.5

KBS,"Poured from bottle into snifter after about a day in the 50 degree wine cooler.
Look: deep brown, nearly black, with a light coffee colored head. Delightful
Smell: IMO this is the best part of the KBS. Comes off almost like a Mexican hot chocolate with deep chocolate notes, some small cinnamon hints. Booziness apparent from the scent.
Taste: Matches the smell nearly to a T. Heavy alcohol heat throughout with the chocolate notes brightening as it leaves your mouth. Just like a barrel stout should be. Quite sweet, but even as someone who doesn’t love sweet beers, it’s great.
Feel: Carbonation is quite low, so the combination of the stout density and boozy heat creates a rather unique, slick feel in the mouth. High sugar content seems to be enhanced by the slick feel.
Overall: King of barrel aged stouts for me. Great stuff",4.75
KBS,"Preface by saying I’m not the biggest stout fan.

Bottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°

Overall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly!

L: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom.

S: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall

T:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes.

Taste: Definitely tasting the heavy chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The initial taste is coffee, followed by the taste of coffee, finishing with the bourbon after taste. Very nice!!!!
Feel: Getting light carbonation - very smooth. Very well hides the alcohol.

T---Wow, very flavorful and nuanced. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla are all distinct. ABV is well hidden behind sweetness.

KBS,"I recently tried and reviewed Founders - Breakfast Stout, which is also highly regarded. Similar to that review, I will state that I actively dislike coffee. Both the taste and the smell. So I don't foresee me falling in love with this beer, but I did want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about.

L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.

S - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.

T - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.

F - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink.

O - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.

Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.",4.0

I introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking.

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This review is based on a 2020 label date opened in 2022, stored under dark refrigeration. This beer ages well, no doubt.

Look: Very dark, and is about as translucent as used Diesel motor oil, which is to say it is quite opaque. It is a very dark brown in color, with a medium brown head.

Smell and taste: Bourbon (of course), chocolate, tobacco, some dried hay, some smoke but not a lot. and more and more roasted loveliness. The alcohol burn is there, but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive. Everything is balanced, which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers. Take a sip, and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish, front to back. There is a lot of variety here.

Feel: As at least one other review mentions, for its massive burst of robust, intense flavor, it is not a thick beer, but is surprisingly thin. It is not a make-or-break for the beer, just an interesting characteristic. ""

Overall: One of my top 10 beers (The old bomber Karbach BBHs, La Fin Du Monde, Avery Reverend, Aventinus, Real Ale Sisyphus, Avery Maharaja, Ranger Creek Wee Heavy, any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon, New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA)

I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer. I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate.

I don't love my favorite beers because they score high on this site. I love them because they are fantastic. This is a fantastic beer.",4.75
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"A: when pored the appearance is as black as can be. This beer is so dark, the foam appears to be a dark brown rather than the the typical white. This appearance is how you know this will be a serious stout.

S: There are definitely notes of bourbon in the aroma. You can also detect notes of roasted barley and oak.

T: The taste of this brew is suburb for an imperial stout. There is a rich blend of flavors from the oak, the bourbon and the malts. While there is also some hop presence, its really the bourbon that takes center stage here. This is definitely the gold standard for a barreled aged beer.

M: The mouth feel is very warming. That is to be expected at with a beer with a big abv like this one. This is definitely something you want to drink in the colder weather,

O: Overall Goose island nailed this style. I don't often give 5 star ratings but this brew earned it. It is such a rich imperial stout that drinks very smoothly. It is one of the best beers I have ever drank. Final rating 5/5.",5.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Goose Island Bourbon County Stout
Live review. Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle.
A: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5
S: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5
T: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5
M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5
D: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening. Intention, in my opinion, is to enjoy one of these in an evening, and frankly share it with someone else. 4.0",4.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"The grandaddy. I've had the 2012 variant most recently on a trip to Chicago. Held up surprisingly well. Still have a 2013 bottle hanging on in the cellar that I can't wait to open. Even ""bad"" variants of the original are so solid, reliable and respectable. Excellent experience every time. Very much looking forward to the 2022 lineup and the 2019 > 2022 vertical I plan on doing at New Year's.",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"2019 vintage:

Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a snifter.

Look- Black, medium brown frothy head, visible particulate near the outside of the glass, average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, toffee.

Taste- Toffee, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, semi sweet.

Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, mouth coating, mouth warming, smooth, creamy.

Overall- Vibrant and well balanced flavors with a full body that coats and warms the mouth. This provided a brilliant drinking experience.",4.75
Bourbon County Brand Stout,I drank the 2017 bottling yesterday. It was amazing! The 5 years of aging smoothed out the taste perfectly.,4.75
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Very first time that I've ever had something like this. The bottle I have is from the 2019 stock.

Poured into a chalice-like glass. Color is a very dark blackish and brown mix. Thick and syrup-like with a noticeable alcohol aroma.

Smell is excellent and to me consists of chocolate, plum, coffee, caramel, vanilla, and of course, Bourbon.

The 14.7 ABV brings a nice, warm taste to the experience and I look forward to my next bottle.

Oh yeah, enjoy it with your friends or the family members and they will thank you for the chance to taste a great stout. I highly recommend this to everyone.",5.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,Bought a flight of years from craft cellar. Astounding!,5.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,This is a great beer and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. At 14.6% its very smooth and makes for a great special occasion beer. The only even slightly negative thing i could say about it is that it may be a slight bit too thick to drink at any time. If i was full i dont know that id enjoy one. In my opinion this beer is so good that i think people are now talking bad about it just to go against the grain and feel like they better than everyone else who likes it.,5.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Not much of a head. Very rich on the nose; bourbon, figs, cola, milk chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is heavy on the bourbon, with figs, honey, and chocolate, followed by roasted malt and coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak come and go. The bourbon really dominates, more than just about any other BA stout I’ve had. Feel is a bit oily, and the alcohol warmth approaches that of a wine.
I understand why it’s a classic. This beer has some kick, but does so without becoming cloying or unbalanced. Not my favorite, but great nonetheless.",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"It's obviously a good stout, but it's just too much for me. Very syrupy, very sweet. You get vivid notes of chocolate and bourbon and toffee yet none of it is enjoyable. It simply has none of what I look for in a beer, or even a stout.",2.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Awesome beer in every way. A true favorite.

L: Dark! Dark and thick as motor oil. Even the short head is caramel in color. It is beautiful!
S: Nice aroma akin to the bourbon barrels in which it was aged. The mixture of malty stout and bourbon is heavenly.
T: This isn't an overly complex stout, and it delivers very well on what it promises. Malt, bourbon, and stout. This isn't too say that nothing else is going on. There are underlying flavors that play well together, and the concert of all the flavors together are well-balanced.
F: Thick and smooth! Matches the look beautifully.
O: I love this beer. I scored it shy of perfect because I want there to be even more of everything I described. But maybe leaving me wanting more is what makes this beer so amazing.",4.75
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Exceptional.

Have had a few bottles, different vintages. Does not disappoint. Definitely a top beer for any special occasion.

The pour was ordinary, no great head.
Nice aroma.
Delicious to drink. Truly outstanding. Flavors come through, but not too much. Smooth and silky. It is on the sweet side, but not quite overbearing, which makes it stand out.

ABV truly hidden.

World Class.",4.75
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"L - 2021 vintage. Shared half of a 16.9 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours opaque black with a 1 finger light tan head. Has significant lacing as well as alcohol legs from the 14% high ABV.

S - Sweet up front. Vanilla. Cola and chocolate. Alcohol. Dark fruit. Raisin or cherry. Some bread scents in the back.

T - Sweet taste as follows scent. Lots of dark fruit (prune, date, raisin) up front. Almost the taste of a port wine. Caramel and vanilla in there. A slight wood or oak. Chocolate notes as well. Love the complexity of each taste providing a little bit different each time. Not boozy even after is warms up some further along like other high ABV beers.

F - Really good medium body mouthfeel. Lower carbonation from and aged Beer. Very smooth and drinkable at high ABV

O - This is a great beer. I know there are a lot of ""flavors"" in this line now, but I tried the base beer of the 2021 batch, and it was World-Class. Well worth picking up and adding to the annual rotation.",4.5

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Delicious stout filled with oak influenced flavors.

Very soft mouthfeel.",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This is my first review on BeerAdvocate!

Pouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.

The first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else.

This is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me.

Still, very good.",4.5
Flora Plum,"Original bottling

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".

Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.

All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.

Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment",4.75
Flora Plum,"After Flora Pear, this is my favorite Flora. Excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer. Pours a beautiful deep gold, big wine nose, effervescent with plums dancing in the background. Fantastic.",4.75
Flora Plum,"Pours a straw gold. Nose of plum, Lemon, hay, and traditional HF nose. Taste follows with a well blended plum, lemon, hay, minimal acid. Feel is light/medium with medium carb. Overall, this is an excellent fruit beer that is well balanced with the base beer.",4.5
Flora Plum,"Alan, I cannot thank you enough for this bottle.

375ml bottle - 2018 vintage - poured into a wide tulip at 44°F.

Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible.

Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular.

Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity.

Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine.

Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead.",4.75
Flora Plum,"Displaying a unique color of lightly foggy pale orange or even crayon peach, a moderately dense white blanket settles down to a curled, quietly active ring.

The nose has faint, mildly dusty oak pairing with a pleasantly subtle floral perfume that's just hypnotizing.

Uniquely and cleanly juicy, a lightly herbal, drupe-influenced sort of pear character with just a kiss of tartness is dreamily weaved throughout the zippy effervescence of its satisfyingly palate massaging medium-light body before coming to a vanishing semi-dry swallow.

Flora Plum is such a perfectly quaffable yet delicately complex brew, it's beyond words. I love being floored by subtly delicate complexity like this. The experience is pure, even without a discernible Hill expression. It seems to even transcend that already high bar.",5.0

Pours a pale pastel yellow with a coarse 0.5 finger white head. Nose is citrus, pear, and apple. All underripe. Actually a bit more muted than I thought it would be. Some cane sugar and starfruit in there as well. Beer opens grapefruit, pear, and apple. An interesting take on the tropical fruit flavor profile. The middle yields notes of citrus, a touch of grassiness, and more pear skin. End is more pear, apple, and citrus fruit. Finish bone dry with an aftertaste of citrus rind. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and foamy in the mouth and aggressive going down. Probably the dryest beer I've had to date. A long, lingering aftertaste.

Headroom,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. This is a really good-looking NEIPA - juicy, milkshake-like burnt yellow with a near-1-finger white head on top.

S: Nose does NOT disappoint - it jumps out of the glass with a bushel of fruit: pineapple, melon, ripe apricot/peach, a touch of lime.

T: Pretty much follows the nose, with pineapple, ripe melon, mango, tangerine, orange creamsicle, then finishing with a lemon-lime bitterness and key lime pie. The 8% ABV is not noted at all, though I think I'm getting a little warmth in the belly.

M: Medium to full-bodied, creamy feel to this one - more creamy than juicy, if that makes sense. Real nice feel to it, challenges Tree House's best in that regard.

O: Phenomenal. A really, really good NEIPA.",4.75
Atrial Rubicite,"2020 vintage (Blend 10/April 2020); consumed on 7/31/2022

Pours a stunningly vivid, blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy, soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.

Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time.

Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close.

Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout.",4.5

Consumed 10/18/20

As with all the best NEDIPAs, this is a beautiful beer. If it didn't taste and smell so amazing, I'd wonder if they made beers just to look pretty on Instagram, but this matches on the other notes. I love that the ones from the Northeast do have a bit more of a bitter dry finish than the Midwestern ones that I drink most often (being from Chicago.) I DO wish they'd change to a 16oz can. There's a reason why that's so popular now as a format size, and with the dryer finish, I could really drink more than 12oz in a sitting. There's not as much on the nose as the super fresh Hop Butcher's that I most often drink, but that might be due to the can being a month old. I still get nice hops and bitter grapefruit rind on the nose and pallet. It's a wonderfully balanced beer. Will HF ever expand and increase distribution? If so, people will undoubtedly say their quality has dropped even if it doesn't. I'd love to see this in my area. Don't ever pass this one up!",4.75

Coconut Vibes,"750ml bottle at share. Inky black pour, ring of beige head. Aroma is coconut, chocolate, roasty, nutty. Taste pronounces the almonds a bit more, with plenty of lush coconut and chocolate flavors to nail the Almond Joy vibe. Superb!",4.75
Coconut Vibes,"This is by far the thickest stout I have ever had, as crazy as that may sound. It’s like darn motor oil! It’s is very tasty, smells great and is well worth being a top 250!",4.75
Coconut Vibes,"Most recent batch poured into a tulip. Motor oil viscosity. Completely opaque. Coats the glass. Tons of dark chocolate and toasted coconut. On the sweeter side but really phenomenal. Super mouth coating. Very thick. Low carb. Overall, this was outstanding. One of the best non ba coconut stouts I’ve ever had.",4.75
Coconut Vibes,Blend #3 version poured from the bottle into a snifter. So happy to be able to try this after getting in trade from another BA. Wonderfully thick with a hint of booze and LOTS of coconut.,4.75
King Sue,"Well-deserved hype for this one. Finally found it relatively fresh, canned 08/18 and consumed 09/22. Super smooth, delicious Citra all the way, and the IBUs hardly noticeable given the balance achieved. Hope I can find its siblings fresh as well.",4.5
King Sue,"Pours a hazy grapefruit yellow with a four finger head that leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma is orange, pineapple and a hint of mango. Taste is lighter than expected, very orange with pineapple mixed in. Nicely bitter but not overly so. There is a slight sweetness to the brew. Nicely done.",4.25
King Sue,It's just so wonderful and drinkable and sniffable and did I say drinkable. IT's great stuff and T Rex on the can is cool beans. My problem is finding it fresh. The store I usually go to has stuff on the shelf that's past the best buy date and I'm not spending 18 bucks on a four pack of 16 ozs. This same store was selling single 16 oz cans of 10 day old King for ten bucks. Perhaps I should talk to the manager.,4.25
King Sue,"King Sue Double IPA by Toppling Goliath. 7.8% ABV 100+ IBUs. This is really interesting…it’s got some bitterness up front and at the end but not nearly what the IBUs would indicate. Nice orange, mango and some pineapple in the middle with a little lemon or grapefruit at the end. Fair amount of carbonation as indicated by the head. Very nice lacing. Not quite the same color as the pictures on the brewery website…more pale golden yellow than the light orange on the website. Really good….",4.5
King Sue,Can. Murky with lasting head and lace. Extremely fruity pineapple and citrus aroma with some raw dough. Medium sweetness buried under the juicy tartness with almost a hint a grain. Doughy full body. Lively carbo stops short of a bite. Juicy juicy juicy. A classic NEDIPA if you like that sort of thing. I don't.,3.0
King Sue,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Smells of bright citrus and floral hops. Tastes of citrus and floral hops, nice flavor. Beer is medium to full bodied yet easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.",4.25
King Sue,"Love this beer
My favorite",5.0
King Sue,Single can from Party Source,4.5
King Sue,"What can I say? Hop onslaught. Hop smoothie. Hopadelic. Hop juice galore. Poured into a snifter at 48F. Looks like straight orange juice with a fluffy white head that lasts forever. Smells like orange juice and white bread. Tastes of orange rind. Thick consistency that is somewhat filling. Alcohol is there, but not outstanding due to the level of hop intensity. Overall 5 across the board. Would recommend this beer to everyone who likes citrus anything.",5.0
King Sue,Best beer I've had.,5.0
King Sue,"Best New England style IPA I have sampled. Smooth, full of flavor and great mouth feel.",5.0
King Sue,"Super hazy/cloudy yellow/orange like pineapple juice with a touch of orange. The head is substantial, retains well and manages some nice lace.
The aroma is grapefruit, pineapple and pine resin with a hint of light caramel malt in the background. The taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of Cara Cara oranges, lemon, apricot, mango and passion fruit, slightly sweet with a light malt background, balanced by plenty of grapefruit pulp and pine resin bitterness. The finish is dry with lingering pine resin and a white pepper note.
The body is full with moderate carbonation, smooth but with a fell of light pulp content even if not visible.
Altogether this is an amazingly tasty and enjoyable brew, everything is balanced for maximum impact that makes the ABV almost unnoticed..",4.5
King Sue,Favorite beer right now.,5.0
King Sue,"On tap at the Irish River in Louisville. The color is like a mix of pineapple juice and grapefruit. And so is the nose. Very smooth hazy IPA. Not an overload of any flavor. Not even too boozy. Such a nice blend of grapefruit, tropical, and hops.",4.25
King Sue,"From Chicago and I've been drinking a lot of the weekly hop butcher which is almost always amazing, Phase 3's dipas, Microphone, Riverlands these stand out too. But over the past few months theyve all been hit or miss. And for $20 a 4 pack it hurts when you miss. Then i came back to an old favorite--Toppling Golliath. its got just about everything i like about all these beers, everything i hope for every time i by the new weekly. BUT HERES THE THING. King Sue has ""it"" every time. Real big fresh hoppy tones (citra) but so fresh, like they use real hops vs canned or dried hops if i had to guess. The pale ale version pseudo sue is just as good.",4.75
King Sue,"Purchased at Pennridge Beverage, Perkasie, PA. $22.50/4pk (16oz cans)

Pours a hazy, golden color. A one finger, white head on the initial pour that fades to a sticky residue on the glass.

Wonderful fruity, lemony aroma.

A citrusy, reiseny, slightly bitter taste. Slightly sweet. Very good IPA.

Medium consistency, medium carbonation.

My first brew from Toppling Goliath and I was impressed. I would definitely seek this out in the future. Cheers!",4.5
King Sue,Had on tap at Glory Beer Bar & Kitchen in Philadelphia. This was a delicious New England-style DIPA with enormous depth of flavor and aroma. One of the best examples I've had of a style that I truly enjoy.,5.0
King Sue,Excellent,5.0
King Sue,"Full disclosure first: I'm usually not a fan of hazy IPAs as they are often too sweet, too murky, and not bitter enough for an IPA. But there are exceptions, and King Sue is certainly a great one. The look: King Sue pours with a beautiful white head that lasts, on top of an unattractive yellowish dishwater look. If you don't mind the murky dirty look, you'll be fine.

The smell is hoppy, classic Citra, with more fruity complexity. The taste is grapefruit and other tropical fruit flavors. It's less tart than some Citra beers. The big plus is that it's got solid bitterness as an integral part of the package. I don't like hazy IPAs that are basically alcoholic fruit juice, but King Sue is a real IPA, with bitterness and a noticeable ABV kick. This beer packs a flavor punch.

The feel is very thick, almost like a fruit smoothie.

Overall, it's certainly the best New England IPA I've had, with a standout flavor profile.",4.25
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Likely the best pale ale I've ever had. Just hits every note - perfect balance, ton of flavor. If I could have this in my beer fridge at all times, I would. It just curb stomps the vast majority of pale ales I've had. Great citrus flavors, nice body. Surprising high ABV for a pale, which probably helps the flavor profile, but I'm not taking that as a detraction - this is a fantastic beverage.",4.5
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Deep orange in color. No head created, at all. Nose was the least desirable quality, mainly due to not much there, especially given the color and extreme citrus taste. Taste is the magical moment. Superb beer. Surprised it is not considered a NE Style though.",4.5
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"2022-03-06
16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14.

Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.

Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty. This is a very good beer.",4.25
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a pale, but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. No floaters.

Smell: Fresh citrus notes. Mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit.

Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness.

Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.

Overall: Full and juicy Pale Ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. Could easily be mistaken for a DIPA. Very challenging compared to other Pale Ales with its full body and its dry finish. Great beer. Very intense.",4.5
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Pours small head. Disappears into a juice like substance. Classic trillium. They sucks with head.
That’s ok tho because the beer has a great pineapple grapefruit oniony nose.
Flavor is bitter on the front and nice grapefruit and pineapple on the back.
Really delicious. I like the bitterness. Something a lot of northeast IPAs don’t have.
Really good pale overall.",4.25
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Yellow, just slightly less bright than orange juice, and totally opaque. White, very soapy head, dissipates rather quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Sweet, sticky, dank, mango, ripe, pineapple smell, a bit of smarties. Taste follows, just dank, hoppy, herbaceous, grassy, fruity, sticky, berries. Clean mouthfeel, and a floral aftertaste.",4.25
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"draught
Cloudy, medium orange, with some yellow/gold highlights, for the look. Very fruity, tangelo peel and some grapefruit peel, in the aroma. Rather thin bodied & tasting. The flavors are mainly, mixed citrus peel, with just barely enough, medium light, toasted malt, to give it any body whatsoever. So-so.",3.5
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"#65, yummy!",5.0
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,Had it at trillium brewing in Boston near Fenway.,4.25
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,More like an IPA than pale ale. Hoppy and delicious,4.5
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Haven't had a straight up ""pale ale"" this good in a while. Really packs a wallop. It has that NE style to it customary to all Trillium ales. Very impressive.",4.0
Society & Solitude #4,"Canned 8/02/22.

L: Pours a hazy but not opaque deep orange-gold with a beautiful thick and sticky head. Splotchy lacing.

S: Orange and tangerine aroma. A little peach.

T: Citrus up front, beautifully transitioning to a smooth fruity middle. Finishes slightly dry with just a touch of bitterness.

F: Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation.

O: A wonderfully flavorful beer. Lots going on here, but it never gets muddled or overpowering.",4.75
Society & Solitude #4,"That pour is a deep, foggy orange with a 3 cm foam cap and an aroma of orange zest.
The flavor is full with orange, mango and woody hop notes.
The mouthfeel is soft and the flavors persist. This is superb.",4.5
Society & Solitude #4,"Just a banger of an IPA - very refined - very balanced; no real hint of overpowering bitterness. Just a smooth clean, clean, flavorful hop bite that makes these far too easy to drink at 8%. Which isn't a bad thing. Great beer.",4.5
Society & Solitude #4,"I’ve been fortunate to have tried some of the best ipas. This #4 is truly refined, smooth. Perfect for a toast! I count myself lucky to have neighbors who care enough to bring me a can or two, or 8. Alas, they will be moving on to greener grass. So glad to have met you all.",5.0
Society & Solitude #4,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a full and hazy yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a while leaving a good amount of lacing. A few floaters are visible.

Smell: Soft notes of orange, tangerine, mango and lychee.

Taste: Citrusy body with hints of orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Medium fruity sweetness paired with a lightly tingling zesty bitterness and a marzipan-like finish.

Feel: Juicy, smooth and very silky. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Beautifully crafted DIPA with a soft and fruity aroma, a complex yet nicely balanced taste, and a lovely mouthfeel. This is a great beer and a joy to drink.",4.75
Society & Solitude #4,"Cloudy, darker gold. Excellent streaks and spots for lace from the moderate head.

Unsweetened malt with peaches and fruit punch on the initial smell. There's a touch of alcohol aroma. The dominating nose is black pepper.

Berry up front with a moderate sweetness. Fuller body with muted carbonation. The alcohol present subtly throughout the tasting. The finish, while bitter, comes on slowly and never overwhelms. The aftertaste is long and more dry.",4.0
Society & Solitude #4,Tried with Tim,4.5
Society & Solitude #4,Can thanks to jeffreed61.,3.75
Society & Solitude #4,"Pours a very pretty and bright pale with the slights shades of orange/gold. It is very cloudy but it is not murky, it looks so in the picture but the edges have a slight clarity to them. Perfectly white creamy looking head, some generous lacing with almost every sip.

The smell is so so lively, like bursting out of the glass. Super pungent peach, citrus, also hints of tropical fruits.

The taste follows the nose mainly in the same peachy citrus I first got from the nose. There’s also a nice grassiness that I didn’t pick up on in the nose along with the slightest touch of herbal green flowers.

This beer has a medium body but it is such a soft and pleasant beer to drink. Semi dry finish with a medium bitterness that goes down so smooth and clean.",4.5
Society & Solitude #4,Used to get all the HF ipas disturbed near me. This was pretty standard. Nothing excpetional,4.25

Lou Pepe - Framboise,Enjoyed this in Brussels. Love raspberry and the Lambic balance was excellent. The beer is relatively acidic to the mouth so be prepared. Love this as a desert .,4.5
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750 ml corked and capped bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Made with 300 g of raspberries per liter beer. Clear signal red colour, moderate pink head. Intense aroma of raspberries (no surprise). The flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries, fairly dry and crisp.",3.5
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2015 vintage. Tart raspberries with typical funk. Had the 2012 Kriek and the 2013 side by side. The kriek was a touch superior, followed closely by the framboise.",4.75
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Today our fence is being repaired after a Tornado ripped through the neighborhood almost three weeks ago, so I am celebrating by drinking Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise (2015). It was among the best Lambics that I've ever had.

Look: dark red with an inch thick off-white head

Aroma: raspberry, white wine.

Taste: The flavor is tart raspberry, lots of raspberry, lemon, oak, white wine, and there's a very long and pleasant tart and dry raspberry after taste.

Body/Overall: medium body",4.75
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750ml bottle at share. Ruby colored pour, head is a light pink. Raspberrries. Period. Huge berry aroma and taste, normal lambic funk. Slight barrel eleemnts. Great stuff.",4.5
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Beautiful red slightly pinkish color with a thin head.
Sour aroma with notes of raspberries, horse mantle, lemon drops and nice funkiness.
Flavor with notes of lemon sourness, raspberries, white wine, mild sulfur, lactic acid and oak. Dry aftertaste with practically no residual sugar.
Light body with mild carbonation. It is not flat as in Lambic.
This is how a Fruit Lambic should be. No sugar residues with the raspberries fruitiness that is an extension of the natural Lambic flavors.",4.25
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar.

Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus. The soft fluffy body comes across as a bit more delicate than Gambrinus, and a little less sour. The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it.",4.5
Abricot Du Fermier,"Appearance - The beer was the color of an apricot. It was golden orange with some red hues. Carbonation was visible.

Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison.

Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.

Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.

Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this.",4.5
Abricot Du Fermier,"Pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency. Transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head never forms. Aroma is apricot right off the cuff, although it's mild and nuanced into the profile. Stone, lemongrass, and earth add some more depth. It has a pleasant tartness to it, leaning into a little acidity. Flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch, especially when served at fridge temperature. The acidity wanes as the beer warms. Apricot adds some sweetness, and is more forward than the nose, taking up a more dominate role. It's still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. Cellar stone, earthy malts, grass, and lemon zest create the rest of the profile, all accompanied by some minor tartness. Mouth feel is still in effervescence, delivering a smooth texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle. Blend #5.",4.5
Abricot Du Fermier,"Truly excellent beer. Not too funky, but plenty of saison characteristics. Pleasant apricot flavor. Dry finish. Aging in wine barrels gives it a subtle booziness.",4.75

Cable Car,"2016 poured from fridge on 5/20/21

Pours a clean straw. Nose of white wine, somewhat jammy (cherry, strawberry?), Funk and barnyard, and honey as it warms. Taste of funk, jammy characteristics, vinous. Feel is light with medium carb. Overall, wow! What an excellent wild and held up very well.",4.5

White wine and white grapes.

The taste is All sour, fresh but light lacto with Cantillion like oak and dusty cellar. Continues with fresh harvested apples and white grapes.

Oude Geuze Vintage,Delicious,4.5
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Lightly foggy burnt orange to amber, nearly glowing, with a tall off-white foam head settling to unevenly airy, bubbly lumps that are somewhat translucent, translating more to a khaki hue, leaving tiny spots of lace on the glass.

Smell is both more oaky and peppery than regularly OG, a little dusty even, but also brighter and spicier, in a pleasant, sense-awakening way. Adding to the allure are hints of dried, gooey apricot, fresh fig and white grape.

The medium body's lively effervescence perks up the palate, again with surprisingly bright, zippy characteristics. It's super refreshing and also very pleasantly balanced on the palate, quaffable to a frightening degree, particularly for a bottle so hard to find.

It's like a mimosa with white grape juice instead of orange, while very fine white oak adds complementary complexity without any undesirable features, and barely a touch of funk. Again here it's more peppery, yet not as toasty as regular OG, but it simultaneously gives a feel like you can crunch down on it before the frothy light carbonation dies into a perfectly clean, semi-dry swallow. It consistently reminds me of nelson, my favorite hop.

Absolutely scrumptious, with an unbelievable mouthfeel.",5.0

Aroma is hop forward with earth and malt overtone that also offer some floral notes. Taste is bitter throughout with a slightly citrusy sweet finish that lingers. Mouth is chewy and flavorful, very satisfying. A little dark and hoppy for a pale ale, but oh sooo good! In fact it was so good I had to go back to where I got it and buy the remaining 2 six packs.

Smell: Strong aromas of grapefruit and citrus. It also has some support pineapple notes.

Taste: It has grapefruit flavors with some pineapple and mango. There is a bit of sweetness in the flavor. There are low background caramel notes.

Feel: It has a medium body and good bitterness to it without being sharp.

Overall: An excellent pale ale with plenty of flavor and bitterness.",4.5
Zombie Dust,Not as biter as I thought it would. Not as bitter as bells two hearted either. Great liquid that goes down easy but still taste like an ipa. Malt and medium bitterness with a light body. Would buy again as a 6 pack for a campfire or something.,4.25
Zombie Dust,"Hazy, light amber color. Moderate bar pitted head which lasts throughout the tasting. Slippery lace leaving a minimum of streaks as the beer is consumed.

The aroma starts with a sweetness that reminds me of papaya and guava (in a word, tropical). The hop is mostly floral with a bit of black pepper thrown in.

The malt is dryer than I expected, certainly less tropical than the smell. The hop is more pronounced producing a bitter bite. The body is neutral as is the carbonation. Long bitter aftertaste.",4.25

Zombie Dust,"Acquired in a trade with @Turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in June 2022.

Look: Pours a burnished, bright orange, with a white, persistent head. Leaves lacing on the glass as it goes down.

Nose: Oh yeah! Big, bitter hops, clean orange citrus, caramel malt. This is a throwback to the good old days!

Taste: Even better than the nose! It has a big bitter hop burn that's awesomely bracing. Flavour wise there's a dank resinous note that gives way to clean orange and pineapple citrus. The finish is uber clean.

Mouth: It's like chewing a beer - you know it's in your mouth and it doesn't disappoint. There's high carbonation that leaves a lot of carbonic prickling on the tongue and in the throat, and on the swallow there's a warning kick, presumably from the hops. Awesome.

Overall: This is a fantastic throwback to an old-school, big, bitter, citrusy pale ale. Great beer!

Cheers!",4.5
Zombie Dust,"Not worth the high rating in my opinion. Tasted very much like a normal IPA. Rich orange color with citrus and strong hoppy aromas. Nothing different from what I’d expect from a regular IPA. Feels and tastes of a heavy malt with a smooth finish. The smoothness clearly gives it the edge, but outside of that not a 100 rated beer. On the positive side, double thumbs up for the artwork on the can! The Zombie King coming right out of a graphic novel gets a hard 5/5, but the beer gets a slightly above average rating.",4.25

More to come. Will revisit. 07/19/22 Now my third of 6 Zombie Dust beers. The second one tasted much better than the first. Something was not right about it. These last two taste phenomenally better. So much smoother and doesn’t taste like uniced tea. Changed my rating to reflect that. Now has a bit of sweetness that lingers and I find that exceptional. Really good beer.",4.5

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2018 vintage

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still",4.25
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 ""Amalie Arena"" edition...large capped bottle.

Pours very dark with no light shining through, next to no cap or lacing.

Dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.

Super smooth, nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2018 Vintage

750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!

Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75

Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25

Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0

Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25

Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75",3.75
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time.",3.75
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Look - fantastic black and thick with a great lasting tan head and rimming

Feel - medium body light carb with a slight cream

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Had this in August, then the 2016 version, + have tasted a few vintages before. Incredible solid imperial stout from the Floridian masters here! Super RIS",4.5
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.

2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick.",4.5
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking. I'm grateful to finally drink this white whale.",4.5

Notes via stream of consciousness: A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden/brass colored body. The head appears to be holding quite well. The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit, nectarine, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange, pineapple, juicy apple, and distant lemon/lime. The malt is basic, most likely with 2-row, wheat, and oats although I can't specifically taste the wheat or oats. A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue. It's fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins. The head held up really well and it's left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass. All in all I don't think that Green is Treehouse's best beer by any stretch but it's a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Green,"Gorgeous pastel body; yellow-orange appearance; huge head, dense and creamy texture, rocky and white. Peach, pineapple and mango aroma; faint notes of oats and biscuit. Citrus-forward flavor with a sharp, phenol and alcohol bitterness; biscuit-like malt undertone. Heavy body; velvety; juiciness cut with a strong boozy dryness.

If you like New England style India pale ales and sharp, spiky bitterness, this is the beer for you.

Green,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy yellowish orange with a foamy white head leaving a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

Smell: Fresh citrus fruits. Mainly orange and tangerine. Hints of mango and pineapple.

Taste: Also orange, tangerine, mango and pineapple. White grapes and lime are there, too. Low sweetness, medium bitterness.

Feel: Smooth and juicy. Very dry finish.

Overall: With Very Green and Very Gggreennn being two of my absolute favorites from Tree House, I was a bit disappointed by this one. No question it's a great beer, but I was just expecting more of the complexity of its siblings. However, it's a fresh and crushable beer and drinks very smoothly.",4.25
Green,"Hazy shades of yellow with a finger of white foam and lacing abounding. Dank and piney hops give off a cornucopia of fruits: clementine, grapefruit, lime, mango and guava. Taste has powerful bitterness from the pine forward hops, citrus pith, pineapple rind, lime, and melon rind. Feel has mild oxidation with the intense hops, mild juiciness is pleasant and cooling, body is a little thin. A good hop bomb, but not the 63rd best beer in the world",4.25
Green,"The can pour is an opaque yellow-orange with a 3 cm white foam cap and a fruity nose punch. Orange, mango are most prominent. The flavor follows the nose with those fruits over malt. The hop flavors persist as waves. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth.
This one is great.",4.5
Green,"Milkshake cloudy with a lighter gold color. Moderate sized head which recedes slowly and in a rocky fashion. Fine lacing that nearly coats the glass.

Strong weedy aroma, reminiscent of freshly grounded hop cones. Mild alcohol in the back.

This fits into the extreme category. The flavor is quickly dominated by a total hop explosion, The biting sensation lasts through the long aftertaste. The body and carbonation are in the average range. Overall, this beer does what it wishes to do well, but it's outside of my comfort zone.",4.0

Green,"can into glass
Bought at brewery.
Canned 8 days prior to review.
Quite frothy, quickly dissipating, white head. Fairly murky, medium orange with some amber overtones, to the look. Mango, guava, candied tangelo peel, a little medium roast caramel malt, emerges out of the mix. Seems like there is a whiff of some nutmeg/allspice, or such, buried deep in the aroma. A nice melange of some Mandarin orange peel, a bit of medium light toasted malt, underlying, and a whiff of guava/passion fruit, deep in the taste somewhere. There is some lightness to this beer and it finishes mainly with a little tingly, glowing, Mandarin orange/tangelo peel bite. Definitely well done.",4.25
Green,"Depp color reminds me of fresh orange juice. Head is very white that allows lacing to caress the glass. The nose is everything the can describes, juicy, sorbet, tangerine.

Green,"Appearance -The beer poured a cloudy orange-yellow color with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The typical nose of orange/tangerines was present.

Taste - The profile was loaded with green spicy hops. The citrus notes brought oranges to mind with just a bit of spice. I did not get pineapple as others did, though I searched hard. A overall gritty nature was noted.

Mouthfeel - Viscosity allowed the profile to link with peppery notes clinging tightest.

Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of off-white rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base. The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit, nectarine, apricot, and mango. The malt is delicately sweetish, bready, and lightly oat-like. The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity. In the mouth it's medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It's smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge. The head has held up really well and I've still got a creamy, but more importanty complete, surface covering. The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories. The aroma is better on their ""Very Hazy"", and I've scored it better overall, but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version.
Review #7,975",4.5
Haze,"Lovely golden orange body; cloudy; thick head, white and sculpted and long lasting. An interesting aroma; like a sage / cucumber mix; faint bit of citrus. The taste follows along the lines of the smell; stronger sense of cucumber rind bitterness; biscuit-like malt flavor. Heavy body; moderate acidity; somewhat juicy, somewhat dry on the palate.

All I can say is the smell and taste are weird. I don't recall tasting anything like this. If there is supposed to be a stronger citrus presence, it's missing in this sample. If anything, the hop profile seems like some weird combination of Motueka and Nelson Savin hops. Motueka has never thrilled me, but Nelson Savin can be very interesting. Still, there must be a reason it (currently) has a 100 score on BA, but I certainly don't understand it.

My goodness, what a delicious liquid. Massive citrus nose with grapefruit notes and several other tropical flavors. Taking one of these down after a few runs was an absolute dream. Refreshing and smooth. And, yes, I brought a glass for the tailgate. Veteran move.",4.5
Haze,"Impressive dome head which never recedes completely. Excellent lacing with a variety of streaks and spots. The liquid is cloudy with a dirty gold appearance.

Grapefruit rind aroma along with some green vegetal/fresh cut grass notes. The malt is hard to tease out, but I would say it's closest to light wheat bread.

There's a berry sweetness up front. Richer body with a neutral level of carbonation. The hop is pronounced but not overwhelming. It's closer to black pepper with a notable alcohol warmth in the swallow. The sweetness returns in the aftertaste, but dissipates first leaving the peppery finish.",4.25

Murky darker yellow hazy body with a huge white head, spotted lacing. Big grapefruit and citrus with light pineapple lead the nose. Taste is much the same, some tangerine additions are nice. Body is medium-light with decent brightness and smoothness, not the most lush neipa ever. Does hide the abv very well",4.25

Significant barrel spice and heat are right up front before the thick body envelopes the palate with maple, coconut, and mocha brownies. The finish actually cleans up and even becomes somewhat crisp to a semi-dry, tingly and only slightly sticky lip smacking swallow.

The barrel is significant here. Mature, spicy, peppery, and lightly charred with a caramel and even spiced rum character to it. This compliments the maple well, while tempering the decadence of the mocha, vanilla and coconut, which is like a swirling creme anglaise throughout.",4.25

This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego, which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet, so I can't draw any comparisons there. However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit

Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together

Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange rind, mango, papaya and peach - sweet but not overly so. A nice bitterness on the back end cuts that sweetness down and balances it out a bit.

The taste is surprisingly bitter with heavy notes of grapefruit pith. Minimally sour but still has that lambic funk with a cider quality and mild lactic acidity. The mouthfeel is light bodied with mild acidity. Its actually not harsh on the palate, quite easy to drink.

Overall: its a great beer. Not as complex as I expected, but its simplicity is not a bad thing. Its quite similar to to FFG Last Four Winters in Wisconsin and New Glarus Vintage series. It would be fun to have them all side by side.",4.25
The Broken Truck,"7 February 2021 - Beer #227 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade
Rank: #86 on Beer Advocate

Appearance: 5 - looks a bit like apple juice. It's as clear as can be with a lovely, fluffy white head.

Nose: 4 - smells just like The Lily. White wine. EXTREMELY funky.

Taste: 4 - weird, it's actually kind of bitter. It's very sout, but it's got this vinegary quality to it. Good, but not amazing. Like a fine gueuze.

Mouth: 5 - bubbles galore. Impressive how it doesn't feel overly carbonated despite the bubbles.

Overall: 4 - tasty, well made, but odd.

Cheers!",4.0
The Broken Truck,"Really awesome and complex offering from De Garde. As a member, this beer is one of the ones I most look forward to each and every year. Absolutely worth seeking out.",4.5
The Broken Truck,"Bottle, blend 3, purchased at The Tin Bucket.

A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present.

The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like.",4.75
Triple Shot,"Canned 2/2022. I'm pleasantly surprised by how sweet this isn't, just a hint of rich semi-sweet chocolate at finish. The nutty, roasty base makes for a wonderful coffee showcase throughout.",4.5
Triple Shot,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile.

Taste - Overall, this was like espresso with a huge body. There were notes of fresh roasted coffee, fudge, chocolate ice cream, and just a hint of vanilla. The sweetness came out more in the finish. In the big picture, it was an assault of espresso.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a nice thick clingy body. It allowed the bitterness to linger.

Overall - This was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee. Finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge.",4.5
Triple Shot,"Nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about—water, slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffee.but it tastes fantastic: deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout. Cheers.",4.5
Triple Shot,"House Blend, consumed 6/12/21
Pours incredibly thick for a non-BA stout, great feel. Sweet with a Big Chocolatey roasted coffee smell and taste. Definitely a “dessert” beer, and one that’s meant to be shared. Definitely a treat though, and probably one of the best non-BA stout I’ve had.",4.5
Medianoche - Coconut,"Bless my friends at Tavour for delivering this to my door (eventually). Imbibed a few samples at a local beer festival this spring & happy to finally have it from a bottle on my comfortable couch. Split with my stout-guzzling wife.

Black. After a brief, wispy, half-bald head rises on the pour, it’s 100% gone two minutes later, looking still & sinister. A beer to drown your enemies in (but what a waste…maybe drown your friends?). The nose is coconut & endless malts.

Medianoche – Coconut is thicker than my Sunday waffle batter. Borderline gummy chewable. Taste-wise it’s a simpler beer than I expected. I scoffed at the ‘brownie batter’ description but it’s on the mark & right up front. Well, batter with a shot of bourbon mixed in right after the eggs. Extended cut of coconut, pinch of brown sugar, serious malty sweetness throughout. Given a 10:30 AM wakeup time & a couple hours I’d love to take one of these solo.

Just what I expect from this line of stouts. Thick, sweet, heavy barrel, delicious. Excellent beer.",4.0
Medianoche - Coconut,"Thick and viscous like oil; impenetrable black body; no head but a bit of percolating carbonation; flat; sediment flecks tread along the top of the beer. Rich aroma; dark chocolate and roasted coffee; coconut. Enormous flavors of milk chocolate, fudge; coconut and bourbon; faint maraschino cherry and peppermint suggestion; subliminal earthy spiciness in the background. Dense, sludgy mouthfeel; heavy slipperiness; incredible residual sugar presence; syrupy; low-level alcohol warmth in the background.

What hath these brewer's created? Sure, a rather dark and dull appearance but the smell characteristics pick things up. Then, you come to the taste and mouthfeel. Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! What an awe-inspiring experience. The depth, richness and complexity are nearly out of this world. A beer one needs to experience to fully appreciate what mere words struggle to convey.

Pouring temperature: 61.7% ℉; bottling data: 2022 release",4.5
Medianoche - Coconut,"2022 version poured from a 500ML bottle into a snifter. Pours very dark resembling motor oil. Very thick, which I enjoy. Solid coconut flavor that isn't over the top sweet but drinking more than a 500ml bottle would be a challenge.",4.5
Medianoche - Coconut,"500ml bottle from Tavour. Slow, thick pour, black as midnight, no head at all.

Medianoche - Coconut,"No vintage or ABV info on the bottle, but this is the aged Blanton's barrels for 21-24 months version. This looks and feels like stout gravy, I mean this is gelatinous. I can't quite decide if this is too much of a good thing or not. Does anyone else wonder if brewers add corn starch to some of these thicker beers? Weirdly, what few bubbles I could coax from a vigorous pour seemed to exist under the surface.

This is massively, absurdly flavorful. I can't pick all that much out of this, just heaps of bittersweet chocolate and coconut for the most part. I do get a little bourbon but no barrel character otherwise. Very enjoyable.

Edit, there was a weird 2 in long lump at the bottom of my glass. Gross, lowering some scores.",3.5
Medianoche - Coconut,"2021 version aged in Blanton’s. Crazy thickness just sticks to the glass. Anchorage Blessed thick. Shiny film on top let’s you know there’s a bunch of fresh coconut. Nose is heavy dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, coconut. First sips are a shot of motor oil with all those flavors. The Blanton’s brings a darkness to the already heavy malt stout. There’s a tiny hint of bourbon bite, but cut by the coconut sweetness. Definitely a sipper with this viscosity. No noticeable carbonation, just still black goodness. Fortunate to have gotten this by Tavour.

Honestly, Thin Man’s Recent Blanton’s BA Coconut Jenkins gives this a run for its money. Their’s is a little brighter, a little less viscous, but on par IMO.",5.0
Medianoche - Coconut,"This is a special beer.

Pours deep, deep black and very oily thick with absolutely no carbonation and no head whatsoever. At the end of my pour, a thin sheen of copper colored beer glistened on the top. The smell is incredible -- the bourbon barrel comes through strongly with notes of chocolate, cinnamon and coconut. The taste is rich, deeply, deeply chocolate with cinnamon, vanilla notes and coconut as well. There is a strong resemblence to brownies laced with alcohol as well as to a rich creme brulee. A noteworthy taste extravaganza.",4.75
Medianoche - Coconut,"The coffee-coconut was one of my beers of the year last year, from that point onward wanted to try this one. Viscous black body with a short lived brown cap. Nose is laced with bourbon backed dark chocolate with coconut, vanilla, brownie batter, with undercurrents of molasses, roasted malt, oak, and a kiss of cinnamon. Taste is much the same with the huge chocolate, bourbon, coconut and gourmet vanilla, but I find the coffee not being there to cut the sweetness over time hurts this one. This is especially true in the feel, where the heavy, thick, boozy, and massive mouthfeel doesn't do anything to stop sweetness from building. Still a great stout, but the sweetness does add up over time, share the bottle",4.5
Medianoche - Coconut,"Look - black thick syrup with fantastic lacing, no real head or rimming though
Smell - sweet coconut chocolate and booze
Taste - chocolate coconut vanilla and lots of Barrel
Feel - very thick creamy very light carb
Overall - rally fantastic until you get a slug. Had 3 slugs and that was not pleasant",4.5
Medianoche - Coconut,"2022 bottle. Pours mega thick. Completely opaque. Cannot see through it at all. Very minimal mocha head. Aroma is milk chocolate and subtle coconut. Flavor is same as aroma…huge milk chocolate and more coconut in the finish. Sweet but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is insane. This coats everything. Mouth and glass coating. Insanely thick. Overall, a treat to drink. Was a bit much to solo the bottle. Better to share.",4.5

Appearance: Hazy gold with particles, good head.

Smell: Strong grapefruit.

L---Cloudy, but not impenetrable. Orangey amber color. Medium sized fizzy white head faded slowly and left good lacing.

S---Sweet & fruity. Orange, pineapple, mango. Floral notes.

T---Follows the nose, but not as strong. Floral & fruity flavors abound.

F---Dry & crisp. Kind of red wine like.

O---An excellent one. If I knew how good it is, I would've bought more than one.",4.25
Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a marvelous DIPA!!!! As good as any I have tried. Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass this beer featured a medium sized bubbly white head that fades pretty quickly and plenty of lacing on the glass. Beautiful, almost clear, orange/light copper color. Aroma and taste are wonderful. Like Heady Topper, the aroma bursts out the second you open the can - mostly floral hops and some tropical fruit. The taste features floral hops as well but there is more piney hops than the nose would indicate. There is some balance with rye or sourdough bready malt but hops rule here. There is a strong and welcome bitterness to this beer - more complex than a simple hop bomb - but bitter enough to satisfy any hophead. Mouthfeel is bitter, crisp and features a richness associated with the malt. Easily one of the best beers I have ever experienced.",4.5

Sip Of Sunshine,"very floral, definitely need to try a fresher can. Edit: drank 2 weeks fresh and the floral and piney hops shine with a beautiful and sticky-sweet harmony (compared to a 5 month-old can), only to be reined in by caramel and bready malts. Lingering aftertaste. 93/100.",4.25
Sip Of Sunshine,Sip of sunshine is a very consistent and very good double IPA. It drinks almost like a session IPA so smooth and mellow. You can have all your fancy smancy IPAs but this is consistently a great IPA,4.5
Sip Of Sunshine,"My last Sip of Sunshine I brought back from Smuggler's Notch. Such a tremendous IPA! Has a wonderful aroma of hops and tropical fruit. Taste is tropical, fruity, & lupulin hoppiness. This is a top level brew that should be sold & enjoyed in Florida. LOL! I wish.",5.0
Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous transparent orange with plenty of white head. Tons of lacing after the head recedes. Tiny bubbles throughout the glass that persist. Looks fantastic!

The nose is incredible. Oranges, apple pie, mango, pineapple, grass, a touch of honey, and a really nice hoppy layer at the end. This is definitely a wonderful tropical fruit nose. Juicy.

The taste nicely follows the nose. Tropical fruit is definitely there on impact, but nothing like the nose. The middle region and aftertaste are clearly bitter hops. Dank. Citrus peel. Leather, sourdough bread, and a strong earthy note.

Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Love it.",4.25

Enticing aroma; soft earthy, fruity sweetness; orange and mango; light malt presence in the background.

L: Pours a hazy deep gold with a big white head that quickly thins, except around the glass. Light, irregular lacing.

S: All kinds of citrus and floral aromas, with a touch of weedy dankness.

T: Outstanding hop character. Grapefruit up front, then melds into a delightfully tropical medley of mango, pineapple and cantaloupe. Pivots to a dry and slightly bitter finish.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Smooth on the palate. Medium carbonation.

O: The freshness of this four-day-old beer made for some incredible aromas and flavors. Extremely enjoyable.",4.5
Focal Banger,"Canned 7/26/22

Holy shit, I’ve finally found a fresh Alchemist drop nearby, and I wasn’t even actively looking. My local store managed to get some of this and Heady Topper. I got a few cans of each (HT is ready for a re-review, and I couldn’t be more psyched on it. Let’s see what this legendary beer is all about

Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

This is super juicy in the nose, but also shows and incredible balance. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, bready malt, mango juice, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple juice, and light weed

While it’s very good in taste, it doesn’t carry that same balance displayed in the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, orange zest, doughy malt, lemon zest, grassy hops, and light pineapple. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, bready malt, caramel, pineapple juice, grapefruit zest, peppery hops, and light weed

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with with a nice blend of fruit juice and weed

Well, the taste may have been a bit of a letdown, but overall this is a killer beer. I can’t wait to try more from The Alchemist",4.5
Focal Banger,"Would argue that this is in fact better than Heady Topper. The tropical nature and just dankness of the hops shines through even more. Where Heady Topper feels like I’m drinking hop resin, Focal Banger feels like I’m drinking fruit juice with a tinge of hops.",5.0
Focal Banger,"Look: Pale yellow and cloudy with a quick-forming head that settles to a lid and holds, leaving nice ripples of lacing clinging to the edges of the glass
Aroma: Blueberries, mango, grapefruit, passionfruit, pine needles, peach, mandarins, raspberries, sweet bready malt, and some Cannabis
Taste: The palate assault begins with pithy citrus, pine sap, and ripe blueberries that immediately expand their breadth and depth. Soon after, Cannabis, tropical fruit, orange-led citrus, and raspberries start to catch up and mix with the initial hop notes and all happening upon a soft, sweet malt base. Slick hop oils and alpha acids come in waves throughout and closes with a bold bite, pine, and dank
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, medium-high carbonation, and medium strength dryness on the finish
Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. Having had this gem and it’s bigger, bolder cousin (Heady) both for the first time in the last week, I can say not only have I been blown away by both, but I would immediately be a convert to the NE-Style/hazy IPA if all of them were like this O.G. Such a great and almost unbelievably deep nose along with tons of flavor depth, some slickness, a bold bite, and dryness are all prominent here and everything I feel many iterations lack more often than not. I now understand the hype of this sub-style where it originated as well as realizing how many times that I’ve heard how good this beer is and now can finally say, I wholeheartedly agree",4.5
Focal Banger,"My buddy bought me a four pack each of HT And Focal Banger. This was by far my favorite.

Pours a murky gold color with a beautiful fluffy white marshmallow head. Tremendous lacing.

The aroma is pure hop goodness. The flavor and taste on this one is out of this world outstanding. Peach and pine and grapefruit with no sweetness. A true west coast IPA.

Outside of Pliny this is my fave IPA in the world. Fantastic! Thanks Harris!!",5.0
Focal Banger,"16oz can

Pours three massive fingers of supremely fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is superb, after a few minutes all of the head is still here. Initial lacing looks great. Body is a cloudy yellow, reminiscent of a Witbier. Looks perfect so far.

Nose is soft tropical fruit, mandarin oranges, small dankness. There is a perceived sweetness, likely from the fruit. This smells good, elegant, I hope the fruit isn't too candi-like.

The dankness and fruit balance each other wonderfully on the flavor, with neither being overwhelming. Fruit is mostly soft - mandarin oranges, finishes with a citrus rind bite.

Carbonation is medium-low, a small hop bite adds some character. Body drinks relatively light, which is a welcome characteristic. Bitterness is medium-low. Sweetness mostly comes from the fruit, and isn't cloying. Overall a pretty classic mouthfeel for a classic hazy.

Drinkability is pretty high. It's not cloying, or too bitter.

Appearance turned out wonderful. Lacing was thick all the way down, and a small island of foam remained till the end.

Overall a solid classic. Balanced and flavorful.",4.25

The Alchemist
New England IPA
ABV: 7%
Date: 05/03/2022
I was given this beer by one of my good friends. I have already consumed a few; they are tasty. Served in a tulip glass at around 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head with above-average retention. The head is bright white, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color is pale straw with hues of light gold, charting beer around SRM 4. This beer is hazy, and little yeasty friends are just floating around. The appearance of the beer is above average.
Tangerines, lightly floral, with hints of pineapple, pears, and peaches, are the hops aromas. The malt profile is lightly toasted bread crust, cereal grains, and a touch of crackers. Other aromas are grass, wet dew, and yeasty.
The hop profile is the star of this beer. The hops flavors I taste are tangerine, a hint of pine, a touch of orange peel, pineapple, mango, pears, some floral, and a touch of passionfruit. The malt body is light yet stiff enough to hold the hops in check. Other flavors I detect are lightly toasted bread crust, crackers, a hint of minerals, a touch phenolic, and grassy.
The mouthfeel is dry and crisp with medium carbonation. The body is medium, and it finishes tannic and long.
An amazing beer! When I drink NEIPA, this is the standard which I hold other beer. Now I am talking about the balance, flavor profile, and a deft hand in creating this work of art. I wished I lived closer to this brewery, I would have a constant stock of their beer in my fridge.",4.75
Focal Banger,"Heady Topper's little brother!!! Less alcohol presence but just as impressive!!! Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass (I know what it says on the can, but I like looking at my beer!!!) , this beer features a very pale yellow hazy color with a good size foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Head retention is good. Aroma and taste remind me of Heady Topper in that the aroma cascade out of the can as soon as you open it!!! Lots of grapefruit and pine in the nose and taste. More pronounced ""dankness"" than Heady Topper and I detected kind of a mild tobacco taste that I did not detect in Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is rich, bitter and crisp. A great beer!!!!",4.25

Smell: mostly stuck in the can

Taste: a little creamy, a little piney, a little grapefruit, good balance.

Feel: Not as ""plush"" as some more recent beers, but not thin either. Just right for the taste.

Taste follows the nose with notes of weedy hops, dank notes, wood, and some light orange and citrus notes. There is a noticeable malt backbone to the beer. Feel is light, smooth and oddly refreshing in a way.

Citra,"Appearance - The beer poured a rusty yellow color with a visible carbonation and a white head.

Smell - Citrus came though in the nose with a little bit of sweetness.

Taste - With a full body, the citra hops needed to be bold. In fact, they were bold. Unlike most citra hopped beers, this one leaned more bitter. It was dank, with notes of guava and lemon. The finish was warm and a bit of spice.

Mouthfeel - This was not a light beer. It had serious viscosity for the style with notable carbonation.

Overall - Citra hops went in a bit different direction in this beer. I liked it.",4.5

Citra,"Gold steering toward brown, white foam.

Face full of citra hops.

Not the east coast fruit bomb, this has a domineering earthy bent. Something close to cumin with more than notes of tangy pineapple and, much more so on the finish, orange.

Citra,"Canned on 11/11/21; consumed on 11/19/21

Pours a foggy, bronze-tinted, rusty orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; good head retention leaves a finger of rich, creamy cap, equally rich collar lining the surface, and thick layers of webby lacing and spotty accessories spread across the entirety of the glass.

Aroma features flaky malts introducing a softer pineapple into mango flesh and a resinous grapefruit interlude sparking a peaking bouquet, whereon transitional pine to fresh-cut grass on the back end remains synchronized to a peppery dank, lemon twist.

Taste opens to pineapple resins with a light tinge of tangerine pith, wrapped in an undertone of freshly sliced mango laden with grassy hop textures; a grapefruit twang over the mid-palate phases effortlessly into a lemony dank finish with flaky malt accents and distant hints of pine.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; a wispy twang invigorates a vague bitterness over the mid-palate, trending sticky as pillowy resins take hold into the back end for a lush hop consistency, and a flaky crispness persists with drying undertones through the finish.

Levels of resinous saturation bridge West Coast and New England IPA elements, bringing into focus advanced tropical fruit development born from an ultra-refined and raw hop core, and a deftly established malt profile; this is a measured intensity, and a deceptively potent variation of the WCIPA.",4.5
Citra,"2021 Vintage

Appearance: Slightly cloudy amber-yellow color with a fairly generous generous-sized thick, foamy white head that slowly faded. A nice looking IIPA for my tastes.

Smell: Citrus, tropical fruit aromas and moderate pine aromas. Nothing to fault with the nose.

Taste: Moderately tart grapefruit/citrus notes, moderate tropical fruit notes and mild pine notes. Some mild bready notes from the malts to counter all the hop notes. The beer has a strong hop backbone that provides a fairly dry finish that lets the fruity notes die off gradually.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a generous level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IIPA.

Overall: A great IIPA. A very good hop flavor profile with enough of a malt backbone to produce a good flavor profile. i wish I had a time machine so that I could decide if OG Nelson or Citra was/is my favorite IPA/IIPA.",4.5
Citra,"Canned on 3/22, freshest I've had by some margin!
L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint.
S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect.
T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some.
F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time.
O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer. Drank fresh, it is an absolute revelation in a time where the IPA market is oversaturated and often difficult to get excited about. Seek it out!",4.75
Citra,"Points off on looks only because the head is fairly scrawny; much less than a finger in my pint glas;. nice lacing though. I have a lousy nose but as soon as I opened the can I could smell fruity goodness with citrus dominating. The taste is so well balanced, with a good amount of juicy +hoppy. Citrus flavors dominate but certainly only part of a really well balanced flavor profile. I really like this one a lot. More, please.",4.75

West Ashley,"SARA does great with all their Saisons. However, I expected the apricot to pop out a bit more than it did. I enjoyed this beer very much but felt like the hype perhaps made me have higher expectations. I’m very interested to try again and taste other vintages as well.",4.0
West Ashley,"Most recent batch. Thanks, Sam!

A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing this looks great. The nose is super ripe, fruity, floral apricots with a lactic saison adjacent base. Delicately floral fruit notes, probably from the Pinot Noir casks, is present, though this doesn't have a real red wine character. Vanilla to go with ripe apricots. Awesome. The fruit expression is sublime.

The palate opens with a blend of lactic tartness, mildly yogurt like with lots of fresh apricots. Just tons of it, though in a nuanced, delicate way rather than the unabashed abandon that's Fou'Foune. No real funk here, this is fruit and acidity in perfect harmony. Vanillin, delicately fruity Pinot Noir, a nice tannin character are all present. Drying, lactic, fruity on the finish with lots of lingering apricots. Tannins and a little grain round out the finish. SARA beers aspire for a higher ideal in the mouthfeel category, and this beer delivers. Light, airy, parfait-like with tons of fine carbonation, just enough to lift the fruit heavy beer but not so much that it's anywhere close to being foamy. Gentle, coaxing, prodding, this is a truly excellent beer.

In contrast to the fresh Fantasia I had a couple of nights back- this has more fruit, more sourness but less funk and less depth outside the fruit. They are both equally good interpretations of the style, and I can see my preference flip flopping.",4.5
West Ashley,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden orange color with high carbonation and a white head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh sweet apricots and light barnyard funk.

Taste - What strikes me about this beer is how well the apricots and saison funk work together. At the front, the fruit was sweet and fresh before turning funky in the finish. The finish was tart, but not overwhelming.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation was high, erupting from the newly opened bottle. The dry finish had nice lingering power.

Overall - What a well-crated saison!",4.5
West Ashley,"One of my favorites of all time of any style.
Roll the bottle around before opening to get a little bit of cloud from the yeast on the bottom, if that's your thing.
Smells like lemon, sour cherries, peachy.
Tastes just like the smell. Dry, smells sweeter than it tastes. Hint of funk.
West Ashley used to taste a lot more tart, but just tastes like sweet nectar now after having it so many times.",4.75
West Ashley,"Orange citrus with peaches, this is so easy to drink its no wonder it is in a 750ml bottle. Sante focuses on this funk that their beers offer that I have not tasted in many other breweries that are also known for their ales and saisons, and this was no slacker. A very mellow orange taste is felt at the start but soon the strong peach taste in this one that will blow your mind, the tartness you would expect is minimal if any as the peaches are sweet enough to make your tastebuds focus on that.",4.5

Ephraim,"Canned on 5/25/22; consumed on 6/14/22

Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.

Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.

A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base.",4.25

Ephraim,"This one pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like intensely resinous piney hops, grapefruit rind, booze, pineapple, and grapefruit.

This is definitely a bruiser, and easily the booziest HF IPA I've had, which makes a lot of sense. It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy.

This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol. Despite that, it's still pretty drinkable for me.

I've been waiting to try this one for a long time now. It's not quite the absolute revelation I was hoping for, but I'm still really with it.",4.25

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2022 vintage

Alright, time for the highest rated American Strong Ale, which is quite the ambiguous style, but I’m excited regardless. Especially after having The Rusty Nail and knowing they excel at using cinnamon as an adjunct, I can’t wait to try this. Let’s get into it

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is super cinnamon forward in the nose, almost too much but it’s still nice. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, spicy whiskey, and toasted oak

It’s a bit more balanced in taste, and very good, but I was expecting this to pop more. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, toasted oak, earthy cinnamon, raisin, earthy whiskey, brown sugar, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, sweetened coffee, milk chocolate, toasted oak, caramel, and bourbon. Gets better as it warms but I wanted more complexity out if it

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a lush yet zippy beer. Finishes dry for everything going on and drinks well below the 13% listed

Given the fact that it improves over the course of drinking it, I have to bump this one up a bit in the overall. Still not everything I was hoping for but very good",4.5

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2017 limited release Coffee Cinnamon Barrel Aged B-Bomb, imperial winter ale. Aged (4 years? or nearly 5?) in my cellar and served chilled in a Chimay chalice. Oil slick appearance and a big warm cinnamon nose that fills the room. Really that aroma is hard to beat. Flavor is creamy and mouth-encompassing with waves of caramel, cinnamon candy. Ultra-fine carbonation adds milkiness to the mouthfeel. Mocha and coffee flavors are initially mellowed but there's a more pronounced coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Vanilla flavors from the bourbon are also mellow, and I don't get any harsh whisky flavor at all. Pretty amazing for 13.0% ABV. World-Class absolutely describes it. I don't believe I've ever had this fresh, but I have no regrets about aging it this long.",4.25
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2019 Vintage

Pours out a dark brown, nearly black liquid. Aggressive pour yields a half of a finger of khaki head. The foam sticks around for a while. It didn't look too thick on the way into the glass. Stouts just have a certain way of looking and you can guess that this might not be one.

Nose indicates that it's definitely not a stout. Coffee comes forward first, but not in your face with roasty qualities. There's actually a slight hint of sweet fruitiness that accompanies this coffee. Reminds me of Jamaican Blue with its delicate, fruit-forward tones. Next is the presence of molasses spice cookie. There's this mildly bitter, peppery, spicy sort of thing lurking underneath. It smells quite captivating so far, if a little on the weak side.

Taste is everything that was in the nose and more. A natural evolution. Mildly roasty and fruity coffee, cinnamon, bitter black strap molasses, a faint bourbon/oak, black pepper, but without the heat, and dark grainy bread. Along the lines of rye or pumpernickel. I got that in the previous B-Bomb I had as well. Very unique quality. These flavors unravel spectacularly, never once stepping over each others toes or vying for attention. Nicely balanced, not too bitter, not sickly sweet.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Not thick like a stout, but a nice density. Not too cloying, alcohol evaporation drying it up a little. Mild carbonation.

Overall a fantastic brew for the winter. A great sipper to have with friends and to ponder life and enjoy a snowy winter landscape. Cheers to Fremont who continuously knocks it out of the park.",4.5
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2019 version, aged at Fremont purchased through Tavour. My second version of B-bomb, but I haven't had the base beer yet.

This is well rounded and wonderfully balanced overall. The barrel presence is magnificent, no surprise from Fremont, rich with bourbon and mellow vanilla with hints of oaky leather. I want my funeral pyre built with spent staves from Fremont barrels.

Under all that was creamy cocoa, dates and raisins, caramel, subtle coffee, and dessert like cinnamon. This is wonderful as is, but I hope I get to try a fresh bottle someday with more assertive coffee notes.

Now having 2018, aged and purchased under the same circumstances. This version was a few bucks cheaper for some reason. This was drier and a bit roastier. Less cinnamon and surprisingly more coffee maybe. Just a bit less decadent than the 2019.

Edit 4/1/22 got my wish, now enjoying a fresh 2022 bottle. The coffee is more assertive but so is the cinnamon. I'm also getting a strong coconut note. Huge barrel presence but the figs , cocoa, and raisins are subdued. It's wonderful now, but I think I'll age the other for a year or so.",4.75

L: pours a nice very dark black brown with a moderate tan khaki head. Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does

S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat

T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot

F: medium body, medium carbonation, would have liked it a bit thicker but not sure if that’s me thinking stout vs. winter warmer (what is the appropriate body for the style?)

O: a really nice winter warmer (not that I’ve had many in the style). Solid nose, great flavor - some age in the bottle has muted the adjuncts but I’d say they still come through well",4.5

S: cinnamon and lots of it. Bit of sugary caramel from the barrel.

T: wow! Again, loads of cinnamon both in flavor and in heat. I don't taste the coconut so much as feel it, it adds a lot of richness to the brew and leaves an oily, coconutty film after every sip. Bourbon barrel adds a lot of sweetness which balances everything out.

Big pineapple aroma with tropical Starburst, dank jungle weed and mango beneath.

Pineapple-forward taste as well, coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. There was fairly strong Playdoh in there at first, too; it might have been connected to the head, because it faded after the first few sips.

Huge bourbon booze starts the nose with chocolate fudge, roasted malt, coffee, solid rustic oak, molasses, dried dark fruit, and vanilla. Taste is much the same as the nose but not as nuanced, barrel stays strong, vanilla steps up, caramel enters in, dark fruit fades away. Feel is big, boozy and dark, just what they are going for, even with some age it still bites.

Saison Du Fermier,"Thank you not2quick for this one!

750ml bottle - blend 5 - poured into a chalice at 50°F.

Pours a clear, deep straw-golden hue, with just a cast of unfiltered fog, and a finger of creamy, soft, off-white head, eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind. Visible effervescence.

Nose: Soft, pale rustic grains, with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay, dewy grass, and some dusty silo. There is some remarkable floral character, lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth, with lemon blossom, wet stony minerality, and a lightly musty oakiness. Some very restrained white vinous notes, along with a touch of pear, apple, and apricot. Gentle hints of honey, lemon zest, and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display.

Palate: Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang, semi-sweet grist with some crackery, bready, and rustic grainy notes, and an explosion of bright, shimmery fruity notes. Lemon, nectarine, apricot, tart white plum, green apple, Asian pear, and a sweet-tart balance of fruity white grape. There's a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front, along with some wet limestone. Some Belgian-like saison yeast brings that fruity, undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops. Finish is oaky, dry, and lightly tannic.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a tight, snappy crispness - bright and fluid, but there's enough grain to lend some softness and presence. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy, but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy. Tart and wet up front, finishing with an increasingly dryness, and a touch of cling.

Overall: A lot of the fruited and more recent Side Project offerings have been trending more and more acidic, which can really bring it down fast. This one shows the balance and softness that I know they're capable of. It retains much of that classic Belgian saison character, while contributing the classic Side Project culture and grist character. Soft, balanced, bright, and absolutely dialed in.

Pours nearly pitch black and still, with just a small layer of tan bubbles than quickly fade to a thin ring that leaves no lacing but nice legs

While I appreciate this not having the typical TH Stout sweetness in the nose, it’s not as complex as I had hoped though still good. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and raisin

It is sweet in taste, but not in any cloying way, rather it is kept wonderfully in check by many complex notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting milk chocolate, plum, vanilla, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, black cherry, and burnt caramel. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, boozy bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, black cherry, pecan, toasted oak, and dark roast coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sweet beer. Finishes sticky and heavy but not overwhelmingly sweet

Truth,"750 ml bottle.

Gentle pour brings a pure jet black motor oil color with a finger of caramel head. Good retention for the style. Leaves a halo of lacing around the glass. Settles into a thin film laid carefully across the beer.

The aroma brings strong notes of bourbon, dark fruits, caramel, dark chocolate, and pecans with loads of vanilla, oak, toffee, dark roast coffee beans, light char and a bit of smoke.

The flavor has tons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chip cookies. There's loads of Hazelnut coffee, toasted pecans and almonds, as well as bourbon, vanilla, oak, fig, plum and caramel. Boozy but at 12.3% this should be expected. A lot going on here but it all works perfectly together.

The feel is full bodied, chewy and syrupy. Almost no carbonation but plenty of booze, as expected.

Overall, I might be a Tree House fanboy but I've been quite critical of their stouts in recent years. They've become a bit too sweet with minimal balance. Just chocolate syrup. This bad boy, however, is one of the rare barrel aged stouts they have. Fortunately, I didn't pay anything for the beer as the bottle was shared with a friend.

Review #2100

Medium bodied dark brown/black appearance. Somewhat thinner in appearance and lighter in color than I anticipated. The beer was topped by a small cap of bubbly, cappuccino colored froth that quickly broke apart. A medium sized halo encircled the liquid.

The aroma was solid initially but somewhat subtle. Malty notes dominated. Roasted malts were most apparent. Good dose of caramel malt character too. Moderately sweet. Slightly smoky. Almost a touch peaty. Dark fruits were also detectable. Raisins, plums and figs perhaps. There was a bit of a papery oxidative quality as well, but this subsided with time. As the beer sat, the aroma intensified. The dark fruits, the sweetness and the smoke became notably punchier.

The flavor profile followed the nose. Rich and malty up front but less intense than anticipated. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malts. Slightly smoky. Boozy notes kicked in as the beer moved along the palate. Port soaked raisins came to mind. There was a bit of a chocolate/Tootsie Roll-like character too. Subtle metallic notes appeared on the back end, but they dissipated with time. More lingering booze and sweetness on the finish.

The mouthfeel was solid but thinner bodied for a beer of this magnitude. Smooth and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate.

Tree House make some amazing adjuncted milk stouts, but their purely barrel-aged releases seem to be a bit lacking in intensity and mouthfeel. While this was an enjoyable beer, it did little to stand apart from the pack.",4.25
Truth,"I’m the resident TH fan but this is damn good! Chocolate, vanilla bourbon & almost everything you’d want from a BA (no adjunk) stout. If I’m picking nits (I am) it doesn’t have quite the flavor pop as something like BBT but does have similar complexity",4.75

Taste - a little sweet but not overly sweet. dark chocolate some char woodiness along with the toasted coconut and vanilla.
Feel - Medium full body with a medium light carb, slight creaminess

Though I enjoy drinking socially, I do most of my drinking solo, which makes those 16 oz plus bottles a challenge. That might be the wimpiest thing I've said this week. I should probably go start my lawnmower in one pull to make up for that. As for the flavor, both the coconut and vanilla come through, but hold back from dominating the flavor profile.

Dark seal brown to bistre body with a thin fawn/camel collar. Vague lacing; fast running legs; poor retention.

Vanilla, barrel char, bourbon, roast malt, and a hint of tobacco, molasses, cocoa, and toffee in the nose.

Intense palate entry - all of the flavors above but concentrated. Rather sweet, with a long chocolate-laden finish. Some barrel/alcohol elements along with a gentle, clean bitterness add a little balance. Stewed dark fruit notes emerge as the ale warms. Neutral yeast character. Coconut and vanilla seem a little redundant, overwhelming their counterparts in the bourbon flavor, and reinforcing the borderline cloying impression.

Silky, almost oily, rich mouth-feel with active yet low carbonation. Moderately warming.

More on the dessert end of the spectrum for the style, but very potent with some balanced barrel influence. Enjoyed it more than my notes might suggest.",4.25
Bourbon Paradise,"Little to no head. Only a very thin tan ring clinging to the glass. Very dark like dark chocolate cake. The nose is chocolate and more chocolate. Bourbon comes right out of the middle of the chocolate. Vanilla and barrel leak out at the end. The taste has bourbon, vanilla, and oak jumping right out. Chocolate and a small hint of coconut follow. There is a small bit of spice that hides behind the coconut at the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but with the right amount of carbonation. This is a wonderful beer. It wants to be too sweet but stops just short and balances out to make you smile. (Found old notes on this one)",4.5
Bourbon Paradise,"2019 version enjoyed 27 months later.

Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy, dark mocha, almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly. When swirled, it coats the glass with a dark film.

Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging. This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more. Dark chocolate, black cherry, tobacco, roasted malt, some peat, and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel.

Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma, but they're still quite light given today's ""pastry stout"" standards. Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront. Bakers chocolate, some bittersweet chocolate chip, roasted malt, some peat, tobacco, black cherry, some fig, molasses, some brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon spirit. I'm sure there's some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel, but it's hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel.

Medium to high medium body. Slick, oily, sticky, warming. Could use a bit more body. Doesn't drink like 16%, but you know you're drinking a big beer.

I know I shouldn't have sat on this as long as I did because I'm sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character; however, the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this. It also has led to what I'd imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher. I'm sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more, but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where it's currently at.",4.25
Bourbon Paradise,"Wonderful brew. So far, my favorite.",5.0
Bourbon Paradise,"Poured a black body with minimal head and touch of lace patches but those quickly dissipate. The aroma is mostly booze to me, although some sugariness comes in as well so assume this is vanilla. Smooth beer, kind of buttery it's so slick, with a hot and boozy taste and feel with vanilla sweetness but also some slickness from hints of coconut. Real easy to drink for a slow sipper and there is a good amount of chocolate throughout the beer that balances well with the vanilla and coconut.",4.0
Bourbon Paradise,"BBA imperial (13.7% abv) stout featuring vanilla and coconut...

Nothing wrong here, but its an unexceptional take on the style - that said, yes - you get bourbon, you get vanilla, and you get coconut, too - high-abv stout body with appropriate chocolatiness and coffee - maybe I'm just jaded - this 12 oz. bottle was $9.99 IIRC - Prairie being notoriously high-priced (right? lol) - so in sum, you get what they advertise, but to my tastes it doesn't do anything with the ingredients that elevates it above peer drinks, or to justify the price... Fans of vanilla and coconut BBA stouts will absolutely dig this though...",4.0
Bourbon Paradise,"$12.99 per 12 oz. 13.7% ABV. Poured into a small-stemmed tulip.

Too much upon the first sip. Of course, after the initial shock your taste buds acclimate a bit. But overall, this ale goes too far with is coconut, vanilla, and sweetness. Thought the barrel-aging contributes to these faults I do not believe that’s where the mistakes were made. 3.5

A – Pours an opaque oily black, viscous with zero head. Syrupy. An alcohol “wedge” (not legs) on the glass. 4.25

S – Sweet, vanilla, bourbon barrel, coconut is on the faint side and seems to be overwhelmed by the other aromas. There are some roasted aromas as well, but behind everything else. A very complex aroma. 4.0

T – Coconut!!! Sweet. Alcohol is well hidden. No bitterness. Sweetness is a combo of the coconut and the brown sugar flavors. No spiciness to balance, just the ABV. 3.5

MF – Heavy bodied, sweet with a spirited finish, but not hot. 3.75",3.5
Bourbon Paradise,"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Fits the style perfectly, IMHO. The nose is led by the bourbon, but it’s surprisingly not too hot, and there’s a really nice vanilla note to accompany the dark chocolate and char notes, and there’s maybe a smidge of coconut.

Dark chocolate leads the taste, accompanied by the bourbon, and balanced by the vanilla and a more substantial coconut flavor. This is hefty and brawny, yet also well balanced, something that requires a lot of skill from the brewery in my experience. Prairie definitely has that skill set.

The mouthfeel is rich and slightly creamy, well suited to the beer. I really liked the base beer - a LOT - and this is better, IMHO. World class stuff here.",4.5

The Rusty Nail,"2022 batch, 13.6% ABV.

Pours a nearly pitch-black color. Befitting a huge, barrel-aged monster, there isn't much head, just a tan collar topping it off.

The aroma, though, is out of this world good. The focus here is on roasted malt, espresso, licorice, and baker's cocoa. A light touch of smoke gives it another layer of depth. There's a tiny hint of cinnamon lingering around, which is good: too much cinnamon would have hurt its chances at greatness. And of course, the assertive bourbon barrels can't be overlooked. Tons of oak, vanilla, and bit of corn shine through.

While the taste doesn't follow the nose super-close, it's wonderful in its own way. It starts off with a nice, sweet cinnamon flavor lacking the bitter spice of other (frankly lesser) cinnamon-adorned beers. Same with the bourbony finish: it's subtle yet noticeable, without being massively assertive. Dark chocolate, espresso, roast, and licorice round out the middle - again, enough to make you think, but not enough to overpower. There's a ton of stuff going on with this one, and actually coalesces together into something harmonious and complex instead of complicated and sloppy. The more I consume, the more I love it, therefore it earns an elusive 5 taste-wise.

It's not as texturally slick or slimy as other big oatmeal stouts, but by no means is it bone-dry. I could use a touch more body and thickness, but that's me nitpicking for the sake of picking nits. It's still as creamy and decadent as one could want from a monster barrel-aged stout. Carbonation is low, but it doesn't need much anyways since the oak tannins cleanse the palate decently.

I'm always that guy saying beer X doesn't live up to the hype or wondering how the hell beer Y earned a 100. This, though, this lives up to the hype and then some. It's one of the most complex stouts I've ever sampled, and - like I said - isn't complex in a ""some is good, therefore too much is even better"" kind of way. It's wonderfully cohesive and well-rounded in a way stouts not even a fourth as deep are. An absolute masterpiece, seek it out yesterday!",4.75
The Rusty Nail,"Look: like an imp stout should. Deep and dark. Some slight ruby/cola highlights around the edges when held to light. Modest mocha head on the pour that mostly recedes. Some oily, messy lacing that doesn’t stick around long.
Smell: cinnamon up front on a bed of roasty, bourbon, dark chocolate.
Taste: cinnamon and chocolate sweetness up front, countered by a nice roasty, slightly bitter char in the finish.",4.5
The Rusty Nail,"Sampling this 2021 vintage 22 oz bottle poured into my trusty snifter. Beer is part of a swap with @Resistance88 thank you!
The beer pours a thick , jet black coffee color with a dense brown head foaming up about 2 cm and gently cresting over the edge of my glass. No spillage out and no light passing through either. Looks the part of an imperial stout for sure.
the dense creamy head fades slowly to a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense coating lattice on each sip or swirl of the glass.
The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing, there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note. I also definitely get cinnamon, but its not artificial like Big Red, very earthy cinnamon note. Also some bourbon notes come through here. I dont get licorice that is on the label, which is okay as I dont tend to like anice/licorice aroma or flavor too much. I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 13.3%. Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose.

First sip reveals a full, thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation. Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip.
Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose. I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through. Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up, and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth, or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose?? Not really any char or heavy roast notes here. The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps. Hops, we dont need no stinkin hops! I dont get any on the flavor profile.
So the warmth could be booze or cinnamon, its not hot, just slightly warm.
The beer does drink pretty easy for its heft and I do enjoy it a lot. I got a second bottle of another beer to open after this, but I may just sip this one all night.
Very good brew!",4.5
The Rusty Nail,"Pour as black as black can be and the light brown head was sparse, short and faded quickly.
The aroma spoke more of bourbon than oatmeal, which is typical, (Oatmeal generally affects to feel more than the flavor for me in most cases) but I wasn't sure what to expect. The malts were very present, rich and deep. Strong coffee, cinnamon and bakers cocoa all made their appearance.
Taste followed, no new surprises awaited me except the sheer level of flavors that came at me. The prior BA stout today I could have (and would have) consumed a bomber of, but this one somehow go through to me rational mind that finishing it tonight would not be wise. So I'm testing the bottle sealer that so many have recommended.
The feel was pretty typical BA stout, as the bottle was from 2019 it may have lost a bit of it's carbonation but that didn't spoil anything for me.",4.75

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Velvety mouthfeel with a soft dry finish.

O - Top notch bba oatmeal stout.",4.5
The Rusty Nail,"i think i expected this to be mind blowing given my love in skinnamon. maybe i wanted more sweetness due to the molasses. anyway, i thought this would be 101% up my alley, and, while it way, it didnt quite live up to my exorbitant expectations. the beer was extremely drinkable. i really enjoyed it, but, alas, i found myself wanting it to be better. im definitely not poopoo-ing it as it was goddam delicious. ill ramble more tomorrow. maybe.",4.5

The Rusty Nail,"2020 vintage

Alright, I've obtained the highest rated Oatmeal Stout! This title used to of course belong to Founders Breakfast Stout, but the restructuring of BA rankings shifted it to this. I am very excited to dive into this massive beast, which is also my first beer from Fremont. Let's see what this is all about

Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, even after 2 years the cinnamon in this thing is still super prevalent. I'm picking up on aromas of cinnamon bark, milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak, spicy bourbon, light char and black licorice. Very earthy and raw

The earthy and spicy notes from the aroma is still present in taste, but it focuses much more on the smoother, somewhat sweet notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, fruity coffee, earthy cinnamon, caramel, toasted oak, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, spicy bourbon, dark chocolate, black licorice, dark cherry, molasses, and spent coffee beans

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy and lightly zesty beer. Finishes slightly sticky but dries over time. Decadent but not overly sweet

This is a fantastic beer. It is incredibly creamy, balanced, and complex. I would love to know what this is like fresh but this is a treat regardless",4.5
The Rusty Nail,"2020 release, enjoyed mid-February 2022. This is a very serious beer. Wow. Been chasing it for over a decade and happy to score a few back in 2020 and sitting on them for about a year and a half. Super sweet but not cloying, roasty and smoky without being off-putting. Pretty boozy in the nose, signifying it could use even more time to mellow. Luckily I have another bottle for years down the road. So smooth and easy-drinking but SO full of complex flavors. The best flavor in the finish is roasted marshmallows, without a doubt. Such a fun beer to drink. Epic stuff.",4.75
The Rusty Nail,"2021 Limited Release. Found quite a few of these Fremont gems at Albany, Oregon Winco. Poured from a wax sealed 20 oz into a 16oz glass.

Look: poured nearly black with almost no head.

Smell: notes of licorice and dark chocolate with a little bit of coffee.

Taste: one of the most intense and smoothest aged oatmeal stouts that I have ever had. No “cough syrup” sting, but notes of licorice, chocolate, and cherry. Nice finish, very smooth.

Feel: smooth and bold.

I am a huge fan of Fremont, so there is some bias. In winters past, my wife loved barrel aged imperial stouts, so this type of “beer” is familiar. This is intense. I’m half way through the bottle (by myself) for dinner and it continues to be an enjoyable sipping beer that will have me in good spirits for the rest of the night. I’m interested in the other bottles of limited release after enjoying this.",4.25
The Rusty Nail,"2020 vintage. Received from @snaotheus in the NBS BIF #14. Poured into a snifter at 63°. It pours an oily black with a half finger of creamy, medium-mocha head and thin coating of lacing. Very pretty. Its smell offers roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, pepper, earthy char, and a strong bourbon aroma. The taste is sublime! Like a dessert. It features dark chocolate, oatmeal, cinnamon, burnt coffee, anise, and a strong dose of bourbon. The flavors are distinct but blend magnificently. The result is delicious. The mouth feel is terrific: thick and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and the 13.3% ABV is warming but not distracting. Overall, The Rusty Nail is a magnificent Oatmeal Stout; the best example of the style I've had. It excels in all categories. I'm grateful to have had the chance to enjoy it.",4.75
The Rusty Nail,"Pours a viscous, oily, pitch black with a finger of mocha head quickly receding to a decent ring and leaving plenty of residual lacing. Aroma is oak, vanilla, cinnamon, burnt sugar, and chocolate. Taste is barrel on the front followed by cinnamon, sweet vanilla and sugar elements. Feel is velvety smooth, perfect carb, very full and enjoyable. Delicious beer, my highest rated for quite some time.

The Rusty Nail,"2018 Vintage
22oz bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy dark brown head that reduces to a ring around the glass

S- heavy barrel on the nose, plenty of wet oak, bourbon, cracked pepper, caramel and vanilla. Dark chocolate, black cherries, licorice and a nice dose of cinnamon. There's some dark fruit port-like aromas as well

T- Opens with bold oaky bourbon barrel with notes of barrel juice and peppery wet oak, immediately followed by a equal parts cinnamon. Mid-palate brings out notes of black cherry, figs, dark chocolate, black licorice and molasses. The finish gives more oaky bourbon and cinnamon that holds on into the linger

M- medium-heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into a warming finish

O- plenty of barrel adds a great complexity to the base beer, with the cinnamon adding a nice enhancement",4.5
The Rusty Nail,"The Rusty Nail (2021 Release) from Freemont. Received a 22 oz bomber in a LIF from @snaotheus. Stored at home at 38 degrees. Reviewed 24/10/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Served at 56.8 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.4 degrees.
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Black (SRM 40), opaque.
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, same, although some light does penetrate the edge and appears red.
Head – Average (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density, fizzy, quickly diminishing to a one to four mm bubble ring and no cap. Second pour produces a 0.9 cm head.
Lacing – None, hardly unexpected at 12.3% ABV.
Aroma – 3.75 – Initially weak licorice, no hops, no malt, no yeast, no cinnamon, faint bourbon as it warms, no oak.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins with the sweet taste of licorice and dates, no hops, no malt, no yeast. No cinnamon. Weak bourbon on the exhale with no oakiness. No ethanol (12.3 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Moderate gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy approaching syrupy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 This is one of those rare brews that looks the same in the glass as it does during the pour. It has a bit of the candi sugar feel of a Belgian brew, a bit sweet. The oats serve well, adding a luscious velvety feel across the palates. Unfortunately for my taste buds, the cinnamon is deeply buried and I’m not sure if I’m actually tasting it or only hoping that I am. As the temperature approaches 61 degrees, the alcohol begins to predominate, so it’s time to chug the remainder. Overall, a decent brew but one that is temperature (and possibly age) dependent.",4.25
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2020 vintage

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla

This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell

There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains",4.5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.

This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.

This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.

I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done.",4.0
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!",4.5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"I believe this was a 2018 bottle (4 years aged). Leaned towards a more licorice flavor. Didn’t pick up much bourbon. Solid beer/liquor drink (20% it’s hard to still consider this a beer). My guess is that perhaps it’s a little better if it were fresher, maybe 6-12mo age which is generally where I like my BA stouts.",4.25

Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Review #8000, 2015 vintage. This will be a very emotional review. Normally for big milestones like this, rudzud would have some crazy beer to share, but that can't happen now. Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders, saving for a special day. He might not be here physically to share it with me, but he's here in spirit.

Pours basically with no head, whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly, dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through, and legs for days

Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon, lots of vanilla oak, a bit buttery oak, fresh bourbon barrel juice, a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon, lots of dark malts under that, some roast and coffee, no char, loads of cocoa, dark chocolate, a little nougat candy bar, fudge, a bit of a chocolate syrup as well, a little alcohol

Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel, dark chocolate, raw cocoa, chocolate syrupy again, a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes, some roast and coffee as well, more like a coffee syrup, barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice, a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well, getting fudgey in the middle, some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla, a touch of baking spice, med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts, some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there, finishes sticky and coats the mouth, never really goes away, lingering cocoa, fudge, vanilla and generic whiskey

Mouth is full bod, rich syrupy and really coats the mouth, some hot tingly alcohol, med-light foamy carb

Overall quite nice, there have been better Bruery beers, but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice, although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh, but alcohol didn't destroy either as the age probably helped there.

I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing. Matt must have taken his sip, and I hope he enjoyed it. Miss the great bottle shares and fun times. This was just one more milestone in my reviews. I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews, and I guess he was right. I'll keep drinking beers, but I'll always have that hole that will never be filled. Cheers Matt!",4.5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Very good head production, considering the sky high ABV and double barrel aging. Quickly fades, as expected, leaving behind only a thin ring of foam around the edge. Body is surprisingly clear and cola-colored.

Boozy nose - whoda thunkit? The smell of bourbon, port, and brown sugar wafts over you from the pour itself. Up close it's similar but stronger: red grape, molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, honeycomb.

Strong, sweet, and boozy on the palate, with an alcoholic burn that grows and grows. Very slow sipper. Lasting heat in the throat and chest.

Incredibly deep and complex, rich and dark. Molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon mash, red grape, white bread, light toast, toffee, vanilla, espresso. Long aftertaste, although the booze understandably dissipates rather quickly.",4.75
The Peach,"Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch",4.25

The Peach,Holy peach!!! Love peaches in sours and this one is absolutely loaded with them. Pours and smells great and it tastes like a darn peach bomb. Unbelievable sour!,4.5
The Peach,"750ml bottle, aged in oak barrels, undated, poured into a stemless wine glass.

The beer pours a bright peach color, orange and gold hues, cloudy with a finger of fizzy white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. The aroma is wonderful, lots of fresh peach, bright and lightly tart with a nice floral quality, underlying fruitiness, lightly bacterial with a nice funk, soft oak and earthiness. The flavors are great, tons of peach, juicy, fresh, bright and tart with a nice oak barrel, sweet and chewy with a nice mustiness and funkiness while a soft floral bouquet opens up as it warms. The mouthfeel is good, coating with a delicate and lively medium body that has a nice tartness and finishes with a lightly dry bite.

Verdict: A nice wild ale from de Garde. Lots of peach, bright, fresh, just a touch sweet that really demonstrates the great qualities of the peach.",4.0
Supplication,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way.

Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.

Overall, very interesting and very good beer.",4.25
Supplication,"Brief Review:

O: My 2nd of 3rd RR sours I picked up from SF. This may be their highest rated. Nice brown ale with cherries, almost like a Flander's. Not too tart, which I like. Flavors are nice and clean. Good balance overall.

Recommendation: Doesn't really blow me away for a sour with this kind of reputation, but it drinks nice and is a good Spring/Summer beer.",4.5
Supplication,Wild! Received this from a good friend in the Bay Area. Works for me - it’s complex and skewed towards sour funkiness… very much feels sophisticated.,4.5
Supplication,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $13.99. Bottled 4-27-21; consumed 4-26-22.

Beer poured a pretty raspberry with a smallish white head that dissipated pretty quickly.

Nose is nice, berry forward, nice bouquet.

Taste is really well done; a substantial but light malt base combines nicely with the pinot noir barrel which lends the dark berry fruit flavor and a touch of tartness. The introduced Brett lends some funkiness. It finishes with a dry oak barrel.

Mouthfeel i s light bodied and very easy to sip.

Overall even thought my funky sour pallet is underdeveloped i can see this is a really well made beer as it is so flavorful and light and not overwhelming. Buy this if you like the style!",4.5
Supplication,"Bottled 10/22/21

Last but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer

Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum

It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar.

I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.
When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness.
The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness.
The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish.
This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!",4.75

Supplication,"The beer, poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop it's murky copper hue. The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite.",4.75
Supplication,"I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. ""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right?

Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable.

Taste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer.

Beatification,"Pours a beautiful gold with a clear transparency. No head formation. Aroma is green grapes, chardonnay, slight red grapes, cellar stone, grass, and mild oak.

Beatification,"Brief Review:

O: My 3rd “-ation” sour from RR. Either I’m just not into this American-style wild ale, or these are overhyped, but I just haven’t been blown away by these sours. They’re good, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think I’d seek them out again. More sour than tart, quite dry on the finish. Lacking in any true funky flavor or character.

Recommendation: At this point, if you’ve had one RR sour, you’ve probably had them all.",4.25

Continuing on with and nearing the end of my run of Russian River Wild Ales, we have the 9th highest rated of the style, and 104th overall. It seems that they’re really leaning heavily into the Americanized Lambic vibe with this one, so I’m interested to see if that holds true. Let’s find out

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with almost no head, just a ring of bubbles that leaves no lacing

Less than stellar looks aside, this one smells fantastic. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, white wine vinegar, acidic lemon juice, sharp oak, crackery malt, lime zest, white pepper, leather, and musty apple skin

Ok so the aroma was a knockout that had me expecting this to be super tart, but it leans into more of a restrained funk in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, straw, lemon zest, old wood, white grape, and flowers. The swallow brings notes of white pepper, wet hay, old leather, apple skin, white wine vinegar, and light bready malt. Really good but pales in comparison to the aroma

A medium body pairs with gentle acidic carbonation, resulting in a crisp and funky beer. Finishes very dry with a slight tartness

This is good, but I suspect that, for some reason, 2 years on it has mellowed it out far too much. Seems odd for a Lambic-inspired beer, but based on reviews of fresh bottle this seems to have lost its bite. I'd love to try it fresh one day though",4.25
Beatification,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $15.99. Bottled 4-3-20; consumed 1-6-22.

Beer poured a cloudy golden with a little head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is very nice, very funky and horse blanket forward, along with some acidic vinegar qualities, true to the style.

Taste is a light malt base that has some lemon and apple. The funk, horse blanket, and touch of vinegar blend in very nicely without overwhelming the palate. Finishes tart.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and neither overly refreshing nor smooth.

I am a fan of Russian River, Pliny the Younger still eludes my taste buds. Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles.
Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal.

The flavors in the beer are lemons, chardonnay, funky barn, horse blankets, straw, wheat, toasted crackers, a touch of apple cider, herbal, floral, and champagne-like flavor.

The mouthfeel of the beer is tart, tannic, and bright.

The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish.

The beer has this explosion of sourness and funk. The wine barrel aging comes through pleasantly taking the edge off the sourness. I not sure if this my favorite offering from Russian River. This beer is a solid example of a wild ale, but I will not drink it again.",4.25
Beatification,"Currently ranked #6 in the ""Wild Ale"" Top beers list and #70 in the Top Beers list with a perfect score of 100.

375ml brown glass bottle with hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip (as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork). Bottled 04/03/20.

""100% spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels."" ""Barrel aged 9 to 36 months"" (that's quite a spread...). ""...fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria."" 6.00% ABV.

HEAD: None really...just a floater ring that's rather thin and weak, dissipating in under 10 seconds.

BODY: Also a bit thin and weak, and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look.

I imagine I'm going to enjoy this beer, but we're kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance.

AROMA: Oak, barrel-derived vanillin, white wine, still cidre, obvious lactic acid. The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined they'd be coming in...they register, but it's not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales (I'm looking at you, Cascade Brewing). Doesn't seem as full of life and bacteria-ridden as, say, Allagash's coolship ales, but it's enticing with promises of ample barrel character, microfloral intricacy, and diverse bacteria.

I don't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in well-meaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection. Some green apple, sure, suggesting perhaps acetobacter. No vomit-redolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present.

Aromatic intensity is average for the style, maybe even a bit on the timid side. Doesn't scream acidity, but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria, hitting on all fronts (pediococcus, brettanomyces yeast, and lactobacillus. Not a lactobomb, yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beer's flavour profile.

I can't shake the feeling this would be better fruited. Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity; this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think it's worse for it.

Smooth, smacky, deliberately undercarbonated (and to good effect, I might add, evoking a fine Brittany still cidre), a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid-body.

Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling in-your-face, but I could do with more barrel flavour myself...I'd guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range, and that much to its detriment. I don't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak, and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour. I mean there's faint white wine - perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling - but it's not as overt or nuanced as I'd like.

Green apple/apple skins, orchard fruit, lime, rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces, scatterings of microflora (none of them as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour), vinegar/acetic acid, grass, hay, maybe some faint clove/spice from aged hops.

I suppose the bacteria dominate. Maltwise, I don't get much beyond 2-row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon-like cereal grains. Far from a sweet ale, and I do think it'd be better off fruited as noted above.

OVERALL: It's not a holy shit son of a bitch ""man, you've got to try this!"" sour ale, and it's not even Russian River's best wine barrel aged sour ale (I'd tend to favour Supplication in that respect), but as an American imitation of Cantillon's spontaneously fermented sour ales, there's no doubt it's rather good, if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category. I don't know that I'd shell out for it again at this price, but I'm glad to have gotten to try it. A long-time want and a damn solid ale, but I don't know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze - many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less.

I'm an unabashed Russian River fanboy, but while it's certainly rather good, the creme da la creme this is not, and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues (and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation) is beyond me.

If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style.

Keene Idea,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net.

Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.

In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer

It’s also currently sitting at #105 overall here, but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late. Let’s pop this open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose, adding a nice funk. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango, funky guava, lemon juice, crackery malt, and light passion fruit

It’s even better in taste, still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice, funky guava, mango sorbet, crackery malt, passion fruit, and light orange juice.

Lightly hazy orangey-gold, with about 1.5 fingers of pale orangey-tan head. Leaves behind about 1.25"" of 1/3 coverage streaky & spotty lacing, and a thin surface sheet, with a small mound of foam in the center.

Smell is light candied orange rind, a vague mix of fresh citrus, a bit of light pine, and some fresh-biscuit malt aroma .

Taste is a sweet orange rind flavor, but that of freshly-peeled orange rind that's been sweetened, rather that the usual dried /cooked[i.e., like marmalade] flavor. As such, it's also a bit sweeter than the usual too. Near finish, there's some faint pine, plus a touch of cooked sweet onion flavor (rather than the usual raw green onion). Very slight bitterness adds some balance towards finish, and lingers beyond. Brief, slight bread crust appears just as the liquid disappears.

Feel is heavy-side-of-medium, which actually seems lighter I would expect, given the aroma,taste, and abv. Slight drying effect after finish. A light internal warming feeling shows up after two or three sips, but no alcohol heat on the palate, or at the back of the throat.

Overall, pretty good. Better than all but one TIPA that I've had* . A little sweeter than I prefer, but not TOO much. Dangerously easy-drinking. That said, other than as an abv delivery device, (if you want that) I still don't see anything to recommend it over the DIPA, or normal version. All-in-all, a pleasant experience, though I prefer normal Sip just a tad more. :)

Triple Sunshine,"Pours a hazy, almost opaque, amber with a thick creamy head that slowly dissipates into a foamy ring. On the nose, tropical fruit, melon, with hints of pine and dank. On the palate, lots of citrus and tropical fruit balanced by a solid malt backbone. Very full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel due to the moderate carbonation. The high ABV adds a warmness on the finish. This is a sipper that develops nicely as it warms. Overall, this is a genre defining beer that might be the best example of an imperial IPA I’ve ever had.",5.0

T: 5. This is a style defining beer. Great bitterness. Piney hops. Sweet, malty bite that becomes more apparent as it warms. Nothing negative to be said. Fiver.
F: 3.75. This is where this beer looses some points as it is quite heavy. There is a lite burn. Sip slowly and enjoy.

Triple Sunshine,"Look...Light copper yellow with little haze and thin carbonated head.
Smell....Smell of melon and over ripe fruit with pineapple also on the nose. light smell of citrus dank. Candied pine
Taste...Melon sweet hop some burn, yum, A fullness of taste that has a piney resin with bitter sweet after. A complex and rich poignancy that lawson""s brings with the yeast.
Feel... Suck a thick fullness with the carbonation making it not appear sweet in the back. Excellent.
Overall...This is very good just not the sort i seek out, so my bias is somewhat inherent in the review I suppose. Clearly that bias reflects somewhat in the score but ""Whata You gonna do"". I don't gamble on triple IPAs too much but this was worth it, and the caliber of brewery truly pulled my hand towards the purchase.",4.25
Triple Sunshine,"Slightly opaque with some particulate matter in suspension. Inviting aroma of tangerine and honey malt. Rich flavors of tangerine, floral notes, and ripe stone fruit. Even mouthfeel, a tingly finish. Alcohol is well hidden, just a bit of warmth in the cheeks in the finish. Good beer.",4.5
Triple Sunshine,"pours a lightly hazy golden with white head. That familiar Sunshine nose of Mango, Peach, some papaya as well. Honey sweetness, papaya, honeydew melon, some residual resinous bitterness. You can definitely feel the heat which is quite fusel. It's like an underpinning of some vodka or something, so it really has the taste of booze soaked fruit. A bit astringent on the finish. I think beer of this alcoholic magnitude should show the booze (so people aren't pretending how alcoholic this is), this does, but it does detract from the overall experience.",4.0
Triple Sunshine,"Pours a semi clear orange yellow color with a thick one finger white colored head leaving a nice amount of lacing down the glass. Smells of sweet toasted malts, citrus and floral hop aromas. Tastes of sweet malt, earthy and floral hop flavors and a bit of a boozy kick at the end. Heavier feeling than it looks but smooth and balanced, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall excellent beer!",4.5
Triple Sunshine,"From a 12 oz. can dated 12/01/2021. Sampled Dec 30, 2021.

A more traditional looking golden appearance rather than hazy under a modest, fading white head.

Bold aromas of tropical fruits, citrus, dank, and resinous characters along with toasted bread crust and a hint of booze.

Medium mouthfeel.

Sweet and then those hop characters really jump forward and overtake everything. There is a slight booze burn at the finish and the booze seems a little more notable in the taste. Lingering finish.",4.0
Triple Sunshine,"12oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/2/21, so just over 3 weeks old.

Faintly hazy deep amber body. The loose bubbly head does not retain at all, hence no lacing.

Strong tropical fruit aroma.

On tasting, bam!! Big grapefruit, pineapple and other mixed fruit flavors. Solid malt base adds a sweetness. Warming from the abv.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a sweet warm citrus bitterness, grapefruit leading the way.

Overall, while all the parts may not be stellar, the overall effect is very good indeed. It is also dangerously drinkable, so sipper beware.",4.5

Notes of navel orange, tropical fruit and pith. Taste follows nose with a light herbal/medicinal bitterness that lingers at the finish.

T: Mango up front, then orange and tangerine. Finishes with grapefruit and a slightly dry bitterness. The flavors are encased by a supercharged hop character that creates a mild astringency.

F: Soft mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.

O: Enjoyable flavor profile but docked a notch for the hop burn.",4.25
JJJuiceee Machine,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/11/22. Space juice. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a thoroughly opaque, murky mango colour with a finger or so of super-soft, sudsy head. Retention is quite good, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing.

Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble. Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachy-bubblegum-yeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that.

Taste follows the nose inasmuch as it isn’t as intense as I expected - which isn’t entirely a bad thing. Tasting fleshy peach, tangerine peel and a shit-ton of macerated bitter green tree leaves. The usual, expected supporting notes of mango, grapefruit juice, papaya and sticky pineapple.

Feel is… this can is, what, nearly two weeks old and the hop-onslaught is still so intense that it no-shit made my throat constrict! I actually took a moment to wonder which of my neighbours was most likely to have an epi-pen. Aside from that, it’s soft and juicy, medium bodied and brightly carbonated. Dry, sticky lips.

Overall, aside from the epic hop-burn, it’s not as crazy as I might have expected - which, again, aside from the price, isn’t entirely a bad thing. Hey! what do you know, this is the 103rd Tree House beer I’ve reviewed. Point being: this one is virtually indistinguishable from probably 90% of the other TH NEIPA’s I’ve had. I could actually see myself drinking this on the regular, if my throat didn’t clench up and choke me to death.",4.5

Served in a tulip

Cloudy yellow ochre appearance. The turbid looking body was topped by a small, creamy, bright white crown that slowly transformed into a thin dollop of froth. Streaky, drippy lacing coated the glass and stuck around until the drink’s end.

The aroma was impressive. Really fruity and bold. Honeydew melon notes were most prominent. Peach and apricot also came through strong. Good dose of sticky mango too. Nice citrus presence as well. Juicy orange notes stuck out. After the head died down, the dry, chalky, proprietary Tree House yeast character appeared.

The flavor profile was very solid. Big honeydew melon presence up front. Loads of ripe peach too. Citrus notes took over mid palate. Nice melding of sweet, juicy orange and tangy tangerine. White grapefruit appeared on the back end. Pithy, bitter, grapefruit rind-like notes rounded things out in the finish.

Excellent smooth, creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence that turned frothy and slick on the palate.

Like the original Juice Machine, this beer was super fruity and bright up front but quite pithy and bitter on the finish. Although I really enjoyed it, there are many Tree House IPAs that are better.",4.5
Leaner,"Had on tap. Bright yet somewhat pale yellow opaque body with a white head and trace amounts of lacing. Smell has big peach with effervescent bright oak, wild yeast, flowers and pollen aromas.

Appearance: 4 - looks a bit pale, but the head stuck around beautifully. I was expecting a deeper orange.

Nose: 5 - holy peaches! I don't detect much of anything else. Doesn't even smell sour.

Taste: 5 - oo, this is more complex than I expected. Tons of peach, but otherwise very dry. You really get the barrel a lot. See kids, this is the difference between a slushy kettle sour and a proper barrel aged sour.

Mouth: 4 - just a drop flat. Thick for a sour, but I could use a few more bubbles.

Overall: 5 - an outstanding saison. World class.

Sunday Brunch,"Deep, dark black. Head was not as dark as I guessed it would be, more of an off white color. Strangely the nose is cinnamon at first, but after first taste then the nose was more coffee. Taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish. Not bitter, all smooth!! Great Porter.",4.75

500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. 2021 vintage. Received from the glorious @jonphisher.

Pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass. Smell is chocolate and cinnamon.

Taste is cinnamon first, and all else second. Milk chocolate is definitely there. Some coffee bitterness. Might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.

Mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick. Overall, this is a good beer, but too much cinnamon for me. But, I'm a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer.",3.75
Sunday Brunch,"Pours black with a light brown solid head. Super coffee roast aroma, very pungent.

Sunday Brunch,"-Thanks to Stephanie (Kane)
- Imperial Milk Stout brewed with Rook Coffee, maple, and cinnamon.

A: Beautiful cascading effect with a dark tan head that is creamy and dense, standing a true two inches. The exiting pour was coffee colored, thick and viscose as it slurps from the bottle. Strong lasting coverage. Lots of micro-bubbly activity.

S: Burnt molasses, and chocolate. Dark sweet fruit, plums, sugary figs outlines. Sweet caramel and milky vanilla highlights. The maple syrup is rich and sweet, as well with evident hints of cinnamon spicing. Sweet initially, rich chocolate and marshmallow with cocoa. Things progressively move towards a smooth roastiness of cold coffee, caramel, and milky vanilla highlights.

T: Sweet dark fruit, particularly figs and plums with a smooth campfire minerality for flavor. The maple syrup plays a strong and sweet role in the profile. Silty coffee and caramel, with some molasses are strong supporters. Silty coffee texture and covering with sweet caramel and roastiness teasing the tongue and inner cheeks. Sweet roasty sweetness of chocolate and coffee with vanilla and maple syrup highlights really define the flavor profile.

M: Silty smooth texture on the mouthful with a equally smooth silty mouthful contribute and are equally as impressive.

O: The syrup backing brings sweetness and depth, while the cinnamon spicing has a nice finishing and complimentary touch. Outstanding flavor and texture. Everything blends so beautifully together its almost unreal. Sweet milky-vanilla with maple syrup and a silty texture leads to an outstanding drinkability that is exceptionally smooth and extraordinary.",4.5
Sunday Brunch,"Appearance - The beer poured an oily black color with a tan colored head and lacing left behind.

Smell - to put it simply, it smells like cinnamon toast. They were definite bread notes.

Taste - This tasted like cinnamon toast. They were definite bready notes with spice with just a touch of maple sweetness. The cinnamon was nicely balanced and not oppressive. In the back, it leaned more towards bitter coffee as the sweetness faded.

Mouthfeel - Being a porter, it was a little less clingy than a stout with less tendency to coat the mouth. It was still able to linger for a while b

Overall - This was great. It was not as heavy as a dessert stout.",4.75
Sunday Brunch,Good milkshake flavor.,4.25
Mexican Brunch,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.

Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.

As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.

Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.",4.25
Mexican Brunch,"500 ml bottle poured into a teku

Sweet maple, vanilla cream and rich chocolate. The close adds spiced notes of cinnamon and pepper skin, as well as more rich mocha espresso to close it out

T- earthy and peppery coffee notes up front are immediately complimented by sweet notes of whipping cream, caramel and rich maple. Mid-palate starts to develop a rich dark chocolate mocha flavor that carries into a finish that brings out cinnamon and pepper, with the pepper providing just a hint of heat.

Mexican Brunch,"Appearance - The poured a murky black color with a dark tan head.

Smell - The nose was rich sweet chocolate. It may have been a chocolate maple combination.

Nillerzzzzz,"This one awoke Raul’s senses like Adriana Lima crossing the street in a onesie - but it’s still a onesie. Adriana in a skin tight pencil skirt this is not. It’s just too thin and not robust like John Goodman as Big Dan Teague.

Nillerzzzzz,"Poured pitch black with absolutely no head. At the nose is heavy vanilla, fragrance is sweet and delectable. Hard to pick up the bourbon but good nonetheless.

Then upon tasting, very heavy bourbon. Almost overwhelming and unbalanced. The vanilla is faint at first but as the more sips I take, the heavy sweet vanilla character starts to build. Faint marshmallow and vanilla bean ice cream. But I don’t know...for the hype, I kinda expected a little more sweetness (talking liquid dessert) from the vanilla and maybe less booze.

Mouthfeel more medium bodied; not super full and thick but still some richness from the flavors.

Overall: great beer! Been one of those beers I’ve wanted to try for quite a while. I would always be happy to drink this again and even make it to the next release if I could. But I admit, it was a little over hyped. I guess I had my expectations way high.",4.5

This monster pours a dark brownish black with a moderate head of light brown

give it a swirl and this one has some nice legs! Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark roasted
goodness, dark bakers chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, and astringent booze notes.

char, dark berry notes of blackberry and raspberry, brewers licorice, and dark bread.

Black Tuesday,"Received this beauty from Dimidiata in an LIF connected to NBS BIF #14 - and she wasn't even part of that BIF!
Poured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.
The aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)
The taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.
The feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.

Black Tuesday,"750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 09/13/21, 18.9% ABV. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little bit. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong.

Black Tuesday,"Pours close to jet black, small cap of tan head that settles to a thin ring; streaks of ruby when held up to light. Nose has huge notes of leather, molasses, and tobacco; bourbon and barrel notes come secondary as it warms, along with a bit of dark fruit. Taste is super complex, but definitely reflects the aroma - lots of leather, hearty, salty, iron-rich blackstrap molasses, Australian licorice; as it warms, more heat from the barrel, vanilla, char. Mouthfeel is very full, but with a small punch of small carbonation. Despite the warming heat, it hides its alcohol very well. Overall, definitely worth its reputation.",4.75

Black Tuesday,"Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father.

Alter Ego,"Not my favorite treehouse offering… but neither is Julius. This one has an interesting almost grape bubblegum thing that was hard to nail down exactly. More melon that citrus. It’s just another treehouse beer that you have to try to see how it compares. But for me, there was nothing standing out that i could really appreciate or even describe. Its very smooth drinking but to a fault in that it lacked any kind of bitter or pithy punch on the finish.",4.25
Alter Ego,"This one was just OK for me, much better IPA options from Treehouse in my opinion.",3.25
Alter Ego,"Now I think people fall into this Treehouse hype and believe me it is deserved. They make some of the best beers in the world. However, this is just a solid New England IPA. I have had things similar. Thick orange color with a fluffy head and bursting with citrus flavors. Where this separates itself is in its smooth drinkability. It goes down like an orange juice.",4.0
Alter Ego,"Pours an opaque dirty straw color with a half finger of head. The nose has notes of over-rippened tropical fruits with a hint of citrus. The flavor is the same over-rippened tropical fruitiness combined with a grainy quality. Like its less-evil twin Julius, the finish is pithy. Oddly enough, however, I think that Julius has a more potent bitterness.

The body is definitely hearty for the style.",4.25
Alter Ego,"Two months old. Can to willi.

Look: Pours a full and hazy, slightly brownish yellow. Fluffy white head, lots of lacing and no floaters.

Smell: Citrusy notes of orange, lemon and grapefruit complemented by hints of pineapple, white grapes and apricot.

Taste: Ripe tangerine and grapefruit paired with tropical mango and pineapple. The body is sweet and minimally zesty, the finish bitter and dry.

Feel: Full and juicy, almost creamy. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Great alteration of Julius with some added citrusy freshness rounding off the sweet base very nicely. Certainly one of the best sub 7% ABV IPAs out there which doesn’t have to shy away from its bigger siblings.",4.5

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: The label states that this is the ""twin brother to Julius"", and that it ""builds upon Julius with... Mosaic and Amarillo..."". A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far. The aroma offers upsome sweetish malt, soft berries, and orange. The flavor is fuller with additional notes of mango, passionfruit, peach, lychee, floral blossoms, grass, pine, and earth. A median bitterness balances it and along with a little bit of ""hop bite"" leads to a dry finish with some fruit, pine, earth, and spice lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. The head held up quite well and there are torn sheest of lace and craggy rings left throughout the glass. I actually like this better than Julius but that's probably just because Mosaic hops are my current favorite.

Alter Ego,"Canned 4/27/22. “You can call me Al” stamped on the bottom of the can

So this was literally canned fucking today. That’s wild to me, as fresh as Tree House can be. This is one I’ve somehow missed every time I take a trip out to the brewery, but I’m happy to finally get to it. Yet another TH beer in the top 250 as well. Let’s get into it

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose shows a surprising amount of balance, but it makes sense considering it’s based on Julius. I’m picking up on aromas of juicy mango, peppery hops, apricot, doughy malt, orange juice, and papaya

It is similarly balanced in taste, feeling bright and juicy. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tangerine zest, crackery malt, juicy mango, earthy hops, orange juice, and peach. The swallow brings notes of peppery hops, tangerine zest, crackery malt, papaya, gooseberry, and light orange zest

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

Yet another killer NEIPA from Tree House. Better than Julius, but not quite as good as King Julius still. Maybe it’ll be even better when it’s not so fresh",4.5

Pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

It’s quite soft in the nose, but there’s still the requisite funk. I’m picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar, lemon juice, wheat bread, wet hay, stone, and sharp oak

There’s more bite to it in taste, but conversely less grape. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting wildflower honey, lemon juice, straw, apple skin, red grape, light toasted oak, and a hint of cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, wet hay, sharp oak, red wine vinegar, crabapple, light blueberry, and pear skin

Saint Lamvinus,"Amazing beer, always a pleasure.",4.5
Saint Lamvinus,"2019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F.

Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty.

Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil.

Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith.

Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins.

Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity.",4.5

It’s very pretty for a beer. The perfect Instagram shot can be has for anyone with this given it’s bright colors. There’s a little lacing that stays around. I don’t get as much on the nose as I’d like from the absolute favorite IPAs I’ve had. It smells grapefruit zesty and you get that on the tongue. The beer shines through in its bitter balance with sweetness. Alcohol is very well hidden. Why do they make these in only 12oz cans!!

S: wow, that is a serious aroma. Big waves of raisin (more pronounced as it warms), dark chocolate truffles, and vanilla on a backbone of oak and barrel heat. Some caramel/toffee in the back as well

T: follows the nose well, chocolate notes lead nicely with raisin and vanilla not far behind. Chocolate covered raisins, some dark chocolate ganache, cream caramels. Get a nice coffee when nearly right out of the fridge, more than the nose suggested. Abv is there but never steals the show, makes itself known and nicely warming

F: low+ carb, heavy- body. Coats the mouth wonderfully, full without being overly viscous

Huge coconut right away in the nose, bourbon is present but light, get bakers chocolate and caramel more.

Taste: Barrel Aged Coconut Water

Feel: Far too light in my mouth for what I’m looking for.

Did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit. The thing I didn't like as much was the roasty taste, which I guess might be the porter part, but could also be some darker coffee roasts. And no hint of alcohol or barrel at all - this would have help for me. So be it, my opinion. I'd like to try a fresher bottle, but given the cost, probably only if I'm gifted it some day...fat chance at that! Cheers!",4.25

Notorious Triple IPA,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent.",4.5
Notorious Triple IPA,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft
Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat
Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows.

Pours a clear light amber with a small head. Looks thick. Lots of fine slow carbonation. Smell is booze, pine, lemon. Might get a little honeysuckle.

Taste is a boozy blast, lemon and citrus for sure, so much resin and pine, kind of dancing around -- first I taste this, then that then it switches again. Hard bitter finish. Something kind of tropical in there, too.

Nose: Beautiful. Roasted malts and dark fruit jump out immediately. The bourbon is definitely there, adding nice vanilla and caramel notes. Chocolate notes come through nicely. The nose is generally sweet, with no detectable bitterness. Molasses starts to get noticeable as it warms.

Taste: Wow. What a nice marriage of roasted malts and sweet bourbon notes. Dark chocolate, charred oak, toffee, vanilla, dark berries, raisins, dates, a touch of leather, earth, and brown sugar. This is just a fantastic barrel-aged stout. Each sip makes me want more.

Mouthfeel: Not the thickest stout in the world, but definitely creamy and silky. Just amazing. Overall, a huge winner in my books. I hope you track another down at some point.",4.5
Black Gold,"2020 vintage; consumed on 9/18/21

Pours an inky black body topped with over two fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored foam; decent head retention leaves paper-thin islands of cap, large, frothy collar, minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon.

Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish.

Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display.",4.5

Black Gold,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like roasted malt, spicy oak, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and vanilla.

This is definitely old school in execution - there's lots of roast and spice here. There's a big barrel character - oak char, vanilla, spicy bourbon - it feels like something that was in barrels a decently long time. There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness.

This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better.

There's a lot to love about this one - it's a good idea to revisit what barrel aged stouts used to be.",4.0
Black Gold,"Appearance - The beer poured a fuzzy black color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass.

Smell - The nose was malty bourbon. The booze does not dominate. There was a nice malty presence.

Taste - this was like barrel aged chocolate malt. The profile was well balanced. It was like chocolate malt, but it was not too boozy. Darker chocolate emerged at the finish.

Mouthfeel - The lower carbonation allowed chocolate to linger.

Overall - The chocolatey goodness lingered nicely.",4.5
Black Gold,"Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold.

And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived.

Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness.",4.5

T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected

Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.

Nose: 4 - not very intense, but what is there is divine. Pure maple and barrel.

Taste: 4 - nothing mind-blowing here, just a straight up barrel aged maple stout. Maple is tough to do well, and this is done well.

Mouth: 5 - this is where the beer really shines. It's thick and sticky, and I don't want to swallow it; I just want to chew it for a while.

Overall: 4 - very excited to have tried this one. Not obsessed but satisfied.

Cheers!",4.0
Beyond Good And Evil,"Pours jet black with minimal head. Smell of chocolate, barrel and slight vanilla. Taste of chocolate, maple and coffee. Neither the coffee or maple overwhelm the base stout. Feels thick and decadent but cohesive. Another great HF brew.",4.5

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,"Excellent Porter. One of the best. Roasty, complex, bold. Super challenging to acquire but definitely worth the chase. Got to try High Coast next to it too. Amazing combo!!!",4.25
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,"Pours jet black with a small tan head. Intense roast bordering on Smokey. Chocolate. Definitely some bourbon heat along with vanilla infused oak. Quite dry. Heat of the alcohol overwhelms my palate making tough to judge IBUs. Full bodied, long lasting finish.",4.5
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,"Bottle, RBESG 2007 in Glasgow, Grand Tasting. Pitch black colour, creamy brown head. Very nice aroma of chocolate and roasted malts, hints of oak.

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,"2014 review.... it’s boozy, but I’m no way does this compare to today’s barrel aged beers or flavored barrel aged stouts, this is crap...... boozy and messy. Low grade fuel and GTFOH with stupid old money v new money comments",2.25
Gggreennn!,"From a 16oz can dated 5/26/22 into a tulip. Can message: 5 More Games. Go Celtics!

Pours an opaque pale orangish yellow with about three fingers of white head. Amazing retention and lacing.

Crack of the can is big pineapples, oranges, some grass and a hint of melon and peaches.

Getting citrus peel in the taste-very nice bitterness-along with some of the aforementioned fruits. Well balanced taste.

Soft, full-bodied mouthfeel. Nice bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

Wonderful beer to experience. Green or Gggreennn? Tough call to make...",4.75
Gggreennn!,"TGIG. Tree House makes some funky fruity stuff that so far I've had some difficulty ""appreciating"". Just had a few bad sips of one such bitter fruit bomb. Then switched to GGGreennn! Like aloe on a burn. Yeah, I""m still not totally comfortable with the beige (or ecru?) color with a lot of these types of beer, but the suds look great, the smell is good, the taste is great. Ahhhh.",4.5
Gggreennn!,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy, slightly muddy yellow with a stable foamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. A few floaters visible.

Smell: Fresh citrus fruits and pineapple. Green and a bit dank.

Taste: Green hops and fresh fruits. Citrusy (lemon and orange) and tropical (pineapple and guava). Some hints of sweetness and a zesty, very bitter finish.

Feel: Juicy and quite crushable. Medium carbonation and some sharp notes.

Overall: As much as I prefer Very Green over Green, I prefer Very Gggreennn over Gggreennn. Sounds confusing, but this one tastes just a bit too green for me. It's still a very nice brew with the typical Tree House characteristics.",4.25
Gggreennn!,"16oz can at share. Hazy yellow golden pour with a small foamy head. Aroma is fruity, tropical, green. Taste adds some dank notes to the fruity, tropical, citrusy base with a hefty helping of bitterness.",4.25
Gggreennn!,"I wish I had both Very Green and this and could go back and forth to compare. Very Green is probably my most favorite beer I’ve ever had. The flavors, the aroma, all of it. This is every bit what Very Green was from what I remember. I can’t say if it’s more flavorful or not, I just don’t have the reference point. All that being said, hot damn I love this beer. So dynamic. Juice slams you in face on the initial sip and then it fades to a piney after taste. You really kinda hit both NEIPA and West Coast styles all in one sip. Their is a slight difference when drank from the can and a glass. The can lip seems to fizz up the beer and almost hides some of that juice at the start. From the glass it’s so pronounced and smooth. The “green” beers are heaven, and the TreeHouse concept of “maxing them out” is a wonderful idea. It’s like heavy legs day at the gym. How much can I really do? Can not wait for another excuse to be in Western, Mass.",4.75
Gggreennn!,"Cloudy OJ color with three fingers of dense, yellowed head. Great retention and soapy lacing.

Big pineapple and Orange Julius in the nose. A hint of savory Italian herbs below.

Some of the pineapple carries over to the taste, but there’s a lot more lime, white pepper and pithy bitterness here. A little orange juice peaks out under the pith every once in a while in the aftertaste.

Full bodied and slick with strong carbonation.

Not bad, but the lime and pith combo is a touch too strong to my preferences.",3.75
Gggreennn!,"Poured into a 20 oz Snulip glass canned on 2/15/22. Pours a very attractive yellow orange with a finger plus sticky white head that leaves thin bubbles of lace with excellent retention. 4.75

Aroma ripe honeydew, guava, candied tangerine, and apricot really nice. 4.5

Taste follows guava, tangerine, honeydew, and apricot really well balanced. 4.75

Mouthfeel is above average, soft gentle creamy mouthfeel, not dry or sticky, and at 7.5% it drinks bigger in flavor, but goes down very easy. 5

Overall another amazing beer experience from this awesome brewery. Another huge wow factor. 4.75",4.75
Gggreennn!,"Pours an opaque OJ yellow, frothy 1.5"" white head with moderate retention and good lacing. Nose is mostly tropical - papaya and passionfruit juice, along with spent grain. A hint of spicy alcohol as well as it warms. Initially, the taste answers the question of what adding more Sunny D to a glass of Sunny D would taste like. The answer is Sunny D. It's OJ without the tartness, sweet yet somehow watered down at the same time. Flat, one-note sweetness. On the finish, however, it does develop some - hints of hop spice, a little resin here, a little pine there. White and black pepper. Mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly soft and full. Was hoping for more resinous punch here given the reviews, but any ""greenness"" takes a backseat.",4.0
Gggreennn!,"Canned 12/23/21. Green indeed. Earthy, piney, grassy, lime peel, grapefruit pithy. Super dry. I assumed this was a juice bomb based on the haze but this is anything but. New school look with old school flavor.",4.25
Gggreennn!,"So i chugged 3 of these, and they smelled and tasted foul, hence the need for a funnel. I also didn’t love how it felt, so I was originally thinking 2 there. It did look amazing in the funnel, so there is the 5. Then I blew chunks all over my date, and that made me feel like a 1. So overall I give it a 2, because it was funny to see all the chunks in my girl’s hair.

Addendum: My girl just said she got some GGGreennn in her mouth and it was good, so i raised the taste to a 3.",2.0
Gggreennn!,"Darker yellow thick haze with a white head appearance, decent lacing. Taste has strong hops in juicy matrix with lime, lemon, weedy and leafy hops, melon rind, papaya, aftertaste is grapefruit pith to the max.

Much prefer very green but still a good neipa",4.25

I made the mistake of drinking a Jjjuliusss before this beer, based solely on ABV%…we’re so spoiled now. I’ve always loved Green and Very Green was simply incredible. So…massive resin, super earthy, but all the Green you know and love. TH just doesn’t miss.",4.75
Gggreennn!,"16oz. can into a Founders snifter. Shared with schen9303.

Muddy but with a real nice head and excellent lace. Nose is malt, citrus, mango, grass, and a slightly acidic and sweet juice. Aromatic. Beer opens citrus, mango, and starfruit. Clean and bright. I get notes of more citrus, dry, slightly grassy with loads of grapefruit. End of more citrus and mango. Very good. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and goes down dry and filmy. Bone dry going down with a long, lingering finish.

Very good but this is a touch disappointing given how good Green is.",4.25
Chocolate Rain,"2017 vintage

It’s been a while, but I’m back with another BIF beer from @Eziel! This guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff, and I’m hyped to try this one out. I really liked the raspberry cobbler Black Tuesday variant, so I have high hopes for this one too. Let’s dive into it

Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing

The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses

Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat

Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better",3.75

Chocolate Rain,"2013 Vintage, drank 02/05/21

Look - Black, with a brown twinge

Smell - Very strong Chocolate, tobacco, and bourbon barrel. As it warmed up, the aroma really came through

Taste - WOW, this was better than expected. Chocolate Fudge, Anise, and a heavy barrel presence. At 18%, it hides the alcohol really well. It’s there, but I’ve had 10% beers that are more boozy. Awesome after dinner sipper

Feel - A little thin, but it’s from 2013. Actually not nearly as bad as expected.

Overall - This was a pleasant surprise. Being from 2013, this beer has held up VERY well. Really smooth, bourbon barrel chocolatey stout. Enjoyed this more than it’s base Black Tuesday. Those cocoa nibs must add something special!",4.75

S: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon.
T: Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon heat, oak. Roasted malt, date/fig, brown sugar, black licorice notes.

M- Smooth, full body, minimal heat for the ABV.

O- This is fantastic. I recently reviewed a fresh can of Black Tuesday, and I will say between the aging of this and the cocoa and vanilla additions it smooths out all the rougher edge of the Black Tuesday.",4.75
Chocolate Rain,"2016 release - consumed on November 12, 2020.
Pours a very dark brown. 1 finger off white head. For the ABV, the retention is good. The head dissipates to a ring around the edge of the glass. There's some decent carbonation rising in the glass that makes the ring swirl about. No lacing on the glass.
The nose is a sweet toffee aroma from the barrels. I do get a chocolate and vanilla undertone.
Taste - Like the nose tons of toffee. The chocolate is really muted. I don't know if it would be stronger fresh. The chocolate and vanilla are on the backside.
Very boozy, which isn't surprising. Even aged 4 years, very ""hot"". It isn't as thick as I was expecting.
This is an interesting beer. good, but you know it's very strong, and must be slowly enjoyed.",4.25
Chocolate Rain,"Boy oh boy. You take an already infamous beer and up the ante by adding vanilla and cocoa. Gnarly. It's a beastly beer that is a true sipper if Ive ever seen one. It's rich, dark, heavy, sweet and delicious. The addition of cocoa and vanilla add flavor to a beer that, honestly, didnt really need any help but somehow serves as an upgrade. Great beer, share it with good friends, dont drive afterward.",4.5
Fundamental Forces,"For the 2021 version! Sweet and rich chocolate malty, hint of vanilla, and hint of bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with a dark chocolate bitter, floral vanilla, and balanced boozy bourbon finish. A slight hint of age/oxidation can be detected on the backend, but this has aged/settled in extremely well for being about a year old. The bigboi booziness that you would expect at 17+% is there, but it is smooth and enjoyable...it starts to peek out a bit more as it warms. And, the mouthfeel is darn near perfect. Outstanding!",4.5

Fundamental Forces,"Fundamental Forces is an Imperial Vanilla Stout from Bottle Logic. The one I drank had an ABV 17.17%, so a little stronger. I guess the Fundamental Force I got was the Strong Nuclear Force, the one with Gluons and Mesons. It's recommended with brownies. I didn't have brownies but my wife suggested oreo cookies but I thought that I didn't need to double it up. This beer is like 8 oreo cookies and that's enough. Maybe a little sweet, but it's good, very good, slightly boozy (well ABV 17.17%) but with all the other flavors that is not an issue.

Look: black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head

Aroma: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon

Flavor: What stands out is the vanilla, the bourbon, the roasted malts, the coffee and chocolate.

Fundamental Forces,"Pours a deep black color with a nonexistent head leaving a thick lacing down the glass. It smells of huge coffee, sweet vanilla and bourbon aromas. Tastes of sweet vanilla a bourbon, hints of coffee at the end. Very sweet but excellent flavors. Thick, heavy, warms on the way down. Overall it's an excellent beer, very high abv so beware!",4.5
Fundamental Forces,"Midnight black pour with a thin brown ring and webbing. Huge aromas of vanilla lead the nose, with fudgey chocolate, full bourbon with potent molasses mash, chocolate truffle, hints of marshmallow and light plum liqueur. Amazing in the potency and complexity while keeping vanilla a star. Taste is a relative disappointment, like FO without the impeccable that has the flavors meld together. Bourbon and vanilla are in one camp, and chocolate truffle in another during the sip. Still delicious, but want more integration. Much warmer than FO too, feel is not as smooth or lush, but instead chewy. Still a wonderful stout well worth your time, but much prefer fundamental observation. The wife liked it",4.5

Received from @beersnake1 in Bif15 , poured into a smog city brewing glass also from him. The #4 ranked barley wine on beer advocate is a double barrel aged barley wine


Brewers Notes: A blend of two different Double Barrel-Aged Barleywines. The first Barleywine was aged in a Woodford Reserve Malt Whiskey barrel for over 20 months, then finished in a combination of Weller and Blanton Bourbon casks for close to a year. The second Barleywine was first aged in an Armagnac puncheon for close to two year, then finished in a blend of Heaven Hill Rye and Sazerac Rye casks. Each beer was cold-conditioned in stainless, and then blended together to create this Double Barrel-Aged Barleywine.


Dark , murky, muddy brown liquid capped by a thin taupe foam layer , quickly recedes to a taupe ring

Aroma is bourbon, raisins, toffee

Taste is bourbon soaked raisins, toffee, dark fruits ,

Mouthfeel is soft and fizzy , sweet , the 15.7 % abv is very well hidden

Great beer , another want ticked off my list courtesy of @beersnake1, thank you",4.5
Double Double Cask,"WOW,what a kick ass beer!",5.0
Double Double Cask,"A: Pour an almost opaque yet still clear dark mahogany in color with light to moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate chestnut brown + cola brown + garnet red + ruby red colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a small to medium sized patch of wispy very thin film covering approximately 25% of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edge of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + Rye over the top of slightly stronger than moderate aromas of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. Light to moderate aromas of toasted oak + vanilla.

T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of toasted oak + vanilla. Finally there are moderate to strong flavors of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + spicy Rye. No perceptible hop flavor is present and the booziness along with spiciness from the rye linger well through the finish.

M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with slightly heavier than moderate amounts of alcohol warming in the finish.

O: Drinks quite easily considering how big/strong ABV and intense this beer is and the alcohol is well hidden other than the warming feeling. Very enjoyable with lots of complexity to the flavors and aromas with tons of contribution from the different barrel treatments.",4.75
Double Double Cask,"So much going on in this one. Boozy, creamy and evolving taste. Bourbon, Cognac, caramel all in a smooth delivery and a clean finish. There may be too much going on but it is an adventure to drink and enjoy.

Taste is unbelievably complex, with layers of roasted grain, whiskey and top notch cognac. Not overly sweet, medium dry, very clean finish, not a fault anywhere. This could easily go with any steak in 5-star restaurant or as an after-dinner finish with the highest quality cheeses, fruits and Belgium chocolate.",4.75
Double Double Cask,"Appearance: Pours a murky burnt caramel color that is clear enough if you look at it carefully; the one finger beige head fades to a ringlet and archipelago while leaving a few spots behind

Smell: The Armagnac puncheon and Rye casks really show their influence on the aroma though there is Bourbon in the fold, as well; the expected Barleywine tones of caramel, raisin, spice cake and vanilla; there is a strong sweet cherry component, too

Taste: The brandied flavors of Armagnac hit the taste buds at the outset, with the cherry, raisin, caramel and spice cake flavors emerging; spicy Rye, vanilla and Bourbon tones emerge, in the middle, with the finish being sweet and boozy

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation; considerable warmth in the gullet

Overall: A lot going on here, perhaps too much, as I don't think the Armagnac, Rye and Bourbon coalesce very well and I would prefer a bit more of a hop presence to balance out the sweet cherry tones - definitely extreme, though",4.0
Double Double Cask,"One thing is for sure, there's booze in this here can. In both scent and flavor, the whiskey character is strong.

EBB night 3, beer 4! The finale! It's quite funny to me how I planned for me and my buddy to drink these box beers together over 3 nights and made sure this one was the finale, pretty much right as al the beers were officially announced. I just wanted something huge to finish off with. Now, I'm drinking what climbed up to the 4th highest rated American Barleywine, and the 93rd highest rated beer overall on BA. That's absolutely wild for a fest-exclusive beer, and I couldn't be more excited to finally try this one. Let's get into it

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is very boozy in the nose, quite sweet for an American expression if the style. I’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar, hot bourbon, raisin, sweet caramel, dark bread, and light vanilla

As I’m sipping this, I think it’s good, but not really as good as everyone else is making it out to be. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dates, molasses, brown sugar, earthy bourbon, vanilla, dark bread, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, earthy toffee, spicy whiskey, vanilla, light rye, raisin, and brown sugar

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry from the booze

Yeah so this was good, but I don’t think it was anything near what it was hyped up to be. I don’t think it was masterfully blended or anything but I enjoyed it",4.25

Super intense dark fruit. Super rich truffles, thick dark caramel, molasses, bourbon. The taste is absolutely crazy. Very very intense. Follows the nose very nicely. Rich toffee, chocolate, bourbon, Armagnac, figs, maple syrup, blackberries, red grapes, port, and a very slight roasted malts note. There is a very faint hint of pipe tobacco, but it's literally 1% of the taste. The best way to describe this is rich and robust. Sweet, but not cloying. The barrel influence is crazy.

The taste is focused on the ripe orange and mango flavors, with some melon and pineapple for kicks. There is zero discernible alcohol, quite impressive for an 8.8% ABV beer.

The mouthfeel features that trademark full, pillowy Tree House mouthfeel that keeps reeling you in for another sip. If you enjoy hazies (and I do), Tree House is your Holy Grail. World class stuff, IMHO.",4.5

A - Dark orange gold color with dense, soapy white lacing.

S - Very dank, juicy orange and mango totally dominate the nose (along with some pineapple). In fact, I could smell this beer from two feet away when I poured it!

T - Follows the nose, and nothing but juicy dankness from start to finish. Juicy and pithy orange, mango, fruit rind, pineapple, and passionfruit from start to finish. Finishes on the sweeter side with some underlying citrus bitterness.

M - Thick, pillowy soft, and chewy.

Emperor Julius,"Ever think you've had too many IPA's and then you find one that makes you realize that you haven't tried everything worth having?

Yeah, this was one of those beers.

One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases. All were solid, as was this, was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family. Poured like orange juice, felt like orange, juice, and had possibly the best head and lacing that I've ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet. Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste. Loads of dewy forest, dank hops, apricot, stone fruit, turbid orange, and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same. So smooth, so fun, and so easy to fall in love with, this had a nice body, hints of wheat in the taste, and went down *way* too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste.

I have no idea how this was 8.8% ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun. Dated 8/24 on the bottom of the can with ""IT IS YOUR DESTINY"" written above it, the Star Wars reference was fun, just like the rest of this outstanding brew. Use the force, or whatever it takes, to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years!",4.5

Nose is a wonderful hoppy orange, peach and mango. Taste follows nose with the flavor muted a bit compared to aroma. Just enough bitterness to balance the beer, but not bitter as a sister beer like Juice Machine. A nice hop flavor rides the taste to an easy finish.

Very good mouthfeel and carbonation is perfect making this one dangerously drinkable given its ABV, which is felt but not tasted.",4.5

Look: Pours a hazy light yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a while leaving lots of lacing. Some floaters visible.

Smell: Fresh tropical fruits, especially pineapple, mixed with some citrusy notes of orange and tangerine.

Taste: Quite contrary to the smell, citrus notes are dominating here with tropical pineapple and mango in the background. Medium sweetness with a slightly bitter, minimally zesty finish.

Feel: Fresh, juicy and quite full. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Full and fragrant pale ale that tastes somehow exactly as you‘d want a double dry hopped 6.8 ABV version of Pseudo Sue to taste. One of the best pale ales I‘ve had and quite rightly a top ten beer in this category.",4.5

Double Shot,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours jet black with very dark, but quickly dissipating, head. The nose is intense vanilla, as advertised. Additional notes of coffee, chocolate, marshmallow, and malts. The taste is fantastic. A great mix of vanilla, roasted malts, coffee grounds, and dark chocolate. Some toffee is mixed in there, along with some dark fruit. Wow. Intense indeed. Lovely stout and very happy to have tried it! Mouthfeel is thick and viscous.",4.5
Double Shot,"“Stout season“ stamped on the bottom of the can

Oh man, I’m so happy to be here. I’ve been waiting so long for Tree House to re-brew straight up, OG Double Shot. This has been (and is still) the highest rated American Stout on BA for quite a while, I’ve had it marked as a want for nearly 3 years. So, let’s get into another world class Stout

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of dark mocha head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

Oh man, the coffee is so forward in the nose, but there’s still a decent anount of that TH Stout-sweetness still. I’m picking up on aromas of spent coffee beans, espresso, chocolate fudge, caramel, toasted nuts, brown sugar, and light raisin

In taste the sweetness is mostly up front, and it starts to dry off into a slightly more traditional Stout on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting coffee candy, milk chocolate, brown sugar, toast, vanilla, sweet bourbon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of spent coffee beans, fruity coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, brown bread, raisin, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice roast character

I gotta say, with this newly brewed version of this beer being at 8.2%, I didn’t really think it would be a true American Stout. And is it that? No, not really, but it still retains some old school characteristic, and it’s just damn good regardless. I’m happy to have made a trip up to Tree House mostly for this beer",4.25
Double Shot,"Sent to me by the one and only @ovaltine whose beer prowess is so amazing he can get fresh Tree House stouts in Indiana.
Poured deep dark, not exactly black but darn near. The head was as dark a brown as I have seen on a beer, the one knock was the head didn’t stay long.
The aroma, mostly I just get vague impressions of aromas as I foolishly didn’t wear a respirator when working with some nasty chemicals. Every once in a while I get more, and those are treats! This one gets me coffee and roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla. Mostly coffee, but wow it’s all in there.
The taste followed, coffee leads and filled the spectrum at first, only swallowing allowed the roasted malts and bourbon (bourbon soaked Madagascar vanilla beans, who knew?) and the vanilla sneaks in last. I enjoyed every sip and it was gone too soon.
The feel was excellent for the sipping nature of this beer, soft almost, counters the nearly bitter coffee presence.
OA, thoroughly enjoyed this beer and now I want to go to the brewery for a vacation. Sadly, my partner said no. If I wanted to stay married that is.",4.5

Tree House Brewing
Date: 18 June 2021
This is the last Tree House beer; I have in my Fridge. Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights.

Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing. Dark roasted malts, toffee, molasses, a hint of smoke, a touch of char, and tobacco. The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas.

One of the strongest coffee-flavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale. The molasses, caramel, and toffee tempering out the bitterness. This created velvety coffee flavors. The dark roasted malts give some char, bready, and earthiness to the beer. I detect

The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and bold.

The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a robust finish.

The coffee flavors in the beer are rich and flavorful. One of the best coffee beers I have consumed in a long time. A must-try for any coffee stout lover.",4.5
Double Shot,Fantastic.,4.75
Double Shot,"Pours dark and thick, huge mocha foamy head that lingers. Super sweet coffee and chocolate aroma with a touch of boozy Esa to it.

Double Shot,"On tap @ The Festival 2014. Black pour with a small layer of tan foam. A lot of rich, spicy coffee on the nose. Slight vanilla and caramel sweetness. Roast, cocoa powder, and a mild nuttiness. Flavor has a moderate bitterness of coffee, roast, and cocoa. However, a nice sweet balance to it. Plenty of caramel and dried blueberry. I liked this more than the maple one.",4.0
Canuckley,"#131, yummy!",5.0
Canuckley,"A: Asphalt highlights to an obsidian pour that’s oily in circumference. The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn, of a penny toned rim. Thus, not much room for retention, which is limiting on lace entanglements. A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat, for slightly etching the windowpanes

S: A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence. The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins, as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs, of a sickly shrewd growth. Namely, a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness, as malt creams the humid agilities. There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs, while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces. Meanwhile, a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle, which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin. Subsequently, a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy, besides the smoked-dry turfs

T: The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance, as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee. Howbeit, liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets, while conveying angles to figs & plums. Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions, which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears. In succession, a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread, for Scottish tablets, amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan S'mores. There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature, while dabbing at coniferous pine needles. This element further stretches across birch & paperbark maple, given a sharp (resinous) bite to kick-off the epilogs. To that end, a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide, while citing a slow-burning chimney fire

M: Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness, and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute. In doing so, the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness, by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness. There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong, but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco. In parallel, a touch of acerbic tannin throughout, which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean & dry cessations

O: A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the (semi-stick) extracts. A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects, while bourbon perimeters all of their showpieces",4.25
Canuckley,"Brief Review:

O: Highly rated beer here from Transient, from my home state. Just got through Kentuckely, which I thought was just okay. Surprised to see such high ratings for this beer. Kind of a competitor to CBS, but with extra maple syrup and vanilla added. Gets a little muddled because of that for me. Little boozy and hot as well. It's a decent beer, I just wouldn't say it's that well balanced.

Recommendation: One of the better Transient beers I've had, but maybe not world class just yet.",4.5

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Who says that you can't have brunch at night, or that you can't have one on Tuesday? Kane Brewing's pick-me-up and put-me-down Imperial Porter means that you can have that Sunday brunch anytime you'd like.

Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a near-black appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee. Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple, bourbon spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel, candied coconut and vanilla.

And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust. dark roast coffee, walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream, and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak, coconut, peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts.

Full in body, the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat, suggared espresso bean, except with a hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate.",4.25
Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2020 bottle, slight improvement on an already great beer.",4.5
Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours dark and a bit on the thin side. Thin head fades quite quickly. Big maple syrup aroma, followed by chocolate and coffee. Barrel aroma is faint. Tastes like the original Sunday Brunch, with an additional depth to it via barrel aging. Flavor is dominated by maple syrup; cinnamon follows quickly, and finishes with a touch of coffee. Cinnamon adds a gritty dimension to it, and becomes pervasive as it warms. The bourbon barrel treatment doesn’t offer a lot in this beer unfortunately. Just a little extra chocolate and mellowness. Carbonation is light, and it feels thin, has a bit of a tanginess to it. Overall, not an exceptional BA beer from Kane, I expected a little bit more from the barrel program than this.

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Disclaimer: Not a professional beer-rater. Just enjoy a nice tasty beer.

-Enjoying this fine porter on release day (01/25/2020). Poured straight from the bottle into a tulip glass.

-Shallow pour shows a nice brown color. Appears black and turbid in a full glass but the nice brown color remains on the edges. Head is a nice light brown, which died down pretty quickly. Not very much lacing.

-Very sweet smelling maple and boozy bourbon. Those are the only scents I'm getting. Not smelling any coffee really.

-Tastes exactly as it smells. Strong maple and bourbon flavor but that's about it. Would be lying if I said I tasted coffee. Pure bourbon and maple flavor, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it feels pretty different from the original Sunday brunch. One thing worth noting though is that it doesn't taste as boozy as it smells. The alcohol is hidden very well. Would not have guessed it was 11%.

-Mouth feel is near-perfect. Not as thick as I would have expected but surely far from watery. Perfect amount of carbonation.

-Overall, I think this beer is absolutely delicious and deserves its highly acclaimed status. That being said, I would definitely like if there was a bit more coffee flavor to it, as that is one of my favorite aspects of the original Sunday brunch. Is it worth the price? Debatable. But its damn good and I would definitely recommend it to any porter/stout lover. 5/5.",5.0

Twice the Daily Serving: Raspberry,"Canned 11.11.21, opened 11.20.21

Brewers Notes: Daily Serving was born out of our desire to express intense, saturated fruit character in beer form. After thoughtful experimentation with Permutation 6.47 and 6.51, we found that a base recipe similar to the German Berliner Weisse style, with its delicate, yet fluffy mouthfeel and even-keeled acidity is the perfect foundation for robust fruit additions.

For Twice the Daily Serving, we've amplified the mouthfeel, fruit addition, and ABV to achieve our most expressive and luscious fruit beer to date. Brewed with an outlandish amount of raspberries, this beer pours a gorgeous deep ruby red color. Lively aromas of homemade jam, juicy raspberry, and mixed berry fruit leather delight the palate. It finishes full-bodied, slightly sweet, and remarkably drinkable.

L: Inky black pour with a finger of mocha colored head. Solid lacing.

S: Rich and roasty... big time cocoa , coffee, and grains plus bourbon/booze.

Dark fruit and a hint of licorice. Medium to thick bodied... warming... boozy but not as much as expected. Super smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

O: An elite BBA RIS. Fantastic flavor... and a great sipper. One to seek out.",4.25
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Quite a good Bourbon barrel aged beer if anything I guess it could use a touch more barrel character but it really did round out the aggressive hops and roast that the base beer has. Plus I think people are also forgetting how affordable this beer is I picked up a couple cans for under $4 each and that is quite a steal for such a treatment. Sure it may not be 100 out of 100 but it is still a very smooth easy drinking bba stout.,4.75
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2015 Vintage, 12oz waxed bottle

L - Appearance is a deep dark brown, nearly black.
S - Very sweet aroma of chocolate, molasses, and possibly root beer?
T - Not at all like it smells, and I can’t quite put my finger on the flavors. Mild carbonation, and I like it better as it warms. Not at all sweet, maybe even a bit bitter. Root beer? Char? Can’t quite tell, but unlike any barrel aged stout I’ve had.
F - Smooth, creamy, moderate thickness
O - Enjoyed this one because it’s different than any stout I’ve ever had. Def not your typical dessert stout",4.5
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black; creamy khaki head that fades leaving solid retention and lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Some cherries and dark fruits. Mild hints of vanilla. The bourbon is pretty subtle in the aroma department and almost goes unnoticed. The flavors are balanced. More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth.

This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it.",4.0
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2013 vintage
12 oz wax-tipped bottle, into a snifter.

Crude-oil brew, viscous as hell. No apparent carbonation, no head. Nose is anise-forward, with notes of molasses and oak at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are full of licorice and root beer. Molasses, tobacco, hints of coffee and leather. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected given the lack of carbonation. Medium finish (for the style), sweet with lingering residuals.

Wonder is the ‘top secret root’ is sarsaparilla?",4.25
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"From the 12 oz can (!?!) in a snifter. This solid imperial pours a rich
coal black with a very nice head of light brown foam that dissipates
to a thick ring, thin swirling pool, and shows some nice lacing. Nose of
bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark coffee, dark chocolate, balanced char and
roast, and loads of warming, astringent booze. Flavors exceed by a nice
presentation of brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, rich oak, warming booze,
dark chocolate, faint tobacco, dark fruit notes of black and blueberry,
and a nice dash of cream. Nice mouth feel; full body, rich, smooth,
lightly creamy, coating, light carbonation, and a warming boozy finish
with a bitter malt end note.

A wondrous symphony of malt and barrel in perfect harmony!

Black colored body, with an extremely thin dark mahogany back lit edge. 1-1/2 mocha brown head, which settles back to an interrupted cap with an active surface. Leaves a couple of thin strings of lacing.
Aroma of roasted barley malt, dark coffee, and dark chocolate. Has vanilla and sweet bourbon.
Taste has bourbon drenching all the flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark coffee. Has some expression of dark cherry. Chocolate first and then coffee. The bourbon, with its vanilla, cover everything and extend far into the aftertaste.
Seems like a thin mouth feel at first, but thickens as the body is held in the mouth. Slight coating after each sip. Noticeable alcohol burn on the tongue. Supportive carbonation.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bought from bottle craft in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. $8.5 for a 12 oz bottle

A&S: Appearance looks pretty bland. No real head or lacing. The speaks of the head that are there, are brown. The aroma is pretty amazing. Powerful bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, toasted malts, and some coffee.

T&M: Taste is pretty tasty. Slightly bitter, sweet syrup, caramel tones in the finish. Unfortunately, there are some downsides to the taste in my opinion. I have been getting this with stouts for a while now, and I definitely, get it with this beer, but soy sauce is a part of the taste. Fantastic feel. Super rich texture, almost creamy. Carbonation adds a tiny kick, but not enough to take away from the milky tones.

Now, to be honest, I don’t know much about old George; but the fact that he made it to the ripe old age of 100 is pretty dandy in my book. Meanwhile, a beer that’s rated 100 on BA is pretty wild too. Coming full circle, I’m feeling it. Barrel Aged Speedway might not be as cool as some old dude who smoked cigars a good deal of his life and lasted so long, but it’s like the cool dude at your local Elks Lodge who smashes at Shuffleboard and randomly buys you a beer because he’s cool like that.

Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some oak, dark bready and burnt/charred malt flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, coating and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a pretty good straight up barrel aged version of a classic imperial stout, really liked this one a lot!

The nose is of deep sweet malts and barrel wood, coffee, cocoa, chicory... Taste delivers the promise on home, with those sweet malts and barrel leaching, tangy vanillin, brick choco, cooled coffee... not so ""hot"" in alcohol burn... Nice, comforting and appealing feel in the mouth, on the tongue and in the swallow, deep but not overly sticky.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2022 version.
I came in with low expectations compared to their 2020 Anvil and Stave BBA Speedway series. Reasons being : this was available for shipping ( 2020 was pickup only) , this saw very Wide distribution(2020 didn't) , this one cost 8 dollars for a 12oz ( 2020 was 15 for 11.2 oz), abv is 13% which is 1% over regular speedway (2020 was 14.4), They didn't disclose barrel source and not importal but the label sucks.

Smell: single source well made espresso shot with shaved dark chocolate on top, very little bourbon .

Look: looks like an Imperial Stout

Feel: coats the toungue nicely and almost a bit chewy but falls short cuz feels thinner than what i expected

Taste: heres the downfall of this . It tastes lime bottom shelf milk chocolate and hardly has any cocoa, vanilla,tobacco, leather or dark fruit flavors. It has a taste of cheap ass bourbon on the backend of this as well.

Overall: glad i only bought two . This one is a letdown, but i hold their 2020 to be the standard. Save yourself some money and just buy Regular Speedway. Its the same shit.

2020 Release: i rated All 5s.
Updated this for the 2022 release.
2022 doesnt compare at all. What a let down.",3.0
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a mocha colored head.

Smell - The beer had a pleasant bourbon nose. The malts of the beer were also allowed to shine.

Taste - The profile was led by loads of milk chocolate. Bourbon was strong, but not hot or overbearing. The malts were evident as were hints of vanilla. Bourbon became a bit stronger in the finish with just a bit of sting.

Mouthfeel - This was not a particularly thick stout, bit it coated nicely.

Overall - This is a tasty, fairly easily accessible BA stout.",4.5

Double Nelson,"Immense thank you to jrc1093 for this one. I've always wanted to try this little Kiwi bastard.

12oz can - dated 10/06/20 - poured into an ale stem at 40°F.

Pours a fully hazed, but just shy of milky peach flesh yellow, topped with a large finger of off-white foamy head with good retention, leaving a tall collar of lacing as it recedes. No visible effervescence through the haze.

Nose: Instantly recognisable as a Nelson single hop IPA. Green, grassy, herbal notes of cut grass, unripe horned melon rind, lime leaf, white grape, passionfruit, feijoa, lychee, leafy, vegetal wild herbs, unripe pineapple, unripe mango, orange zest, and a peppery twinge.

Palate: As expected, this greets the palate with the same Nelson intensity as on the nose. Horned melon, acidic pineapple, white grape, unripe mango, passionfruit, lychee, kumquat, and unripe melon rind, shifting into some greener notes of lime leaf, lime zest, fresh cut grass, and a vegetal, planty root note - green, and slightly earthy. This shifts into oily, resinous, leafy territory, before taking on a very distinct lime zest note. The beer finishes with this lingering lime zest, complete with a firm pithy bitterness, and showing some pale, flakey malt underneath.

Mouthfeel/Body: For the higher ABV, this drinks wonderfully. All the 8% flavor saturation, but remains crisp, fluid, and drinkable. It still has that soft, fluffy New England texture, but it's never sticky, sappy, or heavy. Effervescence is moderate, but very fine, lending a nice fuzziness. There's that signature racey Hill minerality to it, which compliments a wonderful touch of hop acidity.

Overall: A truly fantastic display of Nelson - so on-point, it almost serves as a Nelson caricature, in the best possible way. Densely saturated, green, leafy, and vegetal, with all the uniqueness inherent to Nelson. The base beer is so classically Hill Farmstead, which only serves to elevate the experience with an impressive display of quality and craftsmanship. Balanced, polished, and refined, shining everywhere you could want a Hill IPA to shine.",4.5

Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency.

Leans too heavy into tropical territory for my taste (think warm pineapple and dried mango), yet still lacks the assertiveness I'd expect in a true IIPA. A bit warmly boozy to boot, lacking in the drinkability department compared to something like Pliny the Elder or Exponential Hoppiness.

Not Toppling Goliath's finest effort, nor is worth its hefty ~$5/can pricetag - but it's a decent brew for what it is. Not better for not having been filtered, for what that's worth.

Overall: Take a World-Class NEIPA and dry hope it. It's going to be what you expect. Absolute perfect haze. All of the same great Citra hop flavors from the original King Sue, but with extra hoppiness. The dry-hopping is detectable. It gives it a slightly extra fruity flavor, but with a pronounced burn/bitterness note from the dry-hopping. The original King Sue drinks like a wonderous and creamy NEIPA. This one drinks like an intense NEIPA that is in your face. Slightly preferred the original. (Rating: 4.34)",4.25
Blåbær Lambik,"Pours crystal clear, dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it? The short answer is probably no, but hell it was fun anyways.

Mild, sharply tart, red fruit aromas of raspberry, cherry; light funk, light lemon juice.
At first the near absence of carbonation is a put off, but there is a very fine, prickly feel, and it ends up doing the job; flavour is appropriately sour, pleasantly puckering, balanced by a light fruity sweetness - like red currants more than anything; have to use your imagination to get a clear sense of raspberry, it's very subtle; there is a faint mustiness and oakiness; long, very dry finish, enticing, lightly sticky.

Give this a chance past the first few sips and you'll be rewarded. Bright and tart, with a refined and subtle effervescence and fruit character - the latter a disappointment for me, as I love raspberries.",4.0

I wouldn't call it overly acidic, more tart and chock full of fruit with lasting tarty raspberries.

Great,"12oz. Bottle served in a Spiegelau snifter. Vintage is probably circa 2014. Pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized apple cider (perhaps a hue darker). Not he, just a thin, broken band around the shoulders. Nose is robust - big hit of figs, followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidation/soy sauce in the background. Taste consistent with nose - figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile. Middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a still carbonation. Overall, a little past its prime. Not much of a suggestion of the barrel; however, still quite drinkable.",4.0
Great,"2013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022

Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.

Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.

Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style.",4.5

I'm back, baby!

Mouth: 5 - thick, chewy, and round. A very well-crafted brew.

Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,"A peanut sized chunk of something floating at the surface in the neck of the bottle was visible before even popping the cap. Upon opening and pouring the beer into a snifter, the chunk remained at the surface which shifted to the bottom of the bottle mid-pour, so I was able to pour the last dregs into a smaller glass where the tan clump plopped out. It was actually hard to the touch as I plucked it from the surface of the beer. My concern began to grow because these Florida pastry stouts usually only have small flakes of more dispersed coconut lipids, which melt instantly and have almost no feel to them. Thankfully, just before my flashbacks of mouse skull chicken McNuggets fully manifested, it did begin melting in the palm of my hand.

Anywho, the body is viscous black with other minor spots of oils surfacing after the burnt mocha blanket quickly disappears to nothing at all.

Smell is Butterfinger with vanilla bean white chocolate and hints of caramel corn. As it warms, charred mocha coffee and brownie crust emerge. The aroma is hypnotizing.

Taste is decadent and a little boozy as the apple brandy barrel makes its presence known, adding sharp oaky liquor notes to the extravagant flavors of coconut filled pâte à choux with chocolate ganache. The body is just thick enough to dampen the barrel to tolerable levels of booze, allowing for additional notes of cinnamon coffee and vanilla custard to surface. The finish is semi-sticky and substantially warming all the way down.",4.5

The aroma is exploding with notes of pineapple, mango, stone fruit, and fresh mixed berries. There's a bit of melon, grapefruit and orange as well.

The flavor follows the nose with loads of melon, mango and pineapple, candied peach rings, blueberry, orange creamsicle, and grapefruit.

The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A little slick and oily. Alcohol is mostly well hidden.

Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,"Poured honey orange - completely opaque and crowned with an almost white foam head ; very nice in terms of NEIPA.
The aroma is potent; and for me that's something. Fruit forward, but instead of heavy citrus I get melon and stone fruit, maybe some light pineapple and the expected hop dankness, though I had to 'look' for it. Almost hidden.
The taste is really nice. For the ABV, way too easy to gulp - I tried not to but a couple got the better of me. Smooth, almost soft, the melon and fruit play dominate roles here, a noticeable malt presence (at least I think that's what it is) and a firm stop by the hops bite before we go into juice territory. Really tasty.
The feel is appropriate to the style and without any 'bits' that seem to be always present in hazy beers. Soft is a word that came to mind, smooth another. Not pulpy, but full bodied. Very quaff-able.

Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,"In terms of haze bombs, this beer is about as attractive as they come. Good head production and retention; excellent lacing. Body is a hue somewhere around mango flesh, hazy but not pulpy, and opaque except in the thinnest portions of the glass.

Nose is bold, strong, and bursting with juicy hop notes. Mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and a slight dankness.

Super juicy on the palate, really delivering notes of papaya and mango - and very little else, but in the best possible way. Moderate bitterness (low for an IPA), and a soft, semi-sweet pale doughy malt base that really amplifies the juiciness.

Near perfect mouthfeel, on par with Tree House (the best in the NE IPA game, in my opinion). Creamy and soft, yet with plenty of bite; high-medium to light-full body, with excellent (dangerous) drinkability despite the high ABV.

The bottle is part of a swap with @Artizen, thank you!
The beer pours a pitch black color with minimal dense tan head that foams up only a little bit even after a very aggressive pour. This minimal foam fades away to the thinnest of edge layers quickly after the pour.
Aroma is dark malt, lots of bourbon, some dark chocolate and a bit of toffee. Fairly sweet and robust, but not really boozy at all and no hop profile shows up.
First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and medium to thick body. The carbonation is gentle, spacious and rolls softly across my palate.
Flavor is what I expect for style and what the nose advertises. I get some roasted malt and toffee with a bit of dark chocolate and a good boost of bourbon note. I also get molasses here and some dark fruit too. Again, no hop character, and the booze is very dangerously well hidden.

There is not an alcohol bite here, but this one is a belly warmer. This is very thick creamy stuff with very light carbonation.

Every sip is rich and full.

Overall, it's a great coffee stout - one of the best, the benchmark by which other coffee stouts are judged. It hits the perfect coffee / stout balance to highlight the coffee without making it taste like you're drinking black coffee and with a rich, dark stout as the base that holds up nicely to the coffee.

Feel: Creamy and smooth with medium body.

Overall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times.

S - Disclaimer. I actively dislike coffee. (Yes, even the smell.) This beer hits with coffee up front, but I knew that going into it and wanted to try a well-regarded beer anyway. Then I get a dark bitter chocolate. There are some oats in there, and finally just a general roast smell.

T - Coffee is first, with some bitter dark chocolate next. I get a hint of a cola flavor. Interestingly enough, the coffee fades and the flavors just smooth out into each other. Then there's a small coffee finish. Absolutely not hoppy bitterness. The only bitter flavor is from the coffee/cocoa flavor. There is a little roastiness in the finish as well.

F - This is a medium feel, but a little thinner than expected from such a dark beer. Decent carbonation. Actually, there is a nice mild fizz in there. Exquisitely smooth.

O - Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.",4.0

§ucaba,"Bottle Date: 2018
Palate Contaminants: other beer, plus a nice fatty cheese

Medium brown color and off-white head. Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long.

First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this.

Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is.

On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.)

At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment.

I need to revisit this one.",4.0

Appearance: Black glass, thin halo of tan bubbles, no lacing.

Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness.

Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.

Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean.

Overall: I love Prairie bombs, I've enjoyed a lot of the variations, this one not so much. I think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer, and it just comes across as a little gimmicky.

Pirate Bomb!,"On tap - this is the July 2019 batch, so 15 months old.

Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing.

Smell is rum and chocolate upfront, with coffee kicking in just a little bit after. The booze is strong on the nose, but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it.

Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should.

Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts.

Overall, quite good. I had a tough time assigning numbers to this one, so I looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts, and eventually decided that I had to give this one 4.25 straight through. It’s not the best, but far from the worst, and very consistent across the board.",4.25

TASTE: cocoa. Coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper kick is just right. Very tasty.
FEEL: full bodied, light carbonation, sticky on the tongue which allows the pepper to linger just nice.

Very special stout. Glad I have 2 more of these to age since in general I've found rum BA to need a bit more time than Bourbon BA to mellow out.

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some burnt/charred malt, caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. It's a little more roasty/bitter tasting than I was expecting, but that's not a complaint by any means. All the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be.

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing

We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.

Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.

MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose
HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans

On tap at Trillium Canton, 5oz snifter , black motor oil , thin dark brown big bubbled layer quickly settles to a ring

And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength.

The vanilla treatment here is nearly perfect - reminds me of something like Vanilla Rye in its prime (not now). It's got that cake-like sweetness with a touch of dried cherry, just super authentic and not at all artificial. The base stout is super chocolatey, with some roast and a touch of coffee like bitterness, with some caramel and oak on top of it from the barrel.

White grape skins as I take a few more sips (makes me wonder if Nelson hops are in the house tonight - wait . . . I see that's not the case, must be the Mosaic and Galaxy hops instead. . . ).

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"A: pours up a murky reddish grape hue, with a quickly receding, white, one finger head.
S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal.
T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins.
M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.
O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.",4.0

It has a wonderful balance of cherry but could use more bret funk for my preference. I probably like the funk more than most people though.

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"Unbelievably huge thanks to Anthony for this massive want of mine. Very excited.

500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F.

Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen.

Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake.

Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry.

Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class.",4.25
XTRA DUBL Benthic,"This was the best of the variance for 2021. While it was very sweet, it wasn’t overwhelming and you definitely could discern all of the adjuncts while getting plenty of paste out and barrel. Amazing beer",5.0
XTRA DUBL Benthic,"Pours jet black, with a delayed yet aggressive dark tan head. Shockingly dense and abiding for having so much coconut.

Aroma is pure sweetened coconut.. and honestly, I am struggling to find anything else. It’s quite overpowering, and while the aroma is very nice, I’m missing the barrel and the coffee to balance it all out.

Oh my god, so much coconut. Sticky, milk chocolate covered coconut candy, coagulated coconut oil, oaky bourbon, espresso brownie batter. It’s a good thing it’s a 12 oz can. Any more and it would be tough to finish. As it warms, it becomes very sweet, and syrupy. Begging for more barrel, but it just barely squeaks through.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s very good, but it’s the definition of “pastry stout.” Pushing the limits of sweet ingredients that you can hardly recognize that it’s beer anymore. A touch of restraint or a tweak in ratios would have done wonders for the beer.",4.5

The flavors are also distinct and intense- coconut, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, malt, some vanilla as it warms. Smooth, an excellent full body, appropriately carbonated.

The flavors are nice, lots of rich chocolate, nice coffee that offers a bit of acidity and fruitiness that draws out some more darker stone fruits. The barrel has a lot of heat, lots of char but offers some toasted coconut, toffee and caramel forward bourbon while being dominated at the finish by alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick, heavy body with a warm and smooth finish.

Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottled December, 2016

Color on the pour is an interesting reddish brown. Once in the glass it settles into a deep, deep brown with just the faintest of red. Almost no head, but a mocha colored ring persists. Excellent legs.

Aroma is rich and boozy. The bourbon / barrel are both there, but so are notes of chocolate, molasses, figs and more. . Very nice smelling beer.

As for taste, unsurprisingly the coffee has faded and I honestly can't even detect it. That said, I'm not sure it matters all that much, as what's still there is great. For my first few sips I was getting lots of barrel / bourbon, but as my palate has adjusted the depth of the beer became more noticeable. Nothing is in your face. The chocolate, roast, barrel etc. are all subtle enough that each sip leaves a slightly different impression.

Nice light alcohol warmth and amazingly full, chewy mouthfeel. Maybe I've given a 5 on feel before, but if so, I don't know when. For my tastes, this has a perfect feel.

Overall, while I wish I'd tried one of these fresh, it's clear that this is a very well-crafted beer that has held up well over time, even without the coffee element.",4.5

Tastes of bakers chocolate, boozy pralines and warming, oaken bourbon among layers upon layers of milk chocolate and accompanying licorice.

Finishes with less roast, more whipped cream covered milk chocolate and a light dryness, resulting from burned malts and a more pronounced coffee presence.

The medium-light body has a crackly carbonation and finishes semi-dry. A mild but complex and mature barrel heat brings peppery char and caramel.

There is a good balance of sweet and tart citrus, including the aforementioned lemon, grapefruit, orange/tangerine, and pineapple, and notes of ripe melon but the malt provides a rich, earthy backdrop from the oats and wheat. Others have commented on the hop burn but I find the bitterness to be clean and manageable. The mouth feel is terrific: rich and fluffy with appropriate carbonation, and the 8.5% ABV gives it good substance without overpowering. Overall, I have a feeling that this can is past its prime.

Aroma brings fresh orange zest contrasting a musty lime undertone, with prickly resins and underripe mango building to candied grapefruit as peach fades atop a boggy subtext.

Taste offers ripe, waxy white grape sporting a tinge of honey upfront as notes of papaya and musty agave graze the mid-palate; subtle moss enlivened by orange zest on the back end culminates with fleshy peach trending into jackfruit density on the closing impressions.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation dispersing a taut prickle into an otherwise creamy mid-palate, where resinous grit lingers to a silky back end and balanced finish sporting a subdued bitterness.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a deep, opaque chestnut-brown with an explosive three finger head that slowly compacts over the next 4, 5 minutes into a nice thin white cap. These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet.

Both strong and gentle, complex, and boozy aromas swirl in the glass. I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.

As with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.

Body leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker. However, the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip. Long finish, this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet. Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation, it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced. That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour.

It’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel, Quadrupel, Dark Belgian. We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada, and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades (or even longer). If you’re reading this, I know I don’t really have to convince you. This is good. Really good. Foundational stuff. When you see it next, grab one for you and one for your cellar, you know you will not regret it.",4.5

Poured a warm dark walnut stained mahogany color and was crowned with a beige head, albeit briefly. Almost looked too pretty to drink.
Aroma wafted politely and was full of dark fruits (Figs, raisins, dates) and sweeter stuff like caramel and toffee. The taste followed, with a few spices that held it back from the cloying sweetness stage and balanced this so ideally I couldn't think of much to improve upon.
The date on it was about 4 months out so I suspect it was 4 1/2 years old. Still wonderful. Now I have to taste a fresh one!

T - Some alcohol in the front along with the malt. Slight chocolate, possible cola. The dark fruits and port wine are in there as well. Good complexity overall, so that each taste can find some slight variation

F - Nice high carbonation with a full frothy mouthfeel.

O - Overall, this is an excellent beer. Well deserving of it's high ranking. The complex taste of malt, dark fruit, and everything else is a pleasing experience. I highly recommend this beer and will keep purchasing it in my annual rotation.",4.75
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Appearance: Dark brown, frothy khaki colored head with excellent retention.

Aroma: Malty with strong dark fruit aromas, hint of alcohol.

Flavor & Aftertaste: Immediately warming, alcohol is noticeable. Caramel, pepper, spicy, plum & raisin. Mild bitterness.

Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied, effervescent, drying

Overall: Excellent Trappist beer. Has the characteristic champaign-like effervescence. Malt forward with darker fruit flavors, caramel. Spiciness is prominent and pepper. Good medium to full body mouthfeel. Has some balancing bitterness, but it is barely noticeable. Alcohol is noticeable, quite upfront, but it is 11% ABV. It is amazingly drinkable for a high carbonation, 10% plus ABV beer. Found no flaws in this one. Have to give it a 5 for being a world class Trappist beer.",5.0

Scent is citrus and tropical fruit. Soapy and floral. Papaya, guava, pineapple.

Taste is muddled tropical fruits. Citrus. Pineapple. Mangoes. Malt presence is constrained to a light pretzel note. There's a minty green note also.

Mouth is creamy with a nice weight to it.

This is a very impressive beer considering it is 3 months past its BB date. I can only imagine how great this must be when fresh.",4.25
Pseudo Sue,"This is pure, unfiltered, and unimaginably delicious beer. 16oz can poured into a snifter at 50F. Opaque hop slurry looking like a glass of orange juice. Head is white, like soap suds, that just hang around the entire time, leaving mountains of lacing on the sides of the glass. Total hop slam to the nostrils; full on dank citrus. Taste is a spectacularly hoppy mess, with a consistency like orange juice, but with hop pulp instead of orange. Good lord this is amazingly hoppy, and full bodied, with very little alcohol to be found, as it is masked by the hop insanity. This is a pale ale? So says the can. Did they accidentally can a bunch of King Sue in the wrong cans? Nope. Picked up a 4 pack of each, and this Pseudo Sue might as well be a solid single IPA when compared to King Sue. Overall one of the best beers I have ever had.",5.0

Look: Pours a pale golden color with a lot of floaties that eventually settled. There was a nice, fluffly white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. The beer became a lot hazier after pouring the bottom of the can.

Smell: Has a pronounced citra hop aroma - lots of grapefruit peel, orange, grassy, with green bell pepper notes on the back end. Smells peppery also and has subtle cantaloupe notes also.

Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose. Strong grapefruit flavors with a moderate to high bitterness on the finish that lingers but does not overpower the palate. It's very drinkable. I think that the flavor filled out a bit also after pouring the bottom of the can.

Feel: Has light to medium body, nicely carbonated.

Overall: Solid single-hop pale ale. To me, this toes the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Personally, I would probably put this closer to IPA territory than pale ale, but I can see both opinions. Regardless, it's very delicious, highly drinkable, and accessible.",4.0
Pseudo Sue,"One of the better Pale Ales out there. Has a very nice hazy appearance with light fruity tropical smell. I like the taste of the citra hops, juicy and mango citrusy flavor.

The body is medium, moderate carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.
Altogether this is one tasty and enjoyable brew that I would place somewhere between a NEIPA and a pale ale but it is outstanding, whatever. I already want more.",4.5
Pseudo Sue,"Simply put, this is a very nice IPA. It’s single-hop Citra, which is unusual in todays world. It’s hazy, but not extreme. It’s fruity, but not overly fat and sweet. Balance is the right word. I normally don’t line hazy IPAs very much, but this one I actually line a lot. A classic, had several gallons of this over the years, drank it again after taking a 2+ year break - it is still very good, I like it a lot. Did I mention: I’ve got a thing for Iowa. That might have played a role, too.",4.0
Pseudo Sue,"Pours a hazy gold.

Light and inviting floral and citrus aroma.

It tastes surprisingly juicy on the tongue, with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Mild hop bite and malty sweetness behind.

Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Overall a great beer. It’s less sharp and more balanced than Zombie Dust or similar Citra APAs, but quite flavorful. And light enough to pair with spicy food.

Poured from a can dated one month ago.",4.25
Pseudo Sue,"Appearance: Cloudy straw orange, fluffy white head, very good retention.

Aroma: Hops forward. Citrus notes of oranges, tangerines. Tropical fruit.

Flavor & aftertaste: Citrusy & tropical fruit hops flavors. Restrained but balancing bitterness. Medium sweetness.

Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Light to moderate carbonation. Medium length finish with trailing bitterness.

Overall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus & tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking.",4.0
Pseudo Sue,"Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA.",4.25
Pseudo Sue,"Pours a cloudy, strawberry wheat color with a white foamy head that hangs for a bit. Some nice lacing surrounds the glass as I sip.

Smells of citrusy hops and a touch of tropical fruits.

Tastes great! Very refreshing.

Mouthfeel is solid. Light carbonation with a nice viscosity.

Overall a solid brew. Haven’t been able to get this in our area until a few years ago and took a long break from reviews. Picked up a 4 pack to try. Worth the wait.",4.75

Abrasive Ale
Surly Brewing
Imperial IPA
Date: 17 Dec 2021
Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent.
Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal.
Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank.
The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers.
This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.",4.0
Abrasive Ale,"Pours a light chill haze pale yellow, nice white head laces very well.

Aroma is fruity citrus deep pine resin, nose is good but not in your face big double IPA like.

Taste is definitely big on hop resin scrap your tounge bitterness. Lingering pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Flavor is just tropical fruits and citrus. Maybe I'm just expecting more dinner is world class, it isn't bad but eh not world class atleast for me.

Mouthfeel is nice and almost full the oats really help with the mouthfeel.

Overall a solid big IPA.",4.25
Abrasive Ale,"This was a wonderful throwback IIPA, with a heavy dollop of bitterness along with the grapefruit, melon, and tangerine hop flavors.

Abrasive Ale,"This is a lovely looking brew. Golden liquid with a considerable amount of haze. Firm white head with a decent size, good retention and lots of lace.

Nose is a delightfully malty, hoppy and enticing combination. Malt has lots of toasted grains and light sweetness. A light bit of sharp alcohol is the only hint of the abv. Hops are healthy and dank. Tropical fruits abound. Citrus cuts across and makes it quite hop forward.

Taste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor.

Feel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch.

This is a such a great beer. Quenching and easy drinking. You could fool yourself into seasoning it until you fall on your face. So tasty and satisfying, I can go for another, and another, and another,",4.5

It pours a rich, bright, medium golden color. Has a slight smidge of haze, but it's mostly clear. Carbo is steady, though the head is a thin layer of fine white foam, with light lacing. Has a nice aroma, with tangerine, pineapple and pithy grapefruit all present and accounted for. Body is medium to medium-plus, and it passes smoothly over the tongue.

Taste is more on the sweeter side vs. bitter.... Has peach, tangerine, pineapple, a hint of honey, a smidges of guava and passion-fruit. Has some subtle bitterness in the finish, though it is predominantly semisweet. Solid and tasty! Prosit!

BDCS,"Bringing a little heat to the party, Ozark Beer allows for an extended aged Imperial Stout to bring all the bourbony warmth that would ever want to be inside of a beer.

Dark and tawny garnet brown, BDCS '22 hits the glass with an ominous looking pour with a dainty trickle of foam for decoration. As a bourbon laced scent of dark roast coffee, caramel, maple, chocolate and toasted nuttiness lays across the nose, the flavors open up with a sweet heat of coconut, chocolate, molasses, vanilla and caramel.

As the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze, the flavors of espresso sets in with baker's chocolate, roasted walnut and campfire to follow. Interrupted by the barrel, the flavors soon dominate with the strong oaken, toasted wood, weathered barrel influence with savory heat and bitter spices to close.

Full bodied, full flavored and laying on the tongue with a heated glaze, the stout finishes both hot and sweet with a linger of savory heat in a long lasting afterglow.",4.0
BDCS,"12oz can, tulip, 2021 vintage.

Oily, almost black, and nearly still. There is a thin head that’s quite dark brown.

Hershey’s syrup, vanilla, rich bourbon, some soy sauce, and it’s vinous, with overripe red grape and fruit. The bourbon isn’t over the top, rather it’s woody, rich, and elegant.

Ok, now that fat juicy grape bursts and mixes with melting chocolate bar, blackberry jam, walnut, and strong vanilla in the finish. The chocolate is a backdrop, weaving together Hershey’s syrup, dark chocolate Milky Way, and cocoa powder. The grape flavor is surprising in its strength.

Very smooth, medium bodied, light and discrete carbonation.

The flavors are intense and rich even though the body isn’t super rich. The bourbon is well done.",4.25
BDCS,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a dark tan head. Little carbonation was visible.

Smell - The nose was just like chocolate marshmallows. It was big and sweet, signifying a sugar bomb.

Taste - The taste was not as sweet as the nose. It was chocolatey bourbon with a dry grape presence. There were notes of leather and coffee. As it warmed, I was made to think of hydrox cookies, and their dry chocolate notes. This was definitely not an overt dessert stout.

Mouthfeel - There was just a bit of carbonation and a slick body.

Overall - A solid barrel aged stout that left me confused about the hype.",4.25
BDCS,"Sent by the very generous @jvgoor3786 in a recent box of goodies. I poured from the 12oz. can into a 12oz. snulip glass.

The pour is slick dark brown like used motor oil. It leaves a small layer of creamy tan foam in it's wake. Smells like bourbon, char, ripe dark fruit and molasses. The taste is very bourbon forward followed by dark roast/coffee, burnt brown sugar, fine tobacco. There's a slight sweetness that offsets the bourbon that is wonderful. The feel is oily smooth with noticeable alcohol warmth.

It's been a spell since I've had a straight up barrel aged stout that wasn't overwhelmed by pastry ingredients. This reminds me of the early Bourbon County and Black Note years. It holds its own and brings a pleasant plethora of sensory delight without being overwhelming. This is the closest I've come to rating a 5 in a long time.

BDCS,"2020 vintage (released in 7/2020); consumed on 2/1/21

Pours an ink-black body capped with around a finger of creamy, pale mocha foam; decent head retention yields a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a minimal amount of spotty lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur.

Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics.

Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV.",4.25
BDCS,"2020 vintage opened on 11/22/2020

Pours a think used motor oil color with minimal coffee crema head. Nose is of barrel and vanilla, roasted malts, milk, minimal umami/soy.

Overall, what a nice treat, great base beer that is exemplified by the barrel.",4.5

BDCS,"L: Black as pitch brew. No light passes even at the fringes of my Firestone Teku.
A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing.

S: Soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews I’ve encountered. This aroma is offset by burnt sugars, sweet molasses, dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew. More vanilla as it warms.

T: Follows the aroma mostly, but tends sweeter than I’d hoped for. The sugars mask the complexity found on the nose.
Still quite good. Impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste.

F: Highest mouthfeel rating I’ve given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best BCBS years. This one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup, sticky, oily, and creamy. It is lighter weight perfection. You must experience.

O: I didn’t set out for a verbose review, but while so many BA Stouts fall short of my local Fremont’s, this one came outta nowhere with its complexity and simultaneous subtlety! A stellar brew on the nose especially, which deserves to be tried by stout-lovers the world over!",4.75
BDCS,"Immediately upon popping open the tab on this one I can tell I'm in for something rich and delicious. A dark liquid pours forth, Nearly jet black with a tight but creamy soft looking rich brown espresso head that lingers and lingers. Beautiful sticky lacing as well. This is gorgeous.

Nose is again big. Creamy and slightly nutty with a seeming wood influence to the dark coffee and light spice notes. I'm getting a decent amount of creaminess as well as nuttiness, so could this be a stout with hazelnut or perhaps lactose? Smells more like nutty creamy (erm...) than lactose creamy, at least to start.

Oily and dry and a nice high point of carbonation that helps usher the whole thing along. What it ushers in is cocoa/bakers chocolate and some further light cream. I'm leaning milk stout here, with a nod in the dark toasty side of things. Me likes. Almost kind of a coconut husk kind of thing with the nuttiness I was noting on the nose.",4.0

Flavor is just massive. Tons of candied pecan, figs, bourbon, maple, milk chocolate, vanilla and chocolate wafers, candy shell, caramel roll, and molasses. All wrapped up in a bourbon blanket.

Impermanence,"Excellent head production and good retention. Overall, an attractive beer.

Tons of maple on the nose; it's definitely the dominant characteristic, followed by coffee and the rich malt base. I don't get much chocolate standing out from the malt.

Flavor is more balanced: up front, it's a stout, through and through. The maple doesn't take long to show its presence, but it's a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose. This is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate. The result is more in line with a breakfast beer (a la Maple Bacon Coffee Porter) than a dessert beer - which seems to be the goal, based on the description.

Maple, wood, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, cream. The flavor really grows; I wasn't blown away by the first sip, but I'm liking it more and more.

An easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness. While the maple winds up being the star (as so often is the case when adding maple syrup), it's still a pretty well-balanced beer, with plenty of bitterness. It's very approachable for a beer verging on double digit ABV. It lets you know it's pretty big, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it.",4.25

A: Murky Arnold Palmer hue with 1-finger foamy white head with below average retention and spotty lacing.

S: Blasts of lemon, lime, guava, mango, peach, grapefruit, and orange with an herbal, honeysuckle note and a bit of malt sweetness. Esters are moderate and candy-fruity in nature.

T: Unapologetic flavor assault with lemon, lime, guava, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, and definite notes of honeysuckle and marijuana in the late palate and aftertaste. Esters are a little lower in intensity in the flavor but add the same candied fruit notes as the aroma. Bitterness is low-medium and alcohol is well-hidden. Delicious hazy IPA.

M: Medium-bodied with more dry finish than most NEIPAs.

Congress Street IPA,"Looks like watered down orange juice with opaque body and a medium collar of white bubbles. Nose is vaguely citrusy before a swirl. After, I get a punch of OJ when I first did this. Later attempts paired that scent with some floral tropical notes and an earthy bitterness.

First taste was earthy and very bitter, but that seemed an anomaly after a few more of them. It remained a bitter beer, but some balance returned. After some sips, the earthy to dirty nature wasn’t completely shook and firmed the base. Hints of grapefruit and orange rind act as lead-ins to pine in the form of both wood and dark green needles.

The evolution of this beer isn’t much, it’s pretty straightforward earthy and bitter to my palate.",4.0

Taste - The taste was initially pretty mild with notes of papaya and mango. The profile shifted to bitter lemon rind and pine notes. A light bready backbone was present. In many ways, it was like drinking liquid lemon rind. The bitterness of the lemon lingered. This tasted like a take-no-prisoners west coast IPA.

L -- Ruby red with total clarity and a soft pink head

DFPF,"This beer is one which truly lives up to the hype. At times beers like this gain a cult-like following without having the commensurate quality, but here that is far from the case.

The taste exudes the balanced fruits, and the mouthfeel is thicker than the beer itself, but not too thick where it becomes overwhelming or chewy. It is still thin and refreshing. I have had this on draft, in bottles (19 and 20 releases) and have loved every sip of it. It is well-blended and balanced, and a refreshing and enjoyable combination of tartness and fruitiness.

I love this beer!!",4.5

Midnight Still,2020 version poured from a bottle into a snifter. This is nicely thick with a strong fudge flavor.,4.5
Midnight Still,"Poured oily black with a brown head. Most of the head disappeared pretty quickly, but coated the edges of the glass like the ring of a solar eclipse. Aromas of leather, pipe tobacco, coconut pudding, black cherries.
Flavors are rich, with a ton of dark chocolate, oaky bourbon, and charred marshmallow.
Mouthfeel is full, and the dense carbonation smooths it out. Finishes dry with dark chocolate bitterness on the palate.",4.25
Midnight Still,"2020 vintage (released on 2/14/20, so presumably bottled within a few days of that date); consumed on 2/4/21

Pours a glossy, motor-oil black body topped with a barely-formed, mocha head, quickly fizzling to a spotty array of paper-thin islands of cap, expansive, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of short-lived, webby lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma expresses dulled notes of brownie batter cut with boggy ethanol as a slight black raspberry accents upfront; dark chocolate, caramel, and touches of pipe tobacco develop sparingly against a core focused intently on rawer bourbon tones and distinctly wet oak barrel; some molasses and burnt brown sugar factor in toward the back end, as well.

Taste bursts intently with waves of silky drinking chocolate, refined and creamy while leveled with a slight nuttiness; molasses progresses as the bourbon character deepens, forming notes of caramel brittle, burnt marshmallow, and brown sugar over the mid-palate as coffee bean meets bittersweet, malty char on the back end; a slightly smoky, ashy char finishes.

Mouthfeel brings put a fluid medium body elevated with a timely, fluffy burst of carbonation rounding into a silky grit over the mid-palate; heavy roast expands on the back end to counterbalance a growing bitterness with ample char, while a slightly sticky character gently coats the palate into an otherwise moderately dry finish.

From initial impressions of muddled heat and subdued malts, a level of forward, confident brilliance is expressed in equal parts sweetness and roast; the final product is an amazing flow of enveloping character, seemingly unending in its influx of intrigue and detail despite any apparent shortcomings.",4.25
Midnight Still,"2020 vintage - split with jrc1093 because wowweeweewoah what a champ he is.

Pours a seemingly fluid deep midnight black. A very minimal dark mocha head recedes fast leaving a persistent bubbly collar. The beer clings to glass, draping down and staining it brown. Oil spill.

Nose: Aroma opens very strong and saturated. Notes of bourbon-soaked brown sugar, drippy molasses, burned soft caramel, English toffee, demerera sugar, encapsulated by very heavily charred oak. The roast lends some milk chocolate, cacao nib, and a deep burnish character. Some bramble dark fruit and current highlight brightness, with ethanol fumes are quite apparent, and paired with this densely musty, sopping oak character, detracts from the otherwise rich depth.

Palate: Waves of rich, silken, malt-driven fudgy roast, caramel, toffee, cacao nib, burned brown sugar, and molasses lend an initial sweetness that is rich and decadent, before an almost unrealistic degree of flame-charred, bourbon-soaked oak barrel comes in and cuts it down quickly. Big burly bourbon notes, with toffee, coconut, pipe tobacco, vanilla caviar, and an almost bark-like tannin structure. The barrel and roast overtake the sweetness, and pair together for an exquisitely lengthy finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: Shying away from the thick, vicious, chewy theme, Midnight Still manages to deliver all the fudgy richness from the malt, with the sweetness fading by the finish, and replaced by dense, oily barrel. A nice fluidity allows it to remain drinkable, without ever approaching cloying, surrounded by a soft, fluffy carbonation.

Overall: There's so much going on here that seems so unique to this beer. This is not a replica of another - it is not a waxed Bourbon County. This is a beautifully seamless execution of balance between malt complexity and full-on bourbon barrel assault, with the only real thing dragging it down is the ethanol and musty earthiness in the aroma. This is one for the books.",4.5
Midnight Still,2020 Edition. Bourbon Milky Creamy Delicacy.,5.0
Midnight Still,"Had this Sep 3, 2016 as part of corpulent's birthday jam. Drank this at that golf course I can't remember the name of up at Lake Tahoe.

Has the requisite 'used motor oil' kind of pour in viscosity and appearance. Aroma went hard on the bourbon and ashtray. Behind that you had some chocolate like fudge notes and an even smaller vanilla quotient.

Once again, bourbon dominates the taste, but it manages to push one of the biggest bourbon portfolio's without being too boozy or by eliminating all other beer aspects. As if KBS was less coffee and chocolate but more bourbon. Drinks smooth while still being able to drop some smoke and ash notes the whole time. Hint of dark fruit creeps in as it warmed up on the back 9.

I don't necessarily think this is better than the all time classics of barrel aging (KBS, Eclipse, BCS, CW), but it can definitely hang with them. Would be interesting to see what the score for this would be if it were a lot easier to acquire, I imagine a little bit less, but not significantly. It is top notch.",4.25
Midnight Still,"Novare Res Stoutfest 2020.

A- Oil black pour from the waxed bottle into a snifter. A small nutty brown foam layer appears on top of the beer with decent retention leaving spotty lace.

S- Bang on balance of roast bittersweet stout and decadent sticky, aged distillery basement and oak bourbon barrels. The Bourbon alone is unreal, peppery spicy sticky booze and fruit notes. Fudge and rich cocoa balanced perfectly by boozy whiskey. Roast barley. Hints of vanilla. Truly Bourbon mastery.

T- No arguing that the Bourbon is the star of the show but there is enough malt character to balance to near perfection. Bitter roast barley and fruity dark chocolate bars, french roast coffee beans, pepper, vanilla hints, brownies, boozy edge, caramel, oak wood degradation and nuttiness. Again it tastes like Buffalo Trace's sticky sweet bourbon barrel house. Strong oak bourbon malts but all pretty balanced, just HUGE.

MF- Thick and slick oily monster. The booze tames the hefty body quite a bit finding a nice middle ground. Slightly creamy and chewy. Ends warm.

The Bourbon barrel character in this beer is basically unmatched from what I have come across in the last ten years. A great surprise to be able to drink this brew in Maine and one of the best beers I have had in quite some time. Hopefully can visit this brewery again some day.",4.75

Susan,"From a single tallboy (brought back from a NE vacation by a buddy), canned 6 weeks ago, into a La fin du monde tulip. If this is what 6 weeks out tastes like, what must it be fresh? Superb construction: gentle but full layers of tangerine, passion fruit, with an incredibly soft mouthful…next to no bitterness, but there is a kind of malty thickness that adds to and also restrains the fruity juiciness.

First beer I’ve ever had a chance to try from HF, and I wish it wasn’t an NEIPA, but even so, damn.",4.5

Susan,What can I say. It's perfect.,5.0
Susan,"Can dated 8/30; best by 9/27:
Loved this beer originally two weeks ago, but these had on the best by date aren't jumping out at me quite as much. I actually do not think it's because of age, just my palate being a little different when I did this review.

That aside, this is still a very good IPA, especially if I am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge. The look is a quite highly hazed, near but not 100% opaque. As with many HF beers, the head and lacing are pretty strong.

Nose is a mix of tangerine, grapefruit, and some form of sweet fruit - I want to say a little pineapple. There's a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me, but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste.

Medium heft, maybe a little less, with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges. More citrus rind and fruit - tangerine, orange, and some sweet ruby grapefruit, with a little huskiness from the barley and/or other grains. Not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose. The back end is bitter, but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it. Bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part, the latter keeps things from getting out of hand. As expected, a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience.",4.5
Susan,"Pours a fairly hazy yellow-light orange. Wonderful passionfruit and orange hop flavors on the nose. The palate follows through with plenty of citrus and tropical hop flavors. A very refined, well-crafted beer where everything just works.",4.75
Susan,"Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma has notes of tangerine, orange marmalade, grass, dried vegetation and a slight woody character to it.

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange, orange marmalade, and peach giving way to a grassy, vegetal, woody hop character on the back end. Clearly the Riwaka are coming through on the back end. Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, completely delicious. Feel is moderately bodied, smooth, and pretty easy drinking. Moderate carbonation.

This is a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead - they get so much out of the hops both in the aroma and taste, its impressive.",4.5
Susan,"Very, very attractive beer. Burned orange in color, but what really stands out is the gorgeous head. Dense, foamy & long lasting with extensive lacing. Aroma has lots of citrus & tropical notes, with orange being what jumps out at me the most.

Taste has more of the tropical / citrus notes with the hops working well together. The orange detected on the nose is not present on the tongue, although some hints of grapefruit do come through. Amazingly full mouthfeel. Good beer.",4.25
Susan,"Had this beer on tap at the Mule Bar in Winooski, Vermont, just outside of Burlington. Excellent! Another good one that day that is not listed here was called ""William"" and that was superb also. This is obviously a top class brewery, worth visiting the next time we are up here.",4.5
Susan,"Appearance: Pours a rather cloudy orangeade color with a two finger head; solid persistence and streaks of lace

Smell: There are both grassy and floral tones here, with stone fruit and lemon in the mix

Taste: The flavors here are subtle but bring an interesting spectrum; stone fruit and passion fruit are featured, with a lemon aspect; the bitterness builds nicely but is held in check so that it doesn't overwhelm

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation

Overall: A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts; not saying it doesn't belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tasting",4.5
Susan,"Received from a friend in exchange for a collection of Equilibrium DIPAs/TIPAs...

L: beautiful, rich golden maize color with a 3/4"" of thick head that dissipated after a few minutes. Somewhat opaque, owing to the unfiltered packaging.
S: some clean, piney wafts along with a noseful of citrus and sugary-sweet hops (maybe the Riwaka?). Very appealing.
T: bright citrus scent on the nose makes its way down but is quickly subdued by dank and slightly bitter (WA state?) hops that make for a really interesting APA.
F: mild carbonation, very quaffable. Hop bitterness lingers nicely.
O: a near-perfect rating for good reason; this is a great take on a classic variety that has been overshadowed by the new shiny toy (NE/hazy IPAs). Fantastic beer.",4.5
Susan,"Canned 6/8/21. Drink by 7/6/21.

L: Pours a deep orange with a fluffy white head that quickly dissipates to a thin film. Beautiful lacing.

S: Orange, peach, apricot. None of the dirty socks aroma that sometimes comes with Simcoe.

T: Follows the aroma up front, then pivots to grapefruit in the middle. Finishes quite dry with just a slight bitterness.

F: Super soft mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation.

O: An outstanding IPA. The aromas and flavors are subtle but distinct, and the mouthfeel is sublime.",4.5

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Good head production and decent retention. The body is wonderfully dark, as is the dark brown head, while it lasts.

The aroma on this is powerful and decadent. From the moment of the pour, to sitting in the glass feet away, I'm getting strong notes of chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Up close, it's even sweeter, with vanilla, syrup, honey, and brown sugar joining the mix, along with cinnamon and chilies. The nose is, quite simply, wonderful.

Despite the sweetness of the nose, the brew is quite roasty and bitter up front. Light but noticeable pepper heat. Tons of dark fruit flavor, blackstrap molasses, oak, and bitter chocolate; slightly vegetal. Lasting prune and raisin, along with bourbon, on back third, leading to chocolate and cinnamon on the finish.

Thick and full bodied.",4.5

Vintage 2021

A: Pours midnight black and somewhat viscous in appearance. Immensely dark head of 1plus fingers width dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves only a few patches of lacing. 4.75

S: Aroma is, my god. Massive cinnamon, big chocolate, vinous dark fruits, luscious bourbon, capsaicin peppery heat, red wine. Barrel notes are moderate in strength and compliment the beer wonderfully. Some base beer notes primarily roasted malt. Fire roasted marshmallows rounds it out. Goodness gracious. 4.75

T: Taste is also excellent, albeit perhaps a bit less voluptuous. I again get huge vinous and red wine notes up front, hell is actually tastes like it’s red wine barrel
aged. Next comes the cinnamon and rich, fine high cocoa content dark chocolate. On the finish there is roasted malt, charred oaky bourbon notes, some balancing bitterness. This is just wave after wave of flavors and it’s quite frankly just impressive. 4.75

M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. ABV is not noticeable which is impressive. Drinkability, however, is quite limited. The combination of the heavy/thick feel and adjunct laden flavor profile make 500mL of this feel like 3 gallons (and this is coming from someone who drinks Bourbon County all the time and even old school 750mL Black Tuesdays without any trouble). 4

O: Overall, this is quite the beer. Normally beers this adjunct heavy can be not really my thing, but this one just pulls it off wonderfully. Probably more appropriate as an 8oz pour as opposed to a 500mL solo bottle, but still, well done Cigar City, well done. 4.5",4.5

Nose is sweet peach, citrus, grass, melon and grapefruit. Melons along the lines of honeydew and cantaloupe. Very nice cornucopia of fruits. Nice sweetness with a good balance of grassy hop presence.

Taste is similar. Peach, citrus, and melon, and a relatively strong weed dankness that wasn't as present on the nose. Also it could just be a phantom effect but I get brief moments of raspberry. Medium bitterness, almost reaching something on the higher side of what you'd expect on a NEIPA. mild to medium hop burn as you drink, building on the back of the throat. Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence.

Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation. The hop bitterness and alcohol level, makes this brew feel a little more harsh and bubbly than it actually is.

Heavy Mettle,"Poured from a can dated 2 days ago (fresh!) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch.

S: that classic, seductive 3F geuze nose. Pleasant bit of barnyard funk to open, with some bright fruit notes quickly behind. Slight cheese, assertively but appropriately acidic - on the fruit front, granny smith apple, bit of lemon flesh, some white peach. Some chardonnay grape as well. Great mix of bright fruit and complex, earthy funk

T: great swallow, delivers a nice mix of fruit and sour with bright acidity. Slight pucker at first with notes of green apple, bright and pronounced citrus. That lemon flesh character from the nose comes through well here, pleasantly sharp and leads into the medium-long finish. That more cheesy barnyard funk is more toward the finish, leaves this great lingering note with a rustic baked bread flavor as well. Flavor dances nicely in that unique way, really nice

F: medium- body, medium+ carbonation. Nicely drying, that bit of tart that suggests a nice sip

O: wonderful and tasty geuze. Bright acidity and pleasant, complex funk; solid fruit character, big fan",4.5
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,"Bottled 11/2/20 750ml
Consumed 12/30/21

So excited to finally try this bottle that I got in a trade from Belgium. We're finally seeing a bit more 3 Fonteinen in Chicago with them dropping Intense Red and Homage in mass recently. It's a very pretty lambic. A medium hued peach in color with nice carbonation and lacing that stays around. I don't get as much off the nose as I would like while it's cold but the flavors jump out more on the tongue thankfully. As it warmed the lambic funk started to come through. There's so much happening flavor wise here. Tartness is medium to medium high. I wish there were a bit more funk but it's present. It recognizable as a 3 Fonteinen beer immediately to me. The feel is superb with the carbonation and dry finish. Overall I don't know if it's my favorite 3F, but it's up there. Worth picking up a 2nd one if you can get 2.",4.5

Oude Geuze Golden Blend,"L: Golden/orange with a touch of haze, thin head, and little lacing.

S: Honey, flowers, apricot, a touch of vinegar. Funky notes intermingles as well, some classic Brett barnyard character. Bready malt.

T: Very tart and tangy, apricot, honey crisp apple, honey, and some citrus flavors. Some bready malt on the finish, but stays fruity and sour the whole way through.

F: Moderate body, fine carb but nice crispness. Dry finish.

Overall: An absolute pleasure of a beer. Not super sour either, even for a vintage from 2018. I highly recommend this to any fan of the style.",4.5
Hommage,"Pours a pulpy red hue - kinda a dull garnet type of color. This is honestly one of the uglier lambics that I have cast my eyes on. Aroma is quite fantastic, a combination of raspberry jam with the slight mustiness of a kriek. It's got jammy raspberry with some overt tartness. There's also an underpinning of chamomile. They say don't meet your heroes and often times with beer, it feels like you are set up for disappointment when you have a highly sought after and/or highly regarded beer. This is a true icon of the lambic game and rightfully so.",4.5
Hommage,"Felt an appropriate day to open this, given the news of Armand's recent passing. Ruby red in the glass with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are balanced between raspberry and cherry pie filling, with a nice lemony acidity from the base lambic. Flavors are tart, a bit less fruity than expected, with more of a raspberry character. Overall I like it, although not quite as much as Framboos

85/100",4.25
Hommage,"Two year old bottle.

Beautiful strawberry color in the glass, completely transparent if decanted - darker and murkier with the yeast, however, nearly completely opaque. I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians (for health, of course), but I'm not holding that against the appearance score. Pale pink fizzy head, brief lived, leaving the body completely still.

Extraordinary nose: tart and fruity, but equally funky, earthy, and sharp. Earthy, dirty, mushroom-like funk; raspberry and cherry; oak and must; a great example of the oft-mocked ""horse blanket.""

The palate has less earthy funk, but it's still there, especially on the back half. Up front, it's a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegar-like sourness. Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish.

Strongly sour, more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics, owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries. Mouth puckering; lingering sourness about the gums. Swishing, swirling, and chewing is almost dangerous. There's no vinegar burn, however.

This is world class, but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness, it would be among the best beers I've ever had. As it is, it's easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world, different in character from Cantillon, but just as good. Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age.",4.75

Pours deep, medium-hazy red with a finger of off-white head.

The nose is raspberry, cherry, lemon, and vinegar.

The taste opens with medium-sour lemon, vinegar, and green olive and finishes with raspberry and cherry. Very low sweetness and medium tartness. The initial pop of vinegar and green olive is somewhat off-putting, but the beer becomes more balanced and fruity as it warms and my palate adjusts.

The mouthfeel is medium for the style. Puckering tartness with a clean finish.

Hommage,"Bottled on 9/18/2013 - consumed on 7/18/2021. Poured from a caged-and-corked 375mL bottle into my Drie de Fonteinen tumbler.

Cloudy cinnabar body supports a thin layer of very pale pink foam which dissipates to a vague collar pretty rapidly; poor retention, no legs.

Intensely, flamboyantly aromatic - suffused with bright berry, cherry, and fine aged red wine vinegar notes. Wild and complex.

Bracing acidity, with pepper and mild cheese notes quickly overwhelmed by tart fruit. Perfectly blended lambic with nuts, peppercorn, wildflower, honey, and foraged greens emerging occasionally beneath the raspberry and barnyard notes. Some minerality but not too many tannins in the finish, which while dry, isn't puckering.

Milky, smooth mouth-feel - could do with a tiny bit more carbonation perhaps, but it isn't bad for the style.

A fitting tribute - one of the best examples of the style I've had in quite some time.",4.5

Saison Bernice,"Brief Review:

O: My first SARA beer here, very lucky to grab this from SF on a trip this past April. Been hearing a lot of great things about them for years. Really digging this. Very clean, light, complex. Just a slight funk, not overly tart. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Don't have much to compare it to from the brewery, but as far as saisons and wild ales go, this is certainly top notch.

Recommendation: Definitely on par with some things I've had from HF, this is a really good beer from an awesome brewery.",4.75

Taste: Light sour, tart, and funk, stone fruit, apricot, peach, citrusy notes, lemon zest, orange peel, vanilla, peppercorn, floral.

Mouthfeel: Creamy beginning, smooth, medium to light bodied, with moderate carbonation, and a dry finish.

Overall: Really smooth and enjoyable. Just so easy to drink with its great aroma and flavours. Wish it was easier for me to get more.",4.75

Attractive hazy yellow color with a medium amount of fluffy white head, a thin layer of which lingers for some time.

Poured nearly black, which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. Still, capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing.
The aroma was bourbon, and that’s about it.
The taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but I couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. Not sure if if it “aged out” or something, but I never found it.
The feel was excellent for the flavors, bourbon is a sipping drink you know.
I am glad to have tried this, but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible.",4.25

KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"I warmed to this beer slowly, but it's now easily my favorite KBS variant, as well as my favorite stout from Founders overall. Title implies the stout may be sickeningly sweet, but there is nothing excessive here. It still tastes like beer, not a dessert, and it makes for a great sipper. And contrary to some comments made by others, I found the stout thick, like a few stouts that have been condensed. As for price, I've become more accepting. I would not be willing to pay $8 for a 6 oz pour at a bar (unless I was already drunk), but paying $5 or $6 per 12 oz bottle seems an acceptable transaction. (As for the ""hazelnut"" variant, I'd rather a few Guinness.)",4.75
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"Pours a thick dark brown with a tight, small cappuccino head.

Big aroma on this beer. Sweetened coffee, chocolate. Some maple as it warmed. A little indistinct booze.

The taste follows, but fuller. Creamy sweet coffee. Milk chocolate. A hint of maple. Alcohol.

Body is on the thinner side despite the rather thick looking pour.

This is a great variant of the original, a beer I like quite a bit. Given the choice between a KBS and this, I might choose this one.",4.25

S: Decadent chocolate fudge, some coffee, roasty earthy notes, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, and faint oak, and hints of toasted coconut.

T: Big chocolate fudge runs the show up front, followed by coffee, vanilla, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, a touch of maple, roasty earthy notes, and faint hints of toasted coconut and oak.

M: Medium to full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth, alcohol is nearly completely hidden, crazy drinkable for a sweet 11%.

O: The second I heard about this beer it topped my wants list, so it's nice to finally dive into a bottle.
I really grew to appreciate this one the more it warmed and opened up. It's a big sweet dessert stout, the first few sips make that very clear, and they absolutely nailed the fudge factor. It's also surprisingly easy to drink for something so big and sweet, which I came to realize is due to the solid foundation of coffee that kept peeking out more and more as my glass emptied.

Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13.

Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut.

Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting.

The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable.

Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV.

I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!",4.5

Aroma is a complexity of funk, fruit and oak. The funk is musty and hay-like, the fruit is remindful of green apples, and the oak adds to both the slight sweetness and the tannins.
Taste is also complex, and sour in tone. The mustiness comes through in the funk notes, and the fruit has green apples that add to the sour tone. Big oak underlay. Rather quick to disperse and dry. The fruit funk lingers.

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Frustrated. Lost my review three damn times due to page crashing. Now this will be a short review for a phenomenal tasting, which is annoying.

Pours a honeyed golden orange. No real head to speak of, but a nice white ring surrounds the glass.

Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it. Fruit notes of green apples, pears. Funky notes of general barnyard stuff, hay, some musty notes in there as well. Somewhat of a vinous smell, generic dark wine grapes here. Some wooden and oaky aromas. The smell is not an unrestrained Brett/super barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap, and it’s not sour vinegar-y either. It’s even mildly sweet.

Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour. Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here, I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression. Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself? That kind of oily flavour is here, but it’s miles more gentle. A little bit of wheaty notes here as well, like some damp, whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something. Vinous character at times, like generic white wine grapes. It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours, and yet all of them meld together on each sip. It’s more like, on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in. It’s pretty remarkable all things considered. Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour? I might just be shooting blanks here, but it feels like it. There is not, well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this. But there is this kind of umami flavour to it. Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt, that sort of body. It’s not oily, particularly, because the sourness makes it more tart than anything. It’s really hard to nail down this character, especially as it warms and it comes out even more. Thankfully… I have another in the cellar!

Definitely sour, but not a puckering sour. There is even a mild sweetness. It finishes pretty dry, and surprisingly, finishes quite clean as well. No lingering sourness on the palate. Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness, which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried. Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip, the carbonation is not particularly biting. Medium bodied.

This is my first real Geuze. I’ve had plenty of sours, but not a Geuze as of yet. And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces. This is not that. This is balanced, restrained and yet complex. For what the style is, it feels like an absolute benchmark. I am by no means an expert in this arena, but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker. My bottle was bottled early 2018. Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it. I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so! Can’t wait to revisit it! To tide me over until then, I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next!",4.5
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Pours a foggy, hazy burnt orange with a half finger of white fizzy foam. Head bubbles away quickly. Aroma is peach and apricot for fleshy fruits, but not overly juicy. It adds just a touch of initial sweetness. Stone, grass, and oak round it out. It has a slight tart funk to it, but is not 'sour'. Acidity remains balanced, and low. Flavor profile is stone, oak, grass, herbal, peach and faint apricot. It leads with that heavy stone, grassy, yeasty character, with a little build up of fruits at the finish. Tartness remains light or faint, offering just a touch of dynamic at the end. Acidity is low. Mouth feel is still in effervescence with just a little sparse pulp for any additional texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a sublime lambic that packs elegance into every sip.

Notes of tart green apple, white grapes, oak, dirty laundry, and a zippy lemon character.

The taste leans into the funk without as much of the tartness. There are notes of green apples, apple, lemon, some bleu cheese notes, strong oak with some mellow white grapes, wet blanket funkiness and some dry tannic notes. I feel like I get something else every time I take a drink of this beer. At times its funkier, and times it more fruity and tart, then it is drier and leans into that chardonnay like character. The complexity of this is amazingly balanced by a drinkability I have rarely found in these geuzes. I could actually envision drinking this all afternoon rather than just a single glass - although my heartburn would undoubtedly make me regret that. Still, this is a beautiful beer - complex, yet approachable.

The feel is medium bodied with bright, vibrant carbonation. The tartness in this dances up to the point of being puckering without ever actually reaching that point. It is definitely a drier beer especially on the back end into the finish.

Overall its a remarkable beer - delicious, complex, challenging, yet oddly drinkable. A fitting beer to carry the name of Armand Debelder",4.5

Bottled 10/12/2015

A- pours a clear golden amber color with a one-finger foamy white head that has good retention

S- bright and fruity nose with aromas of ripe pear, green apple, lemon peel, orange marmalade and white grapes. Plenty of funk undertones provide aromas of oak, barnyard funk, wet hay, fermented apples, leather and cracked pepper

T- fruity notes of ripe pears, green apples, lemon pith and citrus zest up front, followed by a backbone of funk, providing notes of hay, lemon tartness, yogurt and some barnyard funk. The finish is fruity and funky, with notes of more pear and lemon, funky linger

S: Funky, mildewy old dried hay, with sourdough biscuits being baked nearby, and some moldering orange peels.

T: Sharply tart underripe citrus opens, with a soft metallic tinge. That quickly segues into a swirl of sour white grapes, vinosity, green apple, and rancid honeydew melon, with a grass and mildew undertone. Old wood and pollen manifest by the finish, the aftertaste of which lingers as tart sour orange with mold and metal.

Double Stack,"Beer #1600 on BA is another beauty.

Brew #8 from the Hop Culture Juicy Brews box, a 16oz can poured into a glass coffee mug.

A: Moderately thick black pour; certainly dense and opaque but not the thickest stout ever. Capped by a creamy mocha head.

S: Delicious, decadent, rich coffee and maple syrup character. Chocolatey notes as well. The coffee isn't acrid or bitter, just smooth and rich and plays well with the maple syrup sweetness.

T: Yeah, so easy to drink - this is literally my wheelhouse. Just enough sugary maple syrup to be rich and decadent without being cloying; roasted malt profile bolsters up that sweetness, and the fresh coffee shines through with a breakfast-y feel to it.

MF: Again, not the biggest stout I've seen or tried but big enough, and the body stands up to the adjuncts.

O: Just delicious and darn near perfect for a maple syrup coffee stout.",4.5
Double Stack,"Appearance - The beer poured a brown-ish black color with an off-white head crowning the pour.

Smell - Maple syrup stood out in the nose but there was some bitterness to lend a sense of balance.

Taste - The maple was huge, complemented by a dry bready backbone. A bit of charred dark coffee lent a sense of balance. The sweetness fades in the finish leaving a light coffee bitterness.

Mouthfeel - The body seemed a bit thin for a sweet stout, but it had stickiness.

Overall - The nice thing about this mapled stout was that it was not too heavy.",4.5
Double Stack,"Brownish black with two fingers of brown foam. Smell and taste are clones: huge maple syrup from the local diner with coffee bean, mild chocolate, brown sugar and molasses. Reminds me a lot of Mikerphone's imperial SLBS extra maple variants. Feel is lighter and not syrupy at all though, roasted and malty if anything, amazing given the huge maple presence. Would love to try this in a barrel! A classic that is worth the hype for a great maple fix without saturating the palate with sweetness",4.5

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Big 750ML bottle that’ll make quite a crash in the recycling bin. Split with my wife. Because I’ve had my sugar quota for the week.

Lab black, little to no head. Smell like an Oompa Loompa is holding my face inches from a small pond of chocolate. Overwhelming.

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout is sweeter than my Grandma (no, not really, nothing sweeter than Gen! Plus, she made killer buns). Wow. The cocoa. And this from a confirmed chocolate addict. All the chocolates. Vanilla shows after a good spell of warming along with a smidge of coconut. No toast. Nothing to offset the ridiculous sweetness. Full, big, but a small sample of this would have left me content. 75 minutes in & not half done.

The barrel aged version was superior: the bourbon & oak seem to have cut the overwhelming sense of being trapped in a silo of raw sugar. Good but would be much better in small quantities.",2.5

This did not disappoint.",4.75

Smell - In the nose, the cinnamon lead the way with modest sweetness.

Taste - In the profile, coffee led the way. Cinnamon came in second place, and it was not overdone but gave a nice element of spice. I struggle to find a vanilla notes and the barrel profile was mild. The coffee and cinnamon carried to the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer had some viscosity, allowing the main profile to linger.

Overall - This one was a bit of a letdown for me.",4.25

Fresh and hoppy nose, but a bit of a melange of citrus, tropical, and herbal aromas, with little in the way of individual notes to pick out. Pineapple, mango, tangerine, cream; little else that triggers anything. Still, it's a very pleasant, if not particularly complex, aroma profile.

Very juicy on the palate, with tropical notes leading the way, carrying a more restrained citrus edge and some herbal bite. Mango, papaya, pineapple, basil, oregano, lemon zest, mandarin orange. Orange creamsicle finish.

Smooth and creamy bite; top notch in the style.",4.5

Thicket,"This one is really thick (unlike that loser Robin). Yeah, this one is like pure and ripe like the day Bridgette Bardot was born. For reals, it’s just beautiful and it hits you well and good like Bruce Smith trying to make you fumble.

Hut! Hut! Hike!",4.5
Thicket,"Blend No. 2 (2018 release); consumed on 1/14/21

Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass.

Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close.

Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish.

Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product.",3.5
Thicket,"Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F.

Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance.

Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant.

Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry.

Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins.

Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing.",4.0
Thicket,FFBL draft. Holy sour blackberries! This is what a sour is. I enjoy the thick and gloopy fruited stuff but this is a real sour. Tons of lacto on the nose and in the flavor. Nice blackberry flavor with a lot of sour. Puckering! Great fruited sour here.,4.25

Thicket,Super sour with nice berry flavors coming through.,4.5
Thicket,"Dark maroon to purple with a short mauve head that loudly fizzles out to nothing quickly.

Taste is super juicy blackberry, to the point of gummies, while dark oak and tannins come in mid-palate, capping off with only the faintest hint of nutty funk in the exhale.

Thicket is really puckering and tingly, yet somehow not painfully acidic at all. A playful effervescence runs thru the medium body coming to a just semi-dry finish.

Bomb!,"Simply a perfect beer. First the history- Prairie Bomb! changed the alcohol laws in Oklahoma to open up the door for higher alcohol content beers and a wave of new craft breweries. The complexity is incredible. In this style it is so hard to hide the alcohol content. Prairie does this well. Slight chili taste in the end keeps it from tasting too sweet. Also stands apart because of the carbonation. Slight bubbles, small head are a delicate balance which is also hard with this style. Appropriately named, this one will sneak up on you. Best beer from the best brewery in Oklahoma. Period.",5.0

Tastes great. The chocolate and vanilla play nice and Satan sends a small heat spear on the tongue and back of the throat at the finish. Balanced rolling flavor profile.

Moderate level of head, which is medium brown. It recedes into a beige ring at the edge of the glass. Nearly black and opaque, which pours somewhat thickly. Sweet tinged, heavily toasted grain/wood and chili pepper on the nose. Not very sweet, smooth caramel and toasted wood flavors, with the added chili, cocoa, coffee and vanilla bean, blending into a subtle and singular note, which is really well done and probably not very easy to balance together and not become the main flavor component of a beer.

Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters). I may have picked up some mild chili peppers in the first taste, but not after that. Mouthfeel is rich and fairly smooth, but with a little alcohol ""bite"" as befits the high octane.

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Lift Bridge Silhouette Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. 2014. Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.

(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.


I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)


Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.

Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.

Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.

It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!

Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season.""",4.5
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle.

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).

Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers.

It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.

So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.

Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).

Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.

Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.

Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.

The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).

Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!",4.5

Smell- Very fragrant, black currant, tobacco, plum, blackberry, black cherry, brett, oak, black licorice.

Taste- Black currant, black pepper, brett, plum, blackberry, black cherry, transitions during the sip from sweet/sour to just sour.

Feel- Between medium and full body, very mouth watering upfront, highly dry at finish, soft, silky, sour finish, moderately mouth coating, below average carbonation.

Overall- Highly complex beer with an abundance of flavor and a powerful bouquet. Nice balance of plum, black currant, blackberry, and black cherry made for a wonderful experience.",4.5
Consecration,"Received via NBS BIF #13 from @Jayorear.
Poured brown with tints of red, the beige head grew to about 1 cm and settled to a thin film leaving no lacing.
Aroma had red wine vinegar and, oddly, red wine (I mean, how do they get both of those aromas to come through?)
The taste, wow. Oak, funky red wine vinegar and, at the edges, dry red wine. Faint but unmistakable. The flavors play off each other in every sip.
The feel is medium with very active carbonation. Fits well with the flavors.
Thanks Jay, this was amazing!",4.5
Consecration,"Re-reviewing this one (7/1/2022) now that I have an additional decade of beer tasting experience (and, consequently, several additional pounds) under my belt.

375mL (bottled 7/12/2021) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber/mahogany with almost zero head, lazy carbonation rising from the bottom.

Aroma is acidic and vinous, tart and bright. Bready caramel malt, oak, apple cider vinegar. The yeast is clearly doing the heavy lifting here.

Taste is likewise sour and fruity with lots of red wine character. Oak barrel, wild yeast, clean malt, tannins. Complex and delicious.

Mouthfeel is crisp and light, hiding the relatively high ABV. Finishes clean and dry, super refreshing.

Overall an excellent, well constructed wild/sour ale. Seems pretty straightforward but it’s one of those beers that is deceptively simple. Clearly a great deal of skill and artistry went into producing this. It’s reputation is well deserved.

750mL bottle (batch 003X3) poured into a snifter. Pours a clear mahogany with minimal head, champagne carbonation. A ring of bubbles forms around the edge of the glass.

Aroma is tart cidery funk w/ bright notes of sour fruit and oak. A slight solvent aroma lingers.

Taste is tart, sour, oaky and fruity. Lots of wine notes, really dry on the palate. Almost a combination of a lambic, cabernet, and champagne. Really interesting beer to pick apart; complex.

This is not a beer I would drink every day, but definitely worth revisiting once in a while.",4.5
Consecration,"375ml bottle, tulip, bottled 2/26/20.

There’s a little fizz as I pour, but my attention quickly shifts to the eye catching dark amber liquid. It has a viscose appearance, bubbles move slower, like a hardening piece of amber, and there’s a notable lack of foam.

It’s funky, naturally. Lacto sourness, copper, and the currants come through with their gamey, deep fruitiness.

Moderate tartness before moving on to a schmorgasbord of funk, leather, barrel, dry red wine, and those delicious little berries.

Light body, practically no carbonation, and just a little slick.

When I picked this bottle up last year I was surprised I hadn’t had Consecration. It’s just a super well done beer.",4.25
Consecration,"Brief Review:

O: So this is my first time with any of the RR sours. Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods.

Recommendation: I mean, yeah, it's an RR sour from the -ation series, you gotta try it. Just don't go in expecting to get your mind blown. Hopefully the next two I have are better.",4.25
Consecration,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99. Bottled 7-12-21; consumed 5-3-22.

Beer poured a red wine color with a fizzy carbonated head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is cherry and strawberry forward and red wine barrel that gives a touch of leather.

Taste is a wonderful balance of leather, red wine vinegar, cherries and strawberries, finishing very clean with each sip.

Mouthfeel is light and delightfully smooth.

Overall a really well executed beer!",4.5
Consecration,"Bottled 7/12/21

I’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it

Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather

Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%

Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall",4.5
Consecration,"Reddish brown liquid, off-white, slightly pinkish head that diminishes quickly. Dark fruit and oak fills the flavor profile, derivative of the Cabernet aging. A slight tartness like red wine vinegar, but also currants and berries. Delicious and complex, as the flavors unfold from first taste to finish.",4.5
Consecration,"I've had this beer since 2011 and it's from when they were still doing batch numbers rather than bottling dates.

A: Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass
S: Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel.
T: Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity. Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak.
M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out. I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience.",4.75

Another sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present.

The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical.

The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky.

The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish.

This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!",4.25
Consecration,"Pours a deep amber with a cream colored head.

Sour and sharp with notes of leather and tobacco rounded by floral and wood.

Sour, leather, tobacco, up front with notes of citrus & lime. A sharp sour punch, finishes dry and woody",4.0
Consecration,"What else can you say about this? Lively, funky, bright, full flavored, complex, refreshing... This is a great sour ale with a beautiful amber russet color. Carbonation is moderate and provides nice effervescence. The taste follows the nose perfectly with currant and bretty funkiness. So easy to drink at 10% abv. No real rough edges here. An excellent beer that few would find controversial.",4.75

Truth - Vanilla Bean,2/6/21,5.0
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Pours onyx black with a dark brown film atop, which results in a small layer of lacing at the rim of the glass.

Aromas on this are defined by complex flowery and spicy vanilla, bakers chocolate and lighter molasses among a well accentuated, toasty, oaken barrel.

The beer’s mouthfeel is rich and decadent, smooth and heavy with a fitting lower carbonation, which manages to develop a late effervescence, leading to a pleasant refreshment.

Tastes of milk chocolate, spicy molasses and toffee, together with a warming, weatherbeaten, yet elegant, sweet and flowery appearing barrel. Got an earthy coffee bean dry- and roastiness going on, gently balanced by lots of soothing whipped cream and chocolate cake. Finishes with a warming, sweet spiciness, lingering, licorice accompanied vanilla bean and more chocolate among an evenly spicy, yet toasty maintaining barrel dryness.

This got an A+ balance to it with a truly fulfilling mouthfeel and a well working adjunct, establishing a nice interplay with the prominent barrel in this. Well done!",4.25
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"31 May 2021 - Beer #245

Price: $18.00 at the brewery

It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup.

The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup.

Appearance: 4 - definitely black, but poured a bit thin. Not much head.

Nose: 5 - oh my. No explosion in the nose, just smells very well blended and not too sweet.

Taste: 5 - hmm, really interesting. Not too much vanilla. The barrel really hits on the back end.

Mouth: 5 - much thicker than expected. Supremely smooth. Incredibly well crafted.

Overall: 5 - okay, I wasn't blown away. Could have used more vanilla, but I'm nitpicking.

Cheers!",5.0
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"This is probably only second to Good Morning in terms of stouts from Tree House. Luscious vanilla bourbon goodness that coats the tongue.

Seek this out if you can!",4.75

Truth - Vanilla Bean,Full bodied...rich feel...sticky lace all over the glass...huge vanilla scent and flavor...mild barrel character and ridiculously smooth. Abv is there...a sure supper.

Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Drank from a 12 oz. white wax dipped bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a Tree House teku

Viscous, complete pitch black appearance. The dense, oily looking body was capped by a small film of coffee colored bubbles that quickly dissolved. A thin, lasting ringlet encircled the liquid.

The aroma was a bit underwhelming initially but improved dramatically after a few minutes. Fresh vanilla bean came through strong. Good amount of sweet, sticky caramel and toffee pudding notes too. Moderate bourbon presence. As the beer warmed, both the bourbon and the vanilla really intensified. Dark fruits were also apparent.

The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super rich, malty and robust. Nice roasted and caramel malt presence on the front end. Loads of fresh vanilla bean too. Moderately sweet. Dark fruits were detectable in the center. Bit of chocolate fudge as well. Bourbon barrel notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the finish. More lingering boozy bourbon, vanilla and sweetness after the swallow.

Outstanding mouthfeel. Rich, creamy and full bodied for the style. Super oily and dense on the palate. The liquid contained a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence that turned super frothy and smooth. After a few sips, the beer deposited a sticky film on my lips.

Tree House’s Blend Two was a big disappointment, but Vanilla Bean Truth definitely lived up to the hype. The fresh vanilla bean notes were intense but not overwhelming, and the bourbon presence was punchy though not overly hot or boozy. I hope these guys continue to releases more barrel-aged bangers like this.",4.75
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"I wish it had a bit more vanilla and roastiness on the nose, but the flavor is so exquisite that I forget all about it. It’s rich, vanilla frosting, creme brûlée, dark chocolate and finishes with oaky barrel char bitterness. It’s silky smooth, like all Tree House stouts, and there is no boozy burn. It’s the best Tree House stout I’ve had.",4.75
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Lived up to expectations. Perfect blend of a fantastic tasty stout with just the right thickness and sweetness. Vanilla is just noticeable to bring great balance to the marshmallow and bourbon taste. The bourbon is noticeable from sip one and comes alive with that awesome bourbon burn on the tongue more and more as it warms - but never overwhelms. Always smooth, always a great mouth feel. Can’t wait for the next TH BA release.",5.0
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (after 25 minutes of fucking with the wax thank you Tree House) into a stemmed harmony glass. Gotta keep it classy..

The pour is pitch black with a 2 finger effervescent milk chocolate head. The head quickly dissipates into a blanket of creamy foam. Doesn't leave any lacing but looks gorgeous after it settles.

The aroma brings notes of earthy oak, sweet bread, bourbon and vanilla before a wave of dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits.

The flavor is definitely stupid. Lots of bourbon and vanilla on the front, followed by a tidal wave of milk chocolate, dark chocolate fudge, chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, caramel, sweet bread, and roasted coffee. There's some subtle notes of fig on the back. Wow.

The feel is about what you'd expect: Full-bodied and chewy as hell, creamy, syrupy and full of booze. One of the thickest beers I've ever drank. Ridiculous, but also extremely difficult to finish even a 12 oz pour.

Overall, this is the first BA stout I've ever had from Tree House, and...the 2nd they've ever brewed (not certain about that)? Regardless, it's pretty much what you would expect if you love TH stouts as much as I do. The bourbon is strong but never comes close to overwhelming the other flavors. Incredibly rich and full. The price point is hard to justify but it's absolutely worth trying if you can.",4.75
Permanent Funeral,"From a 12oz bottle, aggressive pour yields a foggy amber color with a big frothy head that faded to a cap, leaving some nice lacing.

Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass, this beer featured a hazy but bright apricot color with a big foamy white head. Head retention was excellent and there were thick bands of foamy lacing on the glass. Aroma was strong and pleasant, mostly floral, aromatic hops and sweet caramel malt. Flavor was more of the same but with great bitterness and piney hops overtaking floral hops. Great balance between the rich sweet malt and the strong piney bitterness. Outstanding flavor.

Permanent Funeral,"Can dated 10-04-2021

Appearance: Fairly cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. Nothing to change here.

Smell: Moderate pine aromas and mild sweet fruity aromas. There is a bit of malty aromas also present.

Taste: Some sweetish malt notes first show up with some faint pine notes followed by a blast of hop bitterness. The beer has that sweet taste i typically get when IPAs/IIIPAs hit 10% or more ABV. The beer has a fairly sweet initial taste which dies off with some lingering bitter hop notes.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.

Overall: A good IIPA but too high in ABV for my personal tastes for an IPA/IIPA. I just find the malt sweetness a bit much in hop centric beers over 9.5% or so.",4.0
Permanent Funeral,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 10/04/21 Q0433""

Appearance: It has a murky orange and gold body with some shadows that are just barely visible through it. The head is large, thick, and white. The head has a consistency of whipped cream with tapioca-like bubbles. It has very good retention and lacing.

Aroma: There is a light floral aroma with what smells like a dusty orange hard candy. As a whole the aroma is pretty muted but ok.

Taste: The flavor kind-of mimics the aroma; up front there is this orange flavor which is slightly floral. Towards the middle it picks up a light pith character and a bit of sweet malt flavor. It finishes slightly floral.

Mouthfeel: Carbonation feels great. The beer has a medium-light pithy hop bitterness. The body is on the lower edge of medium and smooth. Drinkability is high.

Overall: The flavors and aromas seem good but they are a bit muted in the beer. The can states that this is a ""ALC 10.5% BY VOL"" and it does a phenomenal job of hiding the high alcohol content. The beer mostly tastes like a somewhat sweet orange hard candy which is interesting. It isn't the best example of an Imperial IPA but it is still worth drinking due to the high drinkability.

Permanent Funeral,"Picked this up at Hy-vee in Owatonna Minnesota. No canned on date.
Appearance: Pours a golden yellow orange color and fairly opaque with some visible sediment. Almost 3 fingers of snow-white foam. Great head retention and lacing down the glass once the foam dissipates.
Smell: Initial notes of pine and citrus including grapefruit and orange rind. Lighter melon notes are also present with tangerine and apricot. Caramel and cracker malts with a prevailing bitterness. As the beer warms grassy and flowery notes become more prominent as the beer warms with an accompanying dankness.

Taste: Holy Hops! Bitterness jumps out the glass and assaults the tastebuds. On the back end there is a pronounced overwhelming sweetness that really destroys the complexities of the malt backbone. Its hard to make anything out besides pine and grapefruit in the first few sips. More citrus notes arise after the first few sips including orange, mango, guava, melon, and lemon. Earthy grassy and floral notes also become more pronounced along with a present dankness. Maybe a subtle amount of cracker and caramel malts present, but the malt character is underwhelming.

Feel: Medium carbonation with enhances the bitterness. Mouth feel is thick and usually I wouldn’t associate juiciness and bitterness, but this beer seems to have both. Definite alcohol warmness and a bit of a boozy aftertaste as the beer warms.

Overall: This beer is solid, very complex and a lot of good flavors, but the sweetness is a bit overwhelming and doesn’t allow for other complexities to show. Also pretty expensive at $14 for a 4-pack of tall boys. I don’t think I would buy it again, but if it was offered to me I wouldn't turn it down and I’m glad I tried it.",4.5

Everett,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one from his strike during NBS BIF #15. 16oz can (dated 5/18/21) Poured into 16oz tulip. Poured the expected dense, nearly solid, black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing.

The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops.

Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops.

The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered.

Drinkability was very good, a nice sipper, and an easy quaffer at the same time.

Overall, a very nicely done brew. A must-try if you get the chance.",4.0
Everett,"Canned on 10/12/21 (best before 1/12/22); consumed on 1/19/22

Pours a glossy jet-brown body with chocolate/chestnut hues and capped with two fingers of rich, light mocha foam; excellent head retention leaves a slim layer of frothy cap, a moderate, creamy collar, and a near-comprehensive coating of mounded, webby lacing caked across the walls of the glass.

Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close.

Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront, with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the mid-palate; malt roast grazes the back end, while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a medium-full carbonation, a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudo-creamy sensations throughout the mid-palate toward a firm, drying, and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish.

Lagery roast finds waves of smoke and silky chocolate undertones to fuse with an obsessive Hill Farmstead precision of texture, bringing the modesty of an American Porter to climax with detailed expression on an otherwise restrained medium.",4.5

Smell: lots of cocoa, coffee, toffee and brown sugar.
Taste: absolutely incredible! Perfectly balanced with a nutty malt backbone that stops just short of drifting into stout territory.
Feel: perfect body; thick but not chewy or overly sugary. Carbonation was on point and makes this eminently drinkable.
Overall: hands down one of the best--if not the best--porters I've had in a while. Would definitely seek this out as a winter-warmer, or after dinner drink. Best of all, the ABV is manageable and leaves room for another glass.",4.5

The taste is outstanding. Intense and complex. Dark chocolate, charred wood, malts, licorice, burnt toffee, dark roast coffee, and a bitter smoky flavor that becomes more intense on the aftertaste. Very smooth and well integrated. I really dig this one. Not surprised by the great ratings!

Creamy, almost like milk, chocolate. Not very sweet though. No coffee.

Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Lower carbonation. There's a bit more bitterness than the smell suggests but it seems to come from hops not black patent malt as there's no burnt elements of coffee flavors. Rich sweet to semisweet chocolate flavor before the bitterness comes from the swallow.",4.5
Everett,"Poured from a fresh can into a tulip glass:

Appearance: really dark brown, verging on black, with mahogany lights. Thick beige head. Plenty of retention and lacing, with fairly persistent head.

Very roasty, warm and inviting with multiple layers of aroma: light milk chocolate underlain by mellow coffee.

Taste follows the nose: deep base of roasted malt, with some bitter chocolate. Coffee notes are very mellow with a hint of vanilla and hazlenut.

Medium-bodied with light carbonation and really nice mouthfeel. Quite a clean finish for a porter.with a relatively crisp finish for a porter.

Overall: Wow! A benchmark porter. The depth of flavour is incredible for a beer with no adjuncts at this ABV. Combined with lovely mouthfeel and a fantastic finish this is truly a world class porter.",5.0

Hill Farmstead Brewery
Date: 18 May 2021
I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer. Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.

Oh wow, the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic. I smell dark roasted malts, chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a hint of floral, leather, intense earthiness, and subtle char note.

Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot. Dark roasty malts, toast bread, a touch of floral, a dab of Maillard, a tinge of char, tobacco, leather, earthiness, and a slight herbal note is what I taste next. The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate.

The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter, with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness.

The body is medium, medium carbonation, and has a long and delightful finish.

One of the best porter I have ever consumed. It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style. I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness.",4.75

Flavor – 4.25 – Begins slightly sweet with roasted malt and cocoa and a hint of coffee, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Slight gastric warming does occur. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends slightly bitter.
Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel. The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness. Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue. In total, particularly good porter.",4.25
Everett,"I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking.",4.5

550ml bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to leave nothing behind

S- aroma is rich with chocolate, cinnamon and chili pepper up front, followed by undertones of creamy lactose, vanilla, toffee and brown sugar. The tequila barrel comes across as a mezcal-like aroma, with some oaky bourbon juice in the background

T- rich malty chocolate up front quickly gives way to cinnamon and pepper skin. Mid-palate brings out the barrel notes; tequila takes center stage, with some oaky bourbon complimenting. The finish gives more cinnamon and chocolate, with a linger of pepper and creamy lactose

M- medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel turns slightly creamy into the finish. Some pepper heat pokes through after the finish

O- the barrel combo works well with this one, well done",4.5
Leche Borracho,"Brew: Bottle Logic Brewing – Leche Borracho

Intro: 500 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.

Appearance: Dark black color. Minimal head but some. Same with the lacing as we drank

Smell: Cinnamon up front followed closely with chili pepper, Bourbon brings up the back end.

Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Chili pepper is strong for my tastes.

Mouthfeel: Creamy but the chili holds that in check. Medium mouthfeel

Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. I’ve had better and I’ve had much worse. It’s not my favorite selection from Bottle Logic

Conclusion: I’ve had several other Bottle Logic brews and this would not be in my top 4 or 5. It is mostly because of the chili pepper but that is personal taste. I am a big fan of the brewery, just not this particular beer. It’s still finely crafted and is deserving of the score given",4.5
Leche Borracho,"Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer.",4.75

Nose is earthy sugarcane, burnt brown sugar, molasses, toffee, some cinnamon, and vanilla

Taste follows suit with the addition of barrel notes, however subtle. This doesn’t drink like 15%. Very easy drinking, oily, smooth, and full. Excellent example of the style and an over expression of what can be done with it. Glad to have finally tried it. Cheers.",4.25

2019 vintage from pint growler filled at B&V. Poured into tulip glass.

Same as prior but this time appearance was much better. Huge tan head, tons of thick lacing. Same great smell, taste and feel. About as close to perfect as I can imagine.

Feb 2020 Review
2017 vintage from pint growler bottles at Barrels & Vines 18 months or so ago. Poured into a pint tulip glass.

Basically the same review as in the past. This is an incredibly delicious candy bar masquerading as a beer. Appearance is probably the only weak point. Huge coconut, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate, bourbon nose and taste. ABV is well hidden; this one can get you into trouble. Super creamy moist. Still pretty much my favorite beer ever except for the high ABV and, now, taproom only distribution.

June 2018 Update
Had a 2017 vintage from a 16oz growler poured recently at Barrels & Vines.

Very much the same as original review with cinnamon a bit more pronounced, slightly less alcohol but every bit as good as I remember. Maybe even creamier than I recal. A great beer. Have a few more 2017 in the cellar. Can’t wait!
Didn’t get any 2018 as it was taproom only release which wasn’t practical for a SE MI beer lover.

2017 vintage (orange ball).
Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation.

Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless.

Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, other spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms.

Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right. Like the taste, it gets better as it warms.

Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone. The sugar and bourbon alcohol mix perfectly with chocolate, spice, vanilla and cinnamon.

Can't wait to age a bottle and drink another!",4.75
No Rules,"2016 vintage with the Purple Bowling Ball on the label, it pours pitch black color with a small tan/mocha colored head that faded faster then normal and left minimal traces of lacing. Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale.

Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone. A definite dessert beer to share with a few other beer lovers.",4.25

Space Trace,"2018 bottle, drank March 2021 out of an oversized tulip.

Look - poured with little head, quite dark and sludgy.

Smell - faint, maybe a little roasty.

Taste - a bit of coffee and dark chocolate but no coconut, the surprise was a chunk of something, must have been solidified coconut, that got trapped in my mouth and quickly dissolved. Nice taste, like it says on the bottle, like a chocolate cake, but I typically don’t like chocolate cake unless it’s tarted up with other stuff, and this was a straight chocolate cake taste. No alcohol or barrel to be found anywhere.

Feel - moderately thick.

Overall - a big let down for such an acclaimed beer. Firstly - I was most looking forward to that Bottle Logic Barrel and got none. Secondly, the chunk. Thirdly, the taste and smell didn’t jump out at me in any way. I mean, I didn’t NOT enjoy it, and it was cellared properly, but I’m just not feeling this one like other BLs.",4.0

Peche Du Fermier,"Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.

Peche Du Fermier,"Blend 3, from bottle.

Deep yellow-orange (like a peach) color appearance with foam which quickly dissipates. This smells like peach already, but a lot of barnyard funk too in the aroma. Flavor is plenty fruity, with overripe peaches throughout. Tart and acidic (not as acidic as some of the other Side Project beers but more than most would expect). Tart and dry finish.",4.25
Peche Du Fermier,"Foggy dull burnt orange with a short but persistent white blanket leaving some solid sheeting with a tilt.

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day, this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour. The frothy medium body is so much more balanced, with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk.

This is actually delicate by comparison to FdF, and as such, so much more enjoyable. However, we also had a few de Garde brews before this, and the comparison to the kings of stone fruit out in the Pacific Northwest is a stark one, no matter how formidable the challenger.",4.5
Peche Du Fermier,Blend #2,4.5
Peche Du Fermier,"Pours a clouded orange color with a medium, froth head.

Smells of riper peaches, old wood and bread dough among a lighter, stony pith quality. Got a lighter glue and blue cheese funkiness underneath, giving the fruit in this a nice little twist.

Drinks light, with an omnipresent acidity, balanced by a higher, refreshing carbonation.

Tastes of sun ripened peaches, not yet to the point of getting jammy though, due to a present acidic sourness, hitting the palate uncompromising. Turns a tad effervescent then, with a noteable mineralic note, wrapped up by older, oaken wood, adding a pleasant, funk accompanied complexity to the flavors. Finishes calmer, with maintaining sweet peaches, building a well working counterpart to the teeth numbing sourness in this, which the peaches manage to overcome during the aftertaste.

Very well rounded, fruited sour with a great balance to it, pushing successfully further than most other AWAs.",4.0

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Bottled on 1/10/2020; consumed on 1/29/2022

Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.

Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.

An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.",4.5

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"500ml black waxed bottle poured into HF white etched logo Charente glass (aka wine stem ""bulb"" glass).

75th unique beer from Hill Farmstead.

bottled on date is Jan 10, 2020.

Appearance: black bodied stout. 1-2 fingers tall; medium brown head. Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring. Booze legs with each sip. spotty lacing on the side of the glass.

Smell: While taking the wax off the bottle, I could immediately smell bourbon! Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass. Chocolate and smoke.

Taste: Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, & moderately roasty malt profile. Tobacco and leather. Smoke, peat moss, and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip; deep earthy and woody character as well. Umami richness in the middle of the stout. Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce; it's very faint and does not distract from anything here. Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip. Unique flavors here that I don't taste very often in barrel aged stouts; it's rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet. Complex. Interesting. Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied stout. Low and adequate carbonation levels. Creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich texture. It's not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is... in regards to this stout's texture. Damon is not at all boozy, but it does have a noticeable warming presence. This stout actually drinks heftier than the 10.5% abv & I do not mean this in a bad way at all. It's a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all. The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature. I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours, it retained smooth sipping status the entire time.

Overall: Well, this beer has eluded me for a really long time. Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what it's all about. I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel. Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd. It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture.",4.5

Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,"Pours pitch black, thin tan ring present on the outside of glass. Nose is rig milk chocolate and huge pB. Getting a little bit of woody oak and bourbon coming through. Taste follows the nose, get milk chocolate up front and then big pB. Roasty vanilla notes. A little burn from the barrel, but not a huge barrel presence. Creamy luxurious mouthfeel. Overall delicious. Don’t suspect these are aged long however as the barrel doesn’t play big here. Still a great offering from AC.",4.5
Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into an AC pint glass.

Pours a thick oily black body with a dark brown head that sticks around for a while and leaves spotty lacing.

Holy crap this smells unreal. Straight peanut butter chocolate fudge cookies straight out of the oven with extra vanilla extract in them and a touch of coffee. Marshmallow s’mores ice cream galore. Bourbon booziness in the background. Pastry city.

Taste is liquid Reese’s cups with dark chocolate fudge drizzled over them. Vanilla bourbon on the follow through, roasty coffee char on the finish. Thick rich body.

I am a sucker for a good pastry stout, and peanut butter cups. And this is the epitome of both.",4.75
Aurelian Lure,"Hazed golden straw with a finger-and-a-half of near-white foam head with tightly knit bubbles. Some modest, sloppy lacing clings to the sides of the glass before sliding back down into the crown and wisp.

Refined barnyard aroma with hints of hay, lemon and apricot fruit roll-ups.

Delightful taste of super-juicy dried apricot layered over a slightly sour, slightly funky barnyard-and-lemon base. There’s maybe a little white wine. Maybe a little oak. The tartness and acidity comes in on the backend, and is somewhat lighter than I expected. Really superb.

Soft, mildly creamy mouthfeel with tight carbonation.

One of the juiciest, softest-feeling sours I’ve had the pleasure of drinking. The acidity really isn’t over the top at all. I love this.",4.5

Bad Boy,"Nearly clear bright yellow brew with a thin cap of foam. Robust mouthfeel with super-sized malt. Aroma is mango. Flavors of dark orange, even some grapes. Rich and powerful with hot citrus.

Hold On To Sunshine,"6 months old. Can to tumbler.

Look: Pours pitch black with a full but patchy dark brown head that dissipates quickly. A lot of very fine floaters visible.

Smell: Peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints. Almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms.

Taste: Peanuts, chocolate and coffee. Slightly sweet, somehow roasty and minimally bitter.

Feel: Creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation. Quite smooth.

Overall: No barrel-aging, no double digit ABV, but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination. All flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability. There are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one I‘ve had so far.",4.5
Hold On To Sunshine,"Viscous and oily looking with light brown foam that settles into a thick ring with a few patches of lacing. Chocolate malts, lactose, Cocoa, and a bit of dry roasted peanuts. I’m not a huge fan of lactose in general, but here it does ok. Well carbonated and creamy. Overall really tasty, but not mind blowing in any way. I would definitely buy it regularly if it was available in my area.",4.25
Hold On To Sunshine,"16 oz can poured into a tulip pint glass. Pours pitch black with a surprisingly large mocha head. Good retention. Aroma and flavor feature dark chocolate, creamy peanut butter, dark roasted malts, bitter coffee, vanilla, and some earthy hop presence. This has to be the perfect peanut butter cup beer: not too sweet, real peanut butter flavor, not too strong abv-wise. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and not boozy. Overall it's a shockingly good beer and a real treat to drink.",4.75
Hold On To Sunshine,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Indicates YEAR THREE on the can with a date of 1/7/22, so this is being consumed at just after 3 months.

Look: Pours out very dark brown almost black with a deep brown colored, frothy head. The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin layer behind. Looks stunning.

Smell: The aroma is wonderful. This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also. There's even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish, which is very interesting for a milk stout.

Taste: Interesting. It is much sweeter than I was expecting. And that's appropriate, because this is a milk stout. I think it's just that from the nose, I expected it to be not as sweet as it is. The mouth mirrors the nose, but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma. Also, a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me. The finish is long and has a nice roasty, charcoally chocolate/coffee flavor.

Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively thick. This is smooth and chewy. Carbonation is spot on. Really nice.

Overall: This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed: Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing. One of the differences is that Gunner's Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV. Overall, this is a really great coffee milk stout. It was hard to choose between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall; in the end, I gave it a 4.25 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me.",4.25
Hold On To Sunshine,"16 ounce can in a tulip stout glass. Exactly 30 days since canned.

Opaque black crude oil color with a near 3f dark tan cap. A ring remains and leaves splashes of lacing. A beauty.

Smoky roasted malt aroma with peanut butter, chocolate, and fresh roasted coffee.

It tastes like a peanut butter, chocolate, and roasted coffee mix over a campfire. Nice.

Palate friendly full body and flavors. No sign of its 7.6% abv. Very rich and roasted.

Before opening, I let this sit for an hour after removing from the fridge. The temperature enhanced its aroma and feel. Rich and creamy peanuts and chocolate. Not built for every day drinking but so good.",4.5

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:

Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention.

Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well.

Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual ""wild"" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.

Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.

Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale's flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with.",4.5

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"No bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later, released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21

Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.

Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.

Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.

A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.",4.25
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Appearance - The beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent.

Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish.

Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.",4.5
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"A 750ml bottle, with no bottled on or best before date (although I’m pretty sure it’s either B1 or B2). Poured into a Tilquin stemmed glass.

Aroma: Funky, barnyard, minerals, light tartness, tropical stone fruit, apricot, unripe berries, green apple, citrus, grapefruit, lemon peel, oak, a touch of grains, with slight pepper notes.

Taste: Tart, tropical and citrus fruity, grapefruit, apricot, green apple, light funk, oak, vinous, with a lightly spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to try it fresh, but this bottle having aged 6 / 7 years, has aged gracefully with wonderful complex yet balanced aroma and flavours.",4.5
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"A bit of a gusher. Pours clear, dark gold with strong effervescence and three fingers of rocky, meringue-like, yellowed head. Decent retention gives way to thick, webbed lacing.

A little lemon and mixed fruit, clear wood, a hint of must and some pepper in the very enticing aroma.

Sour lemon again up front in the taste. Certainly tart, but without being an enamel stripper. Balanced somewhat by the strong wood, a little funk and again just a hint of mixed fruit sweetness. Maybe a little mineral water or clay in the finish.

Very soft feel. A touch more heft than expected. Soft, tickley carbonation.

A beautifully crafted beer from start to finish. A little more robust than some super refined beers, while still managing to expertly balance the sourness, tartness, funk and wood. A real treat.",4.25

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Bottle from The Beermongers. Thanks, Sam!

A clear golden yellow with a dense white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty excellent, a soft, bright tartness,with notes of key lime, lemon, a light, lightly toasted French oak note, mildly vinous and fruity. There's a little grape, and a real nice Brett expression, lightly spicy with a little clove and pepper and a touch of pineapple juice to go with a mild floral honey note. Really nice depth and structure.

The palate opens tart with a nice blend of lactic and lemon acidity along with a really nice Brett funk. The lactic acidity is sharp but fleeting, priming the palate for the fruit that follows. Delicate pineapple, grape, peach and honey are present. Minimal straw notes. The Brett expression is restrained but thoughtfully executed, pairing nicely with the oak notes, tannins, light vanillin and almost vinous notes. Drying, mildly tannic and earthy on the finish, long lasting with firm acidity. Light in body, crisply carbonated, nicely structured. Impressive.",4.5

PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,"Appearance: Arrives fudge colored with a beige head that settles in as a film but leaves plenty of lacing

Smell: The Tequila barrel aromatics dominate but there are lots of complementary aromatics of chocolate, spice cake, Bourbon and Brandy

Taste: Dark chocolate foward with hints of spice cake, brown sugar and vanilla; through the middle, the barrel tones emerge, with Tequila leading but the Bourbon and Brandy also in the mix; the finish brings all the flavors together with a slightly boozy edge

The taste is liquid gold. Lots of black licorice right away. Some charred wood on the back end. Some nice dark chocolate in the middle. Dark fruit coming through as well. Cherries and blackberries. Brown sugar and vanilla starts to come out as well. Some dark German bread. Really nice flavor.

Appearance: Black (only appears very dark brown at the edges if held up to a light) with a medium sized dark beige head which stuck around for a while.

Smell: Moderate Bourbon, brown sugar, mild vanilla and perhaps the faintest hint of tequila. A nice smelling IS.

Taste: Fairly prominent Bourbon, mild tequila notes, brown sugar, chocolate, and roast malt notes. The beer is mildly sweet, but the tequila notes and tannic oak notes help the beer finish fairly dry with just a hint of sweetness. Subdued alcohol presence for the ABV.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.

Overall: A good bal-aged beer from Firestone Walker. The tequila and bourbon bal-aging work well together in the flavor profile. This one is a keeper for sure.",4.5
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,"There's been a weird undercurrent the last few years that 'there aren't good tequila aged beers'. This, central waters and fiftyfifty often come to mind when I hear that aforementioned incorrect opinion. Had this at the very first Firestone Walker Invitational. Quite the nice find. Did they also bring it to the Bistro's barrel aged festival a few years ago? I dunno, you always remember the first and then after that its like ""meh"".

Anyways, pours black, had a very thin head on tap. Aroma gave off a nice mild tequila and wood presence, I thought it was cool. The taste took on a smooth, sweet tequila and low roast low bitterness kind of stout beers. A mix of different mild sweeteners, brown sugar, agave, vanilla = smoov just doin' his thang. Its a rather creamy beer that doesn't get bogged down in being oversweetened, fully hits the sweet spot but doesn't go beyond.

Its pretty good stuff and I could easily see dropping a nice penny to have this again. Its unique and very good.",4.0
Darkness,Truly a tremendous stout. I’m enjoying the 2020 vintage. I won’t repeat the reviews that have already been posted here. They ring true.,5.0
Darkness,"Darkness (2020) from Surly Brewing, Gorgon label with black wax. Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 09/07/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”. Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 65.6 degrees.
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy.
Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap. As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain.
Lacing – Good. As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites. See also above.
Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes. Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee. No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste. Good gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market. Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops. The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent!",4.25

It's a great looking pour. On the nose there is rich chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel/toffee, roasted nuts, leather, tobacco smoke, and char. The taste opens with lots of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and black cherry, along with strong coffee, dark chocolate, and dry barley. The fruit influence is stronger than I anticipated but welcome. It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific. Its mouth feel is creamy but not as thick and chewy as other big Russian Imperial Stouts. The carbonation is appropriate and the 12% ABV is warming.

Opaque in the glass, nice 2 fingers of head.

Aroma of dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, sambuca, molasses, sweet dark fruits.

Velvety smooth in the mouth, has a good amount of weight to it as well.

Tastes just as it smells, this is Russian Imperial Stout decadence here. Dark chocolate present throughout the palate, the molasses and sambuca are more mid palate, and the sweet finish of dark cherries and currants are a lingering treat in the finish along with that dark roasted malt.

Aging for over 5 years likely softened any alcohol heat and made for a delicious and decadent stout that does not disappoint, even with sky high expectations going in. I also have a 2020 bottle I will be comparing it to soon.",5.0
Darkness,"2021 Vintage

APPEARANCE
Pitch black body and a hefty three fingers of fluffy, tan-colored head

AROMA
An onslaught of leather, coffee, black licorice, tobacco, char, cherries. I mean, it goes down the list of everything you want in a superior RIS.

TASTE
Dark chocolate bomb with all of the aforementioned RIS accoutrement (fancy word) from the aroma. Most prominent is the black coffee and cherries. A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.

MOUTHFEEL
Smooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.

OVERALL
World Class RIS. I am no stranger to Surly Darkness and will never pass up a chance to have this.",4.5
Darkness,"2021 edition. In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.

The smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.

The taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.

The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.

Overall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find.",4.5

Taste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!

Mouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.

Overall, there's a reason why this is so highly rated. It's a winner through and through, even after sitting for 5 years waiting. Strong RIS, not to be taken lightly.",4.25
Darkness,"Really quite incredible head production, retention, and lacing given the ABV. Head is dark beige, not quite dark brown; body is an ebon hue befitting the name.

Impressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.

Thick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.

It's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.

This is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating.",4.5
Darkness,"#100, yummy!",5.0
Darkness,"Pours darkness of course, dark tan head good lacing.

Aroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.

Taste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.

Mouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.

Overall amazing what can be done with just roasted malts none of the additives used in all the big dessert stouts now a days. One fabulous brew. Bought another bottle to bring home to share it was so good.",4.75

I was tryin to sleep but took a 3 hour nap earlier and felt the Darkness calling me.

Poured out dark brown and settles like a dark night. A 1 and half inch head forms and settles into 1/4 inch light brown that does not go away.

Smell is a barrage of dark malt , dark chocolate, dark fruits and coffee. Exactly what is expected.

Taste is whats expected. Follows the nose like Tucan. Perfect blend of chocolate,coffee, caramel , fudge...pure glory in this one.

The mouthfeel is excellent. On the thick side and coats everything leaving flavor to resonate on the palate.",4.75

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Pours like syrup--smooth and sweet. Very dark brown with a mocha head. It is rich with strong milk chocolate flavor, and subtle coffee flavor underneath.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"16oz can poured into a snifter.

A: Black on the pour with two fingers of brown head. Retention is good, lacing manifests in broken rings.

S: Nose is heavy on the chocolate. Brownie batter and a generous helping of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Fatty nibs. Bit of woody roast and earthy hop. Berry-like fruity note. Nutty coffee.

T: Follows the nose. Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish.

M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little.

O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now.",3.0

Sosus,"Review 1491

I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers, I have yet to try their darker beers. The best by date is in a week, I need to get this one gone. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a bright white foamy and airy two-fingered head. The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale straw, with golden hues. The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within. The appearance of the beer is elegant.

The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles, grapefruit rind, floral esters, and herbal. Nosing further in the glass, I detect toasted bread crust, lightly toasted malts, oranges, lemons, papaya, and a touch of solvent.

The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, oranges, melons, lemons, guava, pineapple, herbal, floral esters, bready, lightly toasted malts, pine needles, phenols, wet grass, and peaches.

The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and crisp.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonations, and a fuller finish.

The one thing that is off-putting in this beer is the carbonation, it is strong, bubbly. The flavors of the hops are wonderful but bitter with a steady malt backbone. A pleasant DIPA, not sure it is worth the high score that it has. I have better DIPAs with the harmony finessed.",4.25
Sosus,Nice dark yellow color. Strong citrus notes and very hoppy. A lot of sediment at the bottom. Definitely a bit weird to have that much but overall a very tasty Double IPA.,4.5

Sosus,"L: A pale murky yellow, with a slight greenish and warm orange tints. Two fingers of stark white sticky foam with great retention and some splotches and wide bands of lace on the glass. The lacing is really beautiful.

S: Earthy papaya, and greener aromas such as green papaya and underripe pineapple. Both piney and peppery.

T: Still insanely bitter on the palate, but the other flavors are quite soft in contrast. And wow that bitter dryness goes on and on. I do like it though. Most would not pound this back - it's a sipper.

F: Smooth and mostly dry. Medium weight and decent carbonation.

O: I rarely call anything too bitter. This one is pushing limits. Overall I don't think it's my favorite from TG, (that might be Scorpius Morchella) but it is a really nice drink, that I hope to repeat.",4.5

Tropical fruit, mango juice. Thyme, pine, poultry spices. Only the smallest hint of rawness from the hops deep in the nose. The taste is more subdued than the powerful nose; slight oily, spicy, resinous, and bitter notes throughout, even numbing like a sichuan peppercorn. Moderate juicy sweetness, but the hop spiciness is strong enough to prevent it from taking a leading role. Mouthfeel is typical - round and soft, light carbonation.

Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"22 oz bomber (2015)

A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout.

S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact.

T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal.

M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.

O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer.",4.5
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit.",4.75
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"Look - Very little head with almost zero retention, and no signs of much carbonation. Opaque black in color.
Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, with underlying notes of cinnamon and vanilla and subtle chiles.
Taste - An almost perfect blending of Mexican chocolate and bourbon. The chiles were quite noticeable, but did not overwhelm in terms of flavor or heat. The same can be said of the bourbon.
Feel - Mouthfeel was a touch thin on the palate but enjoyable.
Overall - The aroma and flavors were so big and well balanced that I found myself focusing almost purely on those aspects. I would have enjoyed a bit more body on the palate, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment. This is among the best beers I've had to employ chile peppers.",4.5
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"12oz can, dated 01.29.2020, 2019 vintage stamped on the side of the can, poured into a 14oz brandy snifter.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin half finger of khaki head that recedes quickly, yielding no film nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, tons of fudge and chocolate, light pepper heat, tons of cinnamon, modest barrel, a nice oakiness with a good char and a bit of vanilla. The flavors are good, tons of chocolate, brownie batter and fudge but also a nice bitterness, dry cinnamon, light pepper heat with a super smooth bourbon character, lightly charred oak, modest roast with nice hearty grains and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is good, thick and heavy, chewy but smooth and it coats very well with a warm but creamy finish.

Verdict: A very nice adjunct forward barrel aged stout from Spiteful. A great chocolate forward experience that is well balanced and accentuated by the cinnamon and pepper interplay while the vanilla tames the barrel, which isn't too hot and offers even more nuanced character.",4.25

Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"Black with a slow to build fizzy tan blanket that dies off quickly.

Smell is nutty roast and dry wafer with moderately spicy cinnamon and slightly astringent but fruity and popping chili pepper.

Taste has more depth yet is also refreshing, with just the right amount of warming pepper that is both mildly spicy and sweetly fruity. Cinnamon is lightly dusty and complements the roast of the moderately light-bodied stout. There's a touch of nutty cocoa but not a whole heckuva lot. The carbonation is crisp and lifting for a big stout, with tightly compacted bubbles finishing perfectly semi-dry.

This is like an older school, more drinkable stout with a lighter body and flavorings that don't overpower. Additionally--a shocking note for this day and age--it's not cloying. The only thing I'm not really experiencing here is any barrel. Not even a boozy heat.",4.0

T: Taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence. Hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows. On the swallow there's more brandy barrel, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
M: This beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky. Carbonation is quite low, but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the ABV

It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too.

I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved. Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love, but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance. First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to. There’s very little carbonation too, even for a stout. I wonder if the age has something to do with that. Some lacing does stay though after the pour. On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb. I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot. I think that’s usually what goes after aging. It’s sweet but not overly so. There’s barrel flavor too. Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent. The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh. I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer. The barrel is perfect though. Great beer and worth seeking out!",4.5
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. No date on the bottle, but I know it is at least a few years old at this point.

A: Black pour. A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails. Little to no lacing. Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength.

S: The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected, and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass. Heavy dose of roasty coffee next, followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell. Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake. Roasted malt. Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms.

T: In taste, it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first. Tons of hot fudge sauce, chocolate truffles, German chocolate cake, fatty nibs, etc. Lots of vanilla too, mingling for a malted milkshake impression. Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor. Lots of whole chile taste too. The heat is extremely mild, but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit. Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component, surprisingly, but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely. Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish.

M: Rich in body with a bit of heft. Chewy and mouth-coating. Velvety. Low and gentle carbonation.

O: A bombastic beer overall, and a bit of a roller coaster ride. Rather than melding into a cohesive whole, each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate. It’s big, sweet, and straightforward. Even a little busy, if I’m being honest. That’s not to say it isn’t good- on the contrary, I really did enjoy it. If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout,” you’ll likely love it. I think it’s a solid enough beer, but its brutish approach and bold, hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrel-aged stouts. Very good, but not great.",4.0
Starry Noche,"To be clear this is absolutely a desert beer. Recommended to be had in s 4-6oz glass. Extremely thick dark color resembling black syrup. No head or carbonation. There’s a large amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut aromas. Looks, smells and tastes of hazelnut syrup. A little bit goes a long way. Arguably limited to no bourbon taste all hazelnut and chocolate syrup. Very unique goes well at the end of a meal with desert.

This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

I really like big pastry stouts, but this one is just too much. I used to really like the Medianoche series, but they seem to just be dialing it up way too far lately.",4.5

This smells like incredibly sweet melted milkshakes – it smells good, but it’s just ridiculously over the top.

There’s an absurd amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut on the nose here – like a high quality hazelnut coffee thing. Like, it’s certainly tasty, objectively, but it’s just so over the top.

Starry Noche,"Headlessly viscous burnt black with brown edges, the ominous appearance can't even begin to hint at just how HOLY SHIT WEIRD this 2021 bottle truly is.

Hazelnut paste quickly morphs into cashew cheese and buttered popcorn pot de creme that even verges into popcorn Jelly Belly, as one friend put it. But then my old lady described its nose as dirty dish rag and now I can't smell anything but.

We all had different glasses from different houses and this was our first pour during this bottle share, yet we all had the same offensive experience.

The mouthfeel is otherwise that thick and luscious, almost carbless globularity often hyptastically sought after these days, but not typically my own cup of tea. It clung ever so desperately to the kitchen sink as we drained pour the remaining putrescence.

How b2 has an over 4.5 rating on UnTappd is beyond me. What a bunch of sick, palate-wrecked liars. Speaking of, Anchorage's Sent By Liars is a far superior pastry stout if you're looking for something slightly more accessible that features these adjuncts.",2.75
Starry Noche,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours THICK like motor oil. Wow. Black with almost black head. The nose is incredible. Mostly hazelnuts upfront. Liquid hazelnut cream. Nutella all the way. It's almost hard to pick up much else. Over some time just sitting with the nose, I start to get some dark toffee, coconut, and more milk chocolate. Not a lot of barrel there.

The taste is insane. More dimensions than the nose. Definitely still getting the hazelnut as the dominant flavor, but also picking up some bourbon, toffee, chocolate, molasses, sweet dark fruit. I might say it's a bit too sweet, which is where I dock it a few points. Otherwise, the taste is really nice.

The mouthfeel is ridiculous. So thick and creamy. I would say this is the thickest and creamiest stout I have ever tasted. Definitely a treat.",4.5

Hazelnut bomb, but in all the best ways. It’s a bit oily and finishes bitter, but when paired with the coconut and thick stout base, it all combines for an amazing experience. And for the price point? 100% worth it every time.",4.5
Starry Noche,"500 mL bottle. Inky black. Smells of coconut and hazelnut. A little bourbon behind. Tastes of bourbon, lots of hazelnut, coconut, sweet chocolate, roasted malt. Harsh oaky bitterness in the finish, but it balances the sugar. Absurd pastry deliciousness.",4.25
Starry Noche,"A shameless explosion of blended barrels and adjuncts that stole my heart, incredible. Black oil appearance with a short lived brown cap. Smell bursts forth with hazelnut, coconut, vanilla, dark chocolate, backed with complex barrel flavors. For the taste I must once again admit I am a hazelnut fan, so this was paradise for me, huge rich hazelnut and chocolate dance amongst the oak and bourbon soak coconut, vanilla, faint dark roast coffee, caramel, and nutella. Feel is thick, chewy, warm, has a hint of nuttiness but way more so rich, full and decadent with the weight. I loved starriest night so it makes sense why I adored this, beer of the year entry only 21 days in!",4.75

Insert Hip Hop Reference There,"L - murky pour with thick, impenetrable haze. Looks like mud. Dark orange mango juice. Menacing, almost. Big-bubbled head that dissipates a little less quickly than typical Trillium fare, but I can already tell it's not going to stick around long.

S - hits hard with lime and bread. Toasted orange peel and graham crackers. Pithy pineapple, vegetal qualities, and hop puree. Smells like choking down hops. That's a good thing. If hops were air, I could breathe this.

T - lively burst of grapefruit juice. Some serious depth of flavor, featuring papaya, guava, apricot, and bubblegum if ""hops"" were a flavor. Warming, doughy orange peel and loads of citrus pith. Oat bitterness. Full and suffocating in flav. Rindy OJ, complete with pulp. Pineapple freshness. Syrupy candy on the finish that quicky zips it up with some tingly bitterness and lingering dryness.

F - pillowy. Yes, generic description, but it's true. It's seriously full and satisfying. An elixir to behold.

O - just wow. Such flavor range. Like wringing out every last bitter drop of your favorite ball of citrus. If I lived in the middle ages, I might think this has healing properties. In fact, I think I might be coming down with something (bit of a sore throat), but this is curing me up nicely. Hearing reviews saying it's too green so I'm glad I sat on my can for a month.

Brilliant marigold haze on the pour, capped by a stunning billowy white head that sticks around longer than J Lo's a$$ when she's leaving the room.

There's a touch of heat on the back end, but it does not diminish or overwhelm the palate. Soft, chewy, and fully mouthcoating, this beer seduces you with each sip taken.

Unsure fresh, but this beer at 8 months is a monster across the board.
Gorgeous slightly orange hinted golden yellow; hazy with a creamy thick white head… which breaks down into layers of dense foam that cascade in multiple halos within glass.
Nose is citric orange; grass; melon, double bubble . Flavor mirrors with more noticeable apricot tartness and some banana like richness coming through as well.
Body is velvety smooth only lightly carbonated. Rich but not heavy or sluggish. Not for everyone but spot on in my wheel house. Seems almost hand pulled from cask. Absolutely no double digit ABV noticeable at all. Mastercrafting here.

Triple Citra Daydream,"Poured a golden-orange body with two-finger head that slowly died and left a lace ring down the glass. Aroma struck me as a mix of mild grapefruit and citric hops along with smidge of tropical fruits and floral notes. Fuller-bodied, slightly sticky, a touch of booze and maltiness in the beer but mostly a tropical fruit sweetness that balances with a floral hoppiness and then a touch of citric zip on the finish. Great balance between different aspects and well-hidden booze make this an enjoyable beer.",4.25

Crazy, ridiculous long lasting head and thick lacing. Really something else for a beer of this ABV. Super green hops and sweaty gym clothes followed by bubble gum, berries, mango.....

Man, I can’t remember the last new Stout I had from Tree House. They tend to excel at these Milk Stouts, so I have high hopes for this one. Plus this is one of the last few TH beers in the BA top 250 I’ve yet to rate, so I’m excited to finish up that list

Pours nearly pitch black with a finger of mocha head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is certainly sweet in aroma, but it’s not overbearing. I’m picking up on aromas of milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, chewy caramel, sweet vanilla, light cinnamon, and a touch of char

There’s actually a pretty good sense of balance here in taste, I wasn’t expecting a dry finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, chewy caramel, raisin, creamy coffee, brown sugar, light cherry, and cocoa powder. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, dark cherry, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light caramel, and roasted malt

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and creamy beer. Dries out over the duration of the swallow, leaving just the slightest stickiness

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer

Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple

It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest

A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness

It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine.

Silky black with a minimal bubbly head.

Aroma of huge spices and hot fudge, with emphasis on nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon, but with extended depth and oak sweetness. Slightly coffee, with coconut and more fudge.

The beer is like your childhood - but barrel aged. Huge fucking BARREL AGED nutmeg in your face. Cinnamon. It's so Christmas-y, and rich and full. Tons of fudge in the background with hot caramel sauce and peppermint coffee. Fading notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, fudge, and bourbon. This is magic.

Feel is a bit thin from the barrel but still within thick stout territory. Alcohol heat is evident and welcome, with a slightly slick feel and a hot finish. Good carbonation too.

Overall,. an absolutely phenomenal, incredible beer that I wish I could find here in Tulsa to take home via package liquor but unfortunately could not. Do not waste your time on mediocre beer. Life is too short. That is the greatest lesson I have learned in 3,000+ beers. If they suck, walk. Prairie does not. Worth the $17, even at the bar. Created a memory burned into my brain.

Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,"If the emperor gets to wear new clothes then this king of stouts dons its Christmas attire! This time enveloped in bourbon drenched Santa suit, the flavors of the Christmas Bomb! imperial stout are brought to the palate with generous additions of holiday spice and the warmth of the bourbon barrel.

Much like thatch, the Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb layers in the glass with a patient swirl of coffee-like creme. Ominously dark and carrying a mirror-like sheen, the deep and deviant perfume overcomes the nose with espresso, holiday spice, dark chocolate, grilled fruit, vanilla, whisky and cream. Its lavish taste slathers the early palate with toffee, vanilla, molasses and a general gingerbread flavor before the chocolate and char follows closely behind.

Develops a more earthy character through the middle palate, those fresh flavors are decadent with bittersweet chocolates and roasting walnut in its bitterness power. A syrupy chocolate taste and texture is matched with the spiciness of sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove and vanilla as the barrel's taste of oak, caramel, toasted cherry and grape give a soft vinous tone in the end.

Remaining rich, viscous and off-chewy, the beer's full and creamy body weighs on the tongue with the low-lying carbonation that ensures full saturation of the tastebuds. Trailing with a long, heated warmth of good 'ole Kentucky bourbon, its the chocolate and vanilla that provide balance with a simmering warmth of holiday spice in mulled ale form.",4.5

Juicy,"Bottled on February 14, 2020. Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat.

On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity.

Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine.",4.5
Juicy,New Zealand inspired beer - aged in wine barrels for 8 months and is fruity and a darker color. Tasted of wine and some sharpness as well in this beer.,4.5
Juicy,"Alan, thank you so much for this one.

2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles.

Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out...

Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling.

Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony.",4.5

Vineous and tart on the palate with undertones of Burgundy, citrus, and apples. Finishes fairly dry with some lingering tannins, red fruit, and grapeskins.

Pours a light color, slight head, not much lacing, lingered nicely in my mouth and I could smell it just when I opened it before I poured it. Wonderful beer.

Opaque, seal brown liquid with a low dun collar. Very fine lacing; fast running legs; poor retention.

Bourbon, molasses, winter spices, baker's chocolate, fresh dates, and roast malt in the nose.

Flavor follows the nose but with significantly more intensity and complexity. Rye and hops blend together with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Long, even, medium-dry finish with hints of loam and char. Faint tobacco, vanilla, and coconut emerge as the ale warms.

Medium bodied, faintly oily, with low but sufficient carbonation.

Roasty and toasty malts lay underneath, keeping the beer from listing into sugary, and doing their darndest at that. A touch of barrel char at the end insures balance.

Darkstar November,"2019 release. I received this from @2beerdogs. Poured into a snifter. It pours nearly black with a full finger of creamy, medium-mocha lacing with excellent retention considering the alcohol level. On the nose there is roasted malt, char, tobacco smoke, toffee, and a strong scent of bourbon. The taste is considerably sweeter than the smell would indicate. It opens with fudgy chocolate, vanilla, and molasses with hints of dark fruit in the background. The Buffalo Trace bourbon is strong and warming but the overall flavor has a soft quality. Its mouth feel is plush and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and I can really feel the 14.09% ABV. Overall, Darkstar November is a huge Russian Imperial Stout with loads of flavor. It's a great sipper and I'm grateful to have tried it.",4.5

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head that quickly recedes. Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and distinct chocolate and vanilla notes, as well as some cinnamon and hints of licorice and oak. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, caramel malt, strong milk chocolate and vanilla, lighter cinnamon and chili heat, as well as hints of dark fruit, with accents of raisin and fig, licorice, leather and bourbon-infused oak. Finishes with a light sweetness and some chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a pleasant chili heat lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.

It's been so long since I managed to get my hands on a decent mexican chocolate stout, so this BBA brew goes down a real treat. I've had regular Oro Negro before and really enjoyed it, while the BBA version feels a lot richer, with the bourbon character coming through marvellously here. While this also makes the beer a little bit more sweet and boozy, with that bourbon and additional vanilla notes really standing out, the spice and roasted notes balance this out very nicely, with the chili heat being just right for my personal taste. Overall, this makes for a very rich mexican chocolate stout with an excellent balance of sweet and spicy notes and a great bourbon character, as well as full body and mouthfeel.",4.5

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Modest head production and retention, but it's not completely still.

Wonderful aroma. Bourbon isn't as prominent as other Jackie O's BBA stouts. Smooth and semi-sweet, with vegetal pepper notes along chocolate and vanilla.

Really nice melange of flavors on the palate. Peppers are very restrained, noticeable for my palate only from very large sips - but I get very little pepper in chili beers normally unless it's strong and prominent. Chocolate is rich and smooth; the vanilla is complementary; I don't get any cinnamon; the bourbon, as with the nose, is restrained but wonderfully complementary. Overall flavor is a big, semi-sweet imperial stout, arguably more of a dessert stout than a chili stout - quite reminiscent of the last few years of Mexican Cake.

Mouthfeel is adequately full and lively; I would prefer both more thickness and more activity, but it's a very drinkable beer.",4.25
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours inky black with minimal head. Aroma of roasted almonds, chocolate syrup on the nose. Some vanilla and oak as well. Lots of chocolatey notes in this one. Some vanilla and oaky burn on the finish. It's not super sweet, but there's enough sweetness. It's lean and doesn't have the heft of the some of the thiccer bois you hear a lot about these days. The heat from the habañero burn is unignorable on this hot summer day and the idea that it's always stout season seems incomprehensible at the moment. This is a nice stout though and it's always cool to get a top 250 beer in distro.",4.25
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"12 oz bottle, poured into a goblet at 40 degrees F and allowed to warm during consumption.

L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly.

S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent.

T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste.

F: Full and thick, this brings to mind liquid bread blended to syrup.

O: This is a complex delight of a barrel-aged stout. But hey, it's Jackie O's. They're not exactly a slouch of a brewery.",4.75
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,Good stuff!,5.0
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,Chocolate spicy walnuts. Thick and lucious.,4.75
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"A- 375ml bottle pours into a tulip glass with a motor oil black body. The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness.

S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here.

T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes.

MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers.

Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest.",4.25

Arcane Rituals,"Pours a deep amber brown color with thin tan head. Smells of sweet dark fruit and caramel. The taste is of caramel brown sugar and toffee, bitter boozy finish. The feel is full bodied and smooth, subtle burn. Overall a fantastic barleywine.",4.25
Arcane Rituals,"Pours a very dark brown with no head formation after a modest pour straight into the glass. Some oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl. Aroma is dark fruits, fig, toffee, and brown sugar with a hearty throughout. Caramel, toasty, and light bready malts shape the rest of the beer aroma profile. Sweet cognac and light bourbon heat pair up with barrel character for a subtle twist of heat within an otherwise sugar nose. Flavor profile is cognac booze right up front, paired together with dark fruits and figs. After the opening act, bourbon, brown sugar, almond, and grassy, herbal hops take over, forming a slightly sticky, firmly sweet flavor profile. Barrel character is minor, instead allowing individual liquors to shine and simmer in the spotlight. Wonderful dynamics and shape from start to finish. Mouth feel is a boiled-over-medium texture with a near still effervescence that carries a consistent minor fluffiness throughout. Just a little bit plush, but mostly flat. Thickness is medium-thick. Overall, really incredible use of various liquor influences to enhance and build on a dark fruit, fig, and toffee forward ale. Despite only being 11.37% ABV for this batch's bottling, it's a powerhouse of flavor.

Just what I hoped it'd be. The barrels are prominent, I get some bourbon and plenty of brandy/cognac, can't quite tease these two apart but I taste plenty of boozy fruit. They also bring hints of vanilla and leather. An incredibly decadent base beer shines through as well. Quite sweet, with notes of toffee, brown sugar, cherry, figs, and so much more. I love the lingering boozy exhale. The body is full and sticky with light carbonation. Lives up to the hype.",4.75
Arcane Rituals,12/28/2021: Poured from a 500ml bottle into a stemless wine glass. Thanks to Josh for the share. I sampled this right after VSOJ so that is a tough follow but this beer is excellent in mouthfeel and flavor.,4.5
Arcane Rituals,"Pours a dark ruby tinged brown color. Opaque and shiny. Thin, velvety tan head forms on the beer before dissipating. The only residual head is a thin ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Aroma is incredibly rich and pungent for a barleywine. There are notes of rich bread, fruit cake, dark fruit and overly ripe cherries, toffee, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, along with strong barrel notes that carry notes of each - cognac, brandy, and bourbon.

Taste follows the nose with notes of boozy fruit cake, dark cherries, oak, light tannic notes, toffee, brown sugar, with light notes of vanilla and cocoa with a slight cherry tartness on the back end. Lots of barrel character comes through with clear notes of brandy, bourbon, and cognac showing up in the profile. Its sweet - not too sweet, but definitely on the sweeter side of barleywines. The profile overall is decadent, rich and flavorful. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and viscous. Carbonation is sprightly but nicely balanced. Trending dry on the finish.

Overall this is an amazing barleywine - I know I have used the word decadent multiple times in the review, but it really is the best way to describe this beer.",4.75

Arcane Rituals,"Appearance: Very dark brown color with a medium sized beige head that slowly faded but stuck around nicely. A good looking Barleywine.

Smell: Bourbon & fruity brandy aromas jump out the glass. I also pickup moderate brown sugar aromas. The nose is inviting.

Taste: Toffee/brown sugar, Bourbon notes, and Brandy notes all make their presence felt in the flavor profile. The beer starts off fairly sweet and though it dries up a bit in the finish, it still has a fair bit of sweetness. Maybe because I know what was used but I swear I can pick up peach notes from the Peach brandy barrels it was aged in. Mild alcohol presence for the listed 11.37% ABV.

Mouth-feel: on the full side of medium-bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Full mouthfeel for a BW.

""Brewed with blackstrap molasses and licorice, cherry bark, vanilla bean, 50% is aged in bourbon, wine, and oak"". Scored this bad-boy pre-aged from the best beer store in the state (shhhh... it was $6)

Pours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?",2.75
The Abyss,"Has anyone ever said, “I cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil?” Well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an IPA so that adjective (oily) never seemed correct. Dirty motor oil, I guess.
If my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking.
It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!
It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say.
The taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say.
You guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd! Add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it.

Looks decent enough in a large wine glass. Jet black body, small tan head doesn't last too long, hence not much lacing.

On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue. Some molasses, and even faint soy.

Abraxas,"Well i traveled north to a beer joint i'd never been to before but i knew they had good ratings and were a well liked store. Mack's Beverage in Parma, Ohio. Well yes, the place was very cool and had a lot to choose from. But i was really surprised to see multiple vintages of Abraxas on the shelf. The different years were different prices so i just bought the oldest and most expensive one which was a 2020. $25. Worth a try. Poured into a snifter and man that head just disappeared as soon as i poured it. Color was dark brown. The smell is sweet like cocoa and coffee, with a tinge of spiciness to it that tingles the nose a bit. Taste is rich and velvety, warm smooth melting chocolate and a slight bitterness of coffee. Yes the cinnamon is also there enriching the experience. I'm looking for more chili pepper in the beer. It's slight but not nearly strong enough to get my top marks. I like it when the beer bites back. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and full, bubbling only the slightest bit. Another reviewer compared this to Christmas Bomb and Xocoveza, and having had both those beers, I would say this rates pretty highly up there with both of those brews. Overall this is an awesome beer, and definitely one of the better stouts i've tried. There's nothing spectacularly unique about it, but as far as a stout goes, this sets the bar pretty high, manifesting what a stout can be if it's done well and done right. Cheers!",4.25

It smells of cinnamon, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds and roasted peppers up front, followed by cocoa powder, brown sugar, charred wood and cooking spices. The ABV was quite subdued in the nose.

Tastes of dark chocolate and smoked chili peppers up front, followed by cinnamon, milk chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, roasted grains, cocoa powder, brown sugar, molasses, red wine, charred wood and cooking spices. The flavor has a lot of smoky, charred aspects but still does down easy like a well aged bourbon.

Abraxas,"Crowler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, unknown vintage but presumably the latest release from 2021

Yet another legendary Stout acquired at Half Time yesterday! The difference in rankings between this and the barrel aged version of it is shocking to me, at #245 vs #3, respectively. Still, I’m expecting a quality beer with this one. Let’s get into it

Pours jet black with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The peppery spice in the nose is really nice, it combines well with everything. I’m picking up on aromas of chipotle pepper, earthy cinnamon, roasty coffee, milk chocolate, spicy whiskey, light raisin, and vanilla

The balance carries over into taste, with the pepper adding a nice but firm spice. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, chili pepper, dates, and vanilla. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, vanilla, spicy whiskey, roasty coffee, and toasted oak

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice sweetness

Abraxas,great mixture of flavors - can't taste the chill peppers mostly cocoa flavor comes thru,4.0
Abraxas,"If you're a fan of Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, then congrats - you're already a fan of Abraxas.

A pretty leisurely pour into an imperial pint glass produced a thick, beautiful 4 inch tan head. The head itself appeared slowly and almost dramatically, and only after I'd stopped pouring. It breaks down slowly, forming a 1/2"" cap with fantastic lacing.

Smelled of molasses, cinnamon, cacao, and chilies. This is a beautiful aroma, very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb, but smoother and more refined.

Taste followed the nose, but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together. Too often, winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey. Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect, creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao. To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action.

The mouthfeel of this beer is complex. Drink it before the head dissipates, and you have a milkshake. Drink it after the head reduces down to a 1/2"" cap, and you have a thick, viscous, smooth delight. Very light carbonation.

I paid around $25 for a 750ml bottle, and it was worth every penny. This is perfect for a Christmas get together, or just a cold winter night. Most definitely in the same class as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, but Abraxas is the elder statesman of the group. Buy it, and be prepared to be amazed.",4.75

I like the aroma, the brew smells like Ancho chilies, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malt, cacao nibs and some earthiness. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some dark bread, coffee and burnt/charred malt flavors. I think all the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and coating with a low/moderate amount of carbonation.

Abraxas,"The first time I've tried this was on Valentines day at a dinner at one of my favorite restaurants w/ beer pairings with Perennial beer. It was one that really stood out and I enjoyed them all.

It was just as good as the first time. The only beer I've had that's similar in taste to this is Firestone-Walker's Mole Merkin. There's a ton of flavor in this beer but they all mix together quite wonderfully. This is one of my favorite beers, I'm big on stouts and this one is up there with the best of em . Update for 2021-2022 version, it was as good as the first time I've tried it. One of my all time favorite beers, I can't recommended it enough!

Abraxas,"Had from a 64kz growler. Pours a thick motor oil black with a tan head that springs up once you stop pouring. The brew has a beautiful tan colored coating around the glass when swirled. It smells like molasses, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and hints of toffee. The taste is truly incredible. At lower temperatures the chocolate and alcoholic sweetness take the center stage with vanilla extract like aftertaste. The flavor gets better as it warms and almost taste likes a dark chocolate cinnamon roll. It's very very thick and completely coats the mouth, but it's slightly carbonated and much more refreshing than anyone could ever expect. It goes down illegally smoothly for a 12% beer. Overall very very good, don't pass this up if you have a chance to grab it on tap.",4.75
Stickee Monkee,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.

The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.",4.25

Consumed 5/23/21

Stickee has always been a favorite for me. I love a great quad and Firestone does an amazing job adding a barrel aged component. The nose is wonderful. The barrel is prominent and it’s perfectly sweet. I don’t know what the aging has done to this bottle. It’s super smooth but was it harsh before? I doubt it. I’d probably drink this fresh in the future. A world class beer and perhaps the best quad you can find? One day I’ll find a Westy 12 to test that theory.",4.5
Stickee Monkee,"2014 Vintage
A: Poured into a snifter to a deep brown beer which is topped by a finger of dense and slightly rocky light tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass
S: Smells of tons of dark fruits, caramel and toffee along with a nice touch of oak
T: Taste is caramel and toffee up front before some dark fruits come in. Nice bready malt with a huge amount of sugary sweetness along with some hints of oak and vanilla. On the swallow there's more brown sugar sweetness, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, oak, and vanilla.
M: This beer is on the heavier side of things with a silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is soft but adequate for the style while the ABV ensures that this beer has a dying finish.
O: Overall this beer rocks the house. A huge amount of complexity makes this a beer that demands to be sipped and savored. Alcohol is hidden very well. It's also held up very well to the test of time and shows no signs of off flavors.",4.75
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this.",4.5
Samuel Adams Utopias,"This is my review of the 2021 edition of Utopias. I regret missing missing the previous editions, this is my first. With much anticipation I waited for my local Total Wine to show it in stock & rushed over to hesitantly with $240. I’m more than a bit thrifty but I wanted to try this legendary brew. I ordered proper glassware to serve this ‘“beer”. Poured into a Glencairn whiskey glass, the headless, reddish liquid was a perfect match of the mahogany trim on my Stressless recliner. Aroma, I can’t imagine anything prettier, it would make a great perfume: bourbon, sherry, wine, caramel, maple & an abundance of barrel aromas. Flavor: far more complex flavors than my meeker palate can discern but here are few I can pick out, bourbon, wine, caramel, ripe fruit, vanilla with maple & tart cherries at the finish. There is no carbonation but plenty of alcohol, this definitely a sipper. It is delicious & it’s aroma is heavenly. Is it worth the high price? Probably not. Will I try another in future? Probably, at least one more. Besides, it matches my furniture.",4.75
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Is this a beer? Convince me! I bit the bullet when my local brew shop procured a trio of these for customers with more cash than sense. I've still got the bottle here on my desk, and it's a good way to start conversations with fellow hop heads.

Zero head, zero carbonation. A dark amber color that smells like a strong port. It tastes kind of like a port that was made from raisins and maple syrup instead of grapes. The mouthfeel is weirdly oily, probably due to the use of maple syrup in the brewing process. Best enjoyed in moderation, because it's gone before you know it.

I'm glad I had the experience, but I can't see myself getting it again. It's just way too expensive for what you get. The oily character was a little off-putting to me, and while I liked the strong raisin flavor, I wasn't as fond of the maple. And in no way is it experienced like something you'd call ""beer."" You take careful shots, there's no carbonation, and it's stronger than many cocktails.

It's probably not fair for me to call it ""overrated,"" and given the expense of brewing it, I can't quite say it's overpriced. But the experience was more costly than it was worth for me.",4.5

The strong booze coats the tongue first, followed by mounds of sweet maple and molasses, becomes quite reminiscent of whiskey, some notes of vanilla and a light cinnamon, don't get a tone of the cherry but a very slight note of them.

Samuel Adams Utopias,"2019 vintage

Here we are BA, my personal whale. Sam Adams Utopias. Me and my buddy Pru managed to find a bottle about 2 hours from home because we just couldn’t wait for this year’s release. This is also beer #800 for me! I’m very excited to break into this, so I’m gonna stop wasting time and open it up

Obviously this is not a beautiful pour for beer, but the presentation of the bottle alone is worth a 5. Pours clear dark amber with no head but nice legs

It’s very evident that this was brewed with maple syrup, as the nose is a mapley booze bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, sticky maple, cinnamon, sweet vanilla, rum raisin, smooth oak, dark cherry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and a touch of honey

This is super sweet in taste, somewhere in between a barleywine and a bourbon or cognac. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting strong maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, dried plum, and burnt sugar. The swallow has a pretty decent burn and brings notes of sweet maple syrup, black cherry, spicy bourbon, buttery oak, brown sugar, creamy vanilla, dried plum, sherry, fig, and a touch of cocoa

A medium full body with almost no carbonation, just an alcoholic tingle resulting in a rich beer. Finishes somewhat dry but quite sweet

This is not necessarily an amazing beer, and not even necessarily a beer. However, it’s really a once in a lifetime experience, and I am thoroughly enjoying it. To good beer and better freiends!",4.25
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Excited to finally have a Utopias. Only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none. Sharing this bottle with my bud Rug. Based off looks, phenomenal. Never before had to unbox a beer. Smells strong, gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon. Slightly burns to smell but that’s to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage. Tastes strongly of maple syrup, and bourbon. Hints of cinnamon in the background. Medium feel, finishes sticky. Overall a phenomenal experience. Not anything phenomenal to the senses, but one any craft beer fan should have.",4.25
Samuel Adams Utopias,"2007 vintage - First opened July 4, 2021 - Review on July 6, 2021.

This beer looks thick as heck while pouring. It's a red/brown color coming from the bottle. There's no head at all, which doesn't surprise me one bit, based on the age and ABV.
The nose is out of this world. In a way, to me, it smells like a fine bourbon. Very boozy, first off. I get tons of caramel, toffee, chocolate, raisin, plum, and so much more that I can't fully describe. This is an outstanding aroma.
Taste - I know I won't do justice to this - Chocolate is up front, as is the raisin and plum. It then goes to the back to toffee and caramel. I'm also getting vanilla in the mix. This is really only a small portion of the flavors I'm getting overall, but I just can't put words to them.
Body - Up front there's a bit of a burn from the alcohol, but WAY less than the ABV would suggest. It then turns to a smooth, almost creamy feeling, that is so smooth and easy drinking.
This is worth the hype, and I'm so happy I got the chance to get a bottle. Being in the liquor business now, I'm going to try to get another the next time it comes out, just to see the difference between vintages.",5.0

DBR,"22oz bottle, taken from notes of Aug 2017

Pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge. Smells of oaky bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee and light coconut. Tastes of bold roasted notes up front give chocolate and char, followed by a compliment of barrel juice, oak, vanilla and caramel. The coconut develops near the finish, as well as more roast and barrel character. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a warming finish",4.5
DBR,"Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 22 oz bottle from the purchase at the brewery on 12/1/17 (Greatest Hits batch). Reviewed on 1/1/18. Poured into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Very dark brown to black, and opaque. A minimum of visible carbonation, and only a tan ring of foam. The foam stays around, but no real head formation.

S: Bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Waffle cones and tobacco. Dark roasted malts with a modest roasty bitterness. Mild oak tannins. Quite a nice aroma, especially for non-adjunct stout.

T: Bourbon and dark chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Sticky dark roasted malts, milder coffee, Oak, tannins, more vanilla. Some drying tobacco within the tannins as well. Then more sweet bourbon and chocolate in the hang.

M: A nice heavy, thick and sticky body. Carbonation is low but fine for style. The alcohol flavors are very, very well-hidden for the monster ABV listed. Good barrel balance as well – obvious bourbon flavors but still lets the other flavors come out.

O: So…this is an excellent beer. Big sweet dark malty beer with good barrel presence and thick mouthfeel. BUT…I just had the Calusa Barrel-Aged Sworn to the Dark – and I think I might prefer the Calusa. It’s not a huge gap, and it’s rather like picking between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, since I really liked both of them. Would drink this one again in a heartbeat.",4.25
DBR,"Great Hits DBR bottle. Strong, rich chocolate. As has been my experience with many Cycle beers, the barrel is very mild and subdued - there's a light woody presence to the beer, but the alcohol is very well blended.

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Pours a firm burgundy color with a little haze to the transparency. A little protein build up floats in the glass. The first 3/4 of the bottle was poured into the glass for this review, with more sediment in the final quarter. Head is three fingers of off-white foam, which retains well. Aroma is sticky caramel, toffee, raisins, and bread pudding. A little yeast spice counters the initial sugary notes, with bready, caramely, light earthy malts firming up the whole thing. Clove adds a bit of herbal bite to the mid-section. Flavor profile is raisins, toffee, molasses, cinnamon, and almonds. Spicy yeast esters work well with bready, caramely, earthy malts to balance out the initial sugary notes, without smothering them out. In total, it has a hearty bread pudding taste without being over zealous in sweetness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft, expansive effervescence that seems to feel bigger at the end than the start. This effect helps create a comforting, full feeling. Overall, some great malt and flavor undertones in both nose and taste. A comfortable blanket of a beer.

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"330mL bottle (best by 10/23/2019, so bottled 10/23/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.

Pours a slightly hazy deep mahogany with minimal head, lots of tiny floaties suspended throughout, steady carbonation rising to the surface.

Aroma is bready and sweet with notes of figs and dates, candi sugar, caramel. Delicate and nicely balanced.

Taste is likewise bready, balanced, and complex. One thing that stands out here, that I often don’t notice, is the quality of the water—clean and refreshing with a subtle mineral quality, like a cold spring. Caramel, dark stone fruits, Belgian yeast. Some vaguely wintery spice and subtle Old World hops.

Mouthfeel is balanced and medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Finishes clean and crisp, just right.

Overall, and not surprisingly, we have here a truly excellent, world-class dubbel. Maybe one of the best ones I’ve ever had.",4.5
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Pours a deep, dark brown coloration with a medium, fluffy, lasting head. Smells of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt and estery fruit and spice, with just a hint of dark fruit and chocolate also coming through. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt, chocolate and dark and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, fig, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of licorice and herbal, bitter hops. Finishes bittersweet, with notes of estery fruity and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

This actually feels very close to their Quadrupel for me, except maybe being not quite as rich, a little more carbonated and just a tad more roasted and bitter. For my personal taste, I probaly prefer it, to be honest. Still, without being quite worth its secondary price, this makes for a very impressive Dubbel that just stands slightly above offering such as Westmalle, St. Bernadus and Chimay due to its richness, balance and above all body and mouthfeel, with the estery character really standing out here.",4.5

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Even rested/chilled it forms head really fast, so pour super-slow. Pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a mid-tan 6Cm head. There's fast rising CO2 micro-bubbles up the side of the nucleated glass. ps. Holds well and forms major lacing on the way down.
S- Strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts; it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up Maltesers might smell.
T- Again very malty, deep roasty, a notably fat but classy ABV% note crosses my palate, off into hops, then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish. Solid yet refined. Blimey, if you think this beer's reputation is hype, wait until you try it!
F- Rich deep roasty, the ABV% is clear enough it's similar to some liquor barrel aged beers.
O- I picked this one for my 1950th review (the WestV12 will mark B2k). I was conscious of the brewery's repute and hype surrounding it, the difficulty getting their beer etc etc. Would I be underwhelmed, would I be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high. No way at all, this is a seriously luscious beer. Now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a 'mere' 8% beer lets you get an ABV% zing from it - some regard this as unclassy - but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me.
I'd happily drink this again, hell-ya, just maybe not at the cost it is imported into the UK!

The taste is a luscious malt forward sweetness with Belgian candied sugars and the slightest clove and coriander character. Just delightful.",4.75
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"A relatively gentle pour into a tulip still resulted in loads and loads of fizzy, beige colored head with some decent lacing. This is a very active beer in the glass. After 5 minutes, the head is still almost an inch thick and continues to be actively reinforced by the carbonation from below. Color is dark cola brown with a nice reddish tinge. Aroma is malty and sweet with a hint of alcohol.

Taste has a wonderful balance of sweet malts but with a nice dry finish. There's a complexity to this that I just can't place, but whatever those tastes are, they're working very well together. For me, the feel really shines. Medium+ bodied, plenty of carbonation but not overdone, and smooth in a way that really hides the alcohol. Very well done beer.",4.5

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Poured black and viscous - topped with an impressive (considering the ABV) brown head that reached a good 2 inches over the liquid. The lacing was just as impressive; it remained in the glass long after I finished.
The aroma, while mild to my chemically damaged nose (Invest in a decent respirator people!) still got through some dark fruits (plums, raisins) and bourbon. Hmm, smells pretty good.
Taste followed, along with some coffee; both in the warmth of the initial sip and the bitterness of an overly roasted bean. Interesting!
The feel was also very good; viscous enough for the ABV but not chewy- just nice, smooth sipping.
OA, this is a very good BA stout, and I'm a bit perplexed by it's sub top 100 in stouts ranking, but I suspect that means I just need to try more stouts.
Also, in my opinion alone, I believe the non BA version to taste a little better. I have to have them side by side to verify.",4.5
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pours out like used motor oil; pitch black, capped with a creamy light brown head. Great retention and lacing that belies its abv. Like chocolate syrup with a toasted marshmallow on top.

I'm not picking up much aroma this time. Maybe it's too cold? I get molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, and bourbon for sure, though.

The flavor is dominated by rich dark chocolate, baking cocoa powder, espresso, bourbon, some butterscotch and caramel sweetness, tobacco, vanilla, oak, leather, and a hint of smoke. Coffee and earthy bitterness lingers, tamed by hints of bourbon sweetness.

The mouthfeel is thick, rich, oily, and fudgy. Ample carbonation prevents it from being too sludgy.

This is a wonderful BBA stout. Rich in flavor, doesn't detract from the flawless base beer.",4.5
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"As an erstwhile Colorado native I proclaim this to be an excellent bourbon barrel aged stout. Personally I like the regular Ten Fiddy better, which I admit is strange. But that said, Oskar Blues did a fantastic job finding the right blend of bourbon barrels to impart a variety of interesting, well balanced nuances to the base stout.

Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with purple undertones. The beer has a modest sized dark beige head, that also has some purple undertones which faded fairly quickly to a nice ring. Nice looking Imperial Stout and the purple undertones are a nice touch..

Smell: Prominent raspberries, moderate Bourbon aromas and brown sugar aromas, and mild roasted malts/coffee aromas. The beer has a good nose featuring the raspberries.

Taste: The palate features raspberries, moderate bourbon notes, modest chocolate and roasted malt notes. The taste profile is nicely balanced and while the raspberries are very apparent all the flavor elements work well together. The beer starts off fairly sweet but dries up a bit. The beer has a mild alcohol presence for the listed 14.56% ABV.

Dragonsaddle,"Canned on 9/30/20; consumed on 10/18/20

Pours a turbid mango-gold body topped with a rounded, fluffy two and a half fingers of white foam; excellent head retention leaves a mound of cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a moderate spread of soapy, spotty lacing around the walls of the glass.

Aroma shows traces of resin as it opens, withholding overripe peach, papaya, hints of bready malt, and guava briefly as the bouquet develops; creamier tones of mango build, further accentuating guava, tangerine zest, and slight suggestions of peach and pink grapefruit over time; a lush, tropical bouquet with defined, hoppy edges.

Taste offers lime sherbet upfront, a semi-tart introduction to what is eventually a touch piney over the mid-palate and effectively accented with peppery, pithy citrus zest; pineapple, bay leaf, and apricot zest show depth into the back end as overripe mango and sweet bready malts shine into the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body alongside a mild carbonation deferring to a significant creamy texture dominant into the mid-palate, where a prickly resin into the back end glides toward an increasingly slick, stiff, yet easy finish.

A great entry into the NETIPA category, perpetuating in equal parts the tempered abrasion matched by the burly profile which can be found in this (sub-) style; a pointed alcohol presence, abundance of flavor, and creamy, weighted texture to tie it all together; spectacularly consumable 11.5% ABV.",4.25

Big fan here.",4.25

Immense dark malt sweetness greets the palate; milk chocolate; coffee and caffeine; bourbon tones bleed midway through the malt sweetness and linger through the finish. Heavy body; dense, sticky residual sugars; huge alcohol warmth permeates through the density.

Kentuckley,"Brief Review:

O: First Transient review for me I believe. Never really got into these guys as I'm more old school. But they're really making a name for themselves with the -uckley series with 2 of them in the Top 250 now. Most recent 2021 edition here, haven't seen 2022's yet. This one comes a bit hot for me. Little boozy and tingly on the tongue. Aroma is a little suppressed. Reminds me a bit of Vanilla Noir from Prairie if it had some maple syrup in it. Otherwise the pour and mouthfeel are nice and slick, which is impressive. It's a darn good beer, not gonna lie, but maybe not world-class for me right now.

Recommendation: Decent offering from Transient here. They make a ton of BA stuff with lots of variants, so hard to get anything to stand out.",4.25

750ml corked/caged bottle served in a tulip. Bottling date 08/26/2020. Bought it earlier today at Chuck's Hop Shop Seward Park. It was expensive.

Pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head -- a thin white ring around the glass, with sparse carbonation. Fairly hazy. Smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness.

Taste is similar -- rich berry jam, more on the oak and less on the acid, almost a funk to it, and something that hints at a butteriness, not diacetyl, but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer. Moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very dry. Overall, this is a very good beer.",4.25
Schaarbeekse Kriek,"750ml brown bottle, caged and corked. Label has bottling date of '08/26/2020', with best before date of '10/26/2040'.

Notes on label: ""For this Schaarbeekse Kriek, we macerated locally grown and manually harvested sour cherries for almost fourteen months in wooden barrels, with both one-year and two-year old lambik. The final fruit intensity is about 318 grams of Schaarbeekse per litre of finished Schaarbeekse Kriek. The average age of this beer upon release will be at least two-and-a-half years.""

Clear, cherry red colored body. Fizzy head quickly disappeared. No lacing.
Aroma is cherry, funk and oak. Funk is more leather and tobacco like. Indications of sourness but the oak gives off an old wood fibe.
Taste is quite sour, each sip leaves the mouth dry. There is a sour cherry flavor that still gives off a brief hint of fruit sweetness. At this time the funk flavor is showing less than what is in the nose, but remains in the leather and tobacco expression. Has quite a bit of oak tannins, especially on the exhale of the breath and in the released air from the stomach.
Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.
Very good fruited lambic, although could likely increase more complexity and funk expression with bottle aging.",4.25
Schaarbeekse Kriek,"Bottle, at Plan B, Copenhagen. Beautiful red colour, pink head. Delightful cherry aroma. Sour cherry flavour on a funky background. A very good kriek lambic.",4.25

Red Eye November,"2021 release. Bottle to tumbler.

Look: Jet black with with lots of tiny floaters looking like golden stardust. No head. No lacing.

Smell: Malty, sweet and boozy. Clear notes of rye, molasses and coffee.

Taste: The rye is very present with the molasses adding sweetness, the coffee bitterness. Dark chocolate is there, malty and woody hints as well. The boozy barrel notes keep everything together very nicely.

Feel: Full and thick. Rather creamy than syrupy. Very low carbonation.

Overall: At first, the combination of rye, molasses and coffee didn't sound too promising to me as I'm not a big fan of any of the three flavors in my stouts. However, in this case every single one of them adds to a perfectly balanced taste which, together with the creamy mouthfeel, results in a fantastic beer.",4.75
Red Eye November,"2021 release - batch 5. 13.3% ABV. Poured from a 500mL bottle into a snifter.

Clear (?) seal brown liquid with a faint tan collar. Vague sheen of tears; no head development.

Rich, balanced aromas of coffee, roast malt, chocolate covered cherries, faint pipe tobacco, and molasses; perhaps an earthy hop note at times.

Unctuous palate entry suffused with all the flavors from the nose, dialed up. Bittersweet chocolate, bright stone fruit/berry notes, leading to layers of cocoa, loam, treacle, and toasted brown sugar. Malt exhibits moderate roast qualities, but more forward character comes from the coffee and barrel. No char. Low bitterness. Medium-dry finish. Decent complexity, but more focus on balance and smoothness I think.

Oily, rich, medium-full body with dangerously disguised alcohol.

Excellent example of the style, although, perhaps, the base beer is a touch subdued. Maybe not the best value, but I won't dock any points for that...",4.5
Red Eye November,"Midnight black oily pour with a brown head. The nose is essentially a perfect ba coffee stout nose, and thus elevated the overall score a bit: huge and full coffee with tones of bean and grounds plus earth, bittersweet dark chocolate, rye, dried date, plus huge rich barrel notes with an emphasis on the molasses and vanillin laiden bourbon, wow. Taste has brighter complexion with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, and barrel is not as powerful, loses the rye and some earth tones, but still excellent. Feel is chewy yet medium bodied, good barrel with the warmth in particular, but coffee is the clear star with roast and percolation for days. Overall just a little shy of being one of the greats, but the smell is there",4.75
Red Eye November,"Pours a deep black color with a light brown colored head that leaves a little lacing down the glass. Smells of the deep roasted malt base, sweet molasses, and a nice blast of earthy coffee at the end. Tastes of sweet molasses, coffee, toffee, a hint of spicy rye at the end. Thick, smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, excellent feeling and excellent beer!",4.75
Flora,B7,4.5
Flora,"A: Retention becomes an accelerated rupture shortly after the discharge, which emanates a willowy throw-over. Nonetheless, the preceding kick-off presents a spumescent elegance, as the stretch reaches to inches ahead of that ensuing regression. That initial onset categorizes those collared inches from Arabian Oryx to shredded coconut, before the unseating takes a painter’s knife to the pebbly brim. Just below is a presentation on appearance that succumbs the Golden Shield Lichen, with a Tuscan sun appeal. The output continues with intermittent transfers, which later transcribe hues in chartreuse, as shades of dim scarlet calmly intersect. During the walk, a growing classiness from air drafts of duration, which polish an engraving collar endowment with coupled calm clarity

S: Entryway is greeted by an involvedness preempted by esters, and a countryside funk that’s just setting off. In that regard, the indulgence stretches across citrus fruits with a ploughed rusticity that incises the herbed wheat kindly. The scents carry on towards cameo apples besides the pear drop to honey bananas, while pink & white grapefruit alloy the baboon lemon kind of limes. There’s a touch of grainy malt, for the cracker-y moments, which respect the advancing yeast properties to umbrella remote spices. In the interim, a distant dank earthiness, for fresh hay and cut pastures, while pulling a dragged mustiness out from barnyard phenols. The aerated openness channels oak to the finer points inside dry/calibrated wine, as a background frowzy lays horse blankets atop cellar moths. The forward march is neatly acidic, while continuing to press earthy must on fading rose petals, before the dry & brittle antiques of wooden leather

T: A mineralogy reading, for foretaste to indulge, with the accompanying fruit + spices relating to the harvested derives. Inferences campaign on earthy farmsteads with feedlot jazz and cultivated tobacco, as a tempered acidity roots crimson red rhubarbs. On balance, a light malt baking to field hops with a toasted spiciness, while yeast properties grind along a rural bitterness. Accordingly, grassy provinces with situated granaries that stow garnered wheat. The vintage addresses contextual funk, and pushes agricultural sulfates thru river rock mulch, as fungus builds upon the air-dry acclimations. There’s a developing cue of Grüner Veltliner, by the elongated pour for grape tinges, and a furtherance for cellar natures. To that end, a docility on acidity, as notations add oddity for woodlot ecology and slurry manure, afore dry skin briefcases

M: A bright, light buoyancy with antiquated funk, and sharp vibrancy. The allotted span comes with arbitrated tartness, which is moderated throughout, as a compliment to the progressed barrenness. Thus, a thrilling attenuation that styles effervescence handily, as the timed exposure madcaps the resounding involvedness from side to side upon the clean-complete finish

O: An environmental showcase that harvests funk habitually, with a touch of wheat malt in back to weigh hop efficiency. The moment of service is a period of effectiveness, given the dry bite for the webbed yeast densities and age aligning land-locks",4.5
Flora,I had the 2016 version which is a blend of Florence age for 18 months in a selection of wine barrels whose providence includes art and civil disobedience number 10. Very good beer.,4.5
Flora,"Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a large foamy head. Aroma of funky Brett notes with some tartness, oak and light acidity notes also perceptible. Taste is a mix of funky Brett notes, oak, tart notes with subtle acidic notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Interesting saison with right amount of complexity.",4.25
Coolship Red,"This is likely spot-on for style, but a bit too much pucker for me. Pours a beautiful berry-red with a quick-fading cap of white. Aroma is heavenly raspberry and very mild funk. Flavors are delicious as well, with tons of berry dominating. Very tart. So tart. But, I don't review so much for style attributes, but whether I enjoy. This one took me 2 sittings.",4.25
Coolship Red,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, as part of the beatings he delivered during NBS BIF #15. 12.7oz Cork and Caged bottle (Packaged Dec 3 2020) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a lovely dark red color with about 1/8 inch of pink head that quickly dissipated and left no lacing.

The aroma was solidly full of raspberry, with just a light bit of grain in the background.

On the tongue, a big hit of bitterness punches the front of the palate, with raspberry dominating the rest.

The body was light, crisp, had decent carb, and a very dry finish.

Drinkability was very good, I'd like to have regular access to this.

Overall, a very good beer. A must-try if you see it.",4.25
Coolship Red,"375ml bottle from 2012.

Pours dark copper with a burgundy tinge. Quickly fizzling head with zero retention or lacing. Fairly evident raspberries in the nose with faint cider vinegar and diaper. Light bodied with a slickish, limp mouthfeel. Raspberries on the palate with a solid tartness but short of sour or jammy. Finishes with a nice balance of tart and raspberries.",4.0

Coolship Red,"12.7oz corked and caged on 12/3/20. Opened 1-16-22.
1/2"" pink tinted head, limited retention and ends up as a partial cap and ring. No lacing. The beer is a glowing red/purple with very good clarity - beautiful color. Tart raspberry, oak, light funk, and vinous quality in the nose. Awesome tart raspberry flavor, bright, rich fruit with bracing acidity. Light body, bright entry, medium acid, all in a dry, tart fruit-filled finish. Outstanding.",4.25
Coolship Red,"Pours a vibrant red with low pink head.

Smell is tart and vinous with notes of fresh raspberries, raspberry jam, lime, oak and bit of funk.

Taste is phenomenal. Tart with tons of fresh raspberries and a bit of jam. Dry and vinous with notes of peach, oak, funk and a bit of bitterness. Nice acidity and tremendous balance.

Mouthfeel is medium and dry with effervescent carbonation.

Overall, a stunning beer. I am a huge fan for raspberries in beer, and this is close to the daddy, Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus.",4.75
Coolship Red,Ruby red color somewhat translucent. Licorice and raspberry on the nose. Candied raspberry tart taste with some very yeast notes. Really pops in the mouth; crisp. Lots of flavors here. Solid beer.,4.5
Coolship Red,"Very interesting and complex ale. First, this is definitely a sour. I usually do not like sours but this is definitely one I will keep drinking. The nose is a very light raspberry with a hint of yeast or fruit wine influence. It is a beautiful deep red color. The taste definitely has a fruit wine influence with a subtle bubbly or spicy finish. Overall a fantastic well made beer, especially if you enjoy raspberries.",4.5
Coolship Red,"Appearance - The beer was pinkish red is color with white bubble clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell -,The nose brought to mind vinegary red berries.

Taste - There was a lot of raspberry in the taste, but I also detected some tart cherries. It was surrounded by a vinegary presence. The profile was tart, but did not remove tooth enamel. Sourness was lessened by a dry finish.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was fairly intense, allowing for a dry finish.

Overall - This was a fine, well balanced sour.",4.5
Coolship Red,"Look: beautiful, opaque garnet red. Soft white head evaporates quickly; no lace. Ring of tiny bubbles along the glass.

Smell: subtle sour raspberries. Some funk. All gorgeous.

Taste: sharp, tangy, sour raspberry with some funk and vinegar. Beautiful rich fruit with sharp notes taking it up and up.

Feel: Lots of sharp, active, elevating tiny bubbles. Sharp on the tongue in the best possible way.

This is a magnificent beer. All angles, sharpness, acid, funk, and fruit. And bubbles. It's alive...",4.5
Coolship Red,"Caged and corked bottle dated dec3.,2020 and opened May 16,2021

Aroma is tart raspberries

Taste is tart , raspberry , and more tart , hint of apricot , the funk is there

Very tart , fizzy sudsing , tart bone dry finish

Good beer",4.25
Coolship Red,I want more funk. The raspberry character is big but the beer lacks depth. Would love to get some musty barnyard or brett character to provide some dimension. Wouldn't buy again.,3.5
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours pitch black with a finger of dark mocha head. Aroma and taste giving off loads of roasted malt, peat, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, black cherry, prune, caramel, molasses, tobacco, drying oak tannin, significant bourbon, nice amount of vanilla. Low full body. Oily, sticky, silky. A gigantic beer that doesn't disappoint. Well done as expected.",4.5
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle, package date of 11/17/21. Pours black with a very small sized brown head. Smells of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, dark fruit, dark roasted malt, and earthy hops. The taste follows exactly. Good intensity and balanced flavors. Moderate bitterness and dryness in the finish. Above average body and low carbonation. Overall this is a great barrel aged RIS; strong yet smooth and drinkable.",4.5
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Many thanks to Erland for sharing this one. Pkgd 11/17/21. 13.4% ABV, 12oz bottle.
Pours out to a syrupy thick ink black, forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention, sparse lacing. The nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all love...prunes, dark chocolate, raisins, figs, soy sauce and black walnut. Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy, dense bodied. Medium light carbonation, ~2.25 carbs or so. Taste is a recap of the nose. The bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional Expedition. Bitterness is mild and earthy, hops are kept in check by copious malts. Considering the rich complex malts, there is no sourness or astringency here...this easily happens in lesser RIS's if the roasted malts are overdone. One is enough. It's a heavy hitter and very rich. This might be great over dark chocolate ice cream. Hrmmm. Might have to try that.",4.5
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Black in color with no light penetration. There's a fingernail of brown around the rim. The aroma is of piney hops and dark malt. I'm tasting piney hops and sweet bourbon. The mouth is thick and chewy.,4.25

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,I have to say I liked this one much better once it warmed up. Before it warmed up it there was a big chocolate taste with some barrel. After it warmed the other flavors started to pop. The chocolate faded a bit and vanilla and coffee flavors became more present. The barrel also came to the forefront. A bit thin but very good overall.,4.25
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottled 11/17/2021 poured into a snifter at 47° Fahrenheit 13.4% ABV. The beer pours pitch black with zero light penetration and minimal light brown head. The head recedes to an irregular ring and leaves a few tiny spots of lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, deeply charred oak barrel, bourbon, coffee and chocolate fudge. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. No alcohol presence in the aroma or taste, which is incredible for the ABV. Overall, excellent to world class. The balance is key. All the tastes are wonderfully integrated.",4.5
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Look - Just fantastic black and thick with a big thick tan head and some great lacing. How a BBA stout should look

Pours black, brown along the edges, with essentially no head. Smell is boozy, bourbon, vanilla, oak, and very dark chocolate / dark roasted coffee.

Taste is boozy and super anise-y. Lots of roasty bitterness, lots of boozy sweetness. Fairly soft and well-balanced, actually.

Mouthfeel is thick and fluffy. Overall, very nice.",4.25

12oz bottle poured into a tulip

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger creamy dark khaki head that reduces to a thin ring around the glass

S- huge barrel aromas on the nose; spicy oak, barrel juice, caramel and vanilla. Bold aromas of chocolate brownie batter, dark chocolate, molasses, mocha cream, anise, charred malt, figs & raisins. Just a hint of underlying piney hops and booze

T- bold barrel notes lead the way with strong barrel juice, peppery oak and complimenting notes of caramel and vanilla. Mid-palate brings out notes of brownie batter, chocolate fudge, herbal coffee, charred malt, black licorice and figs. The finish gives more bold barrel juice and a hint of piney hops. Lingers of bourbon and brownie batter

M- heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a thick and creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety warming finish

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Vintage 2020/5/18
This officially serves to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that not *everything* from 2020 was a dumpster fire.
Appearance is amazing, maybe because I was so ready for a beer, but few beers have looked better. Black with dark brown highlights and a thin brown head.
The aroma was malts and plums and raisins and more malts. The taste. I literally said “wow” - (I was so ready for this) just so smooth without sharp edges typically found in RISs, maybe the bourbon, maybe the aging, can’t say, but wow.
The feel, obviously IMO, but it struck me as ideal for the genre. Viscous but not too much. And I mentioned smoothness earlier, oh yes.
So glad they are in Michigan. Thanks Larry for this.",4.75
Miller Genuine Draft 64,"Been holding off reviewing this one because I was going back and forth on considering it a straight up light beer, which I rated it as. It is jut below poor and at the high end of terrible. It is extremely watery and flat tasting. If I were to rank it as a low calorie brew and solely as such, I would rank it at about 2.5. Halfway between poor and average",1.75
Miller Genuine Draft 64,"Look - very pale/clear.

Smell - you ever smell a used beer can that you found on the ground when you were a kid? That's what this smells like.

Taste - fizzy and watery. It literally is reminiscent of tonic water or soda. Very carbonated.

Feel - worse than the taste or the smell is the feel. It's so bubbly and carbonated on your pallette it feels like a Sprite.

Overall - look, any beer that has it's caloric intake in it's name wasn't made to be good. If you're on a diet that restricts how many calories you consume this is a decent replacement for a regular light beer (Miller lite, Bud light, Coors light). The reviews of those beers will let you know you're just substituting terrible beers with a really watered down terrible beer though.",1.75
Miller Genuine Draft 64,"Had one at the golf course, and while it wasn't that great it was better than I thought it would be--good enough, I feel for a short review. So here's the review:

Pretty much indistinguishable from Miller Lite.

That's sort of impressive, considering its caloric lightness (which in beers such as Michelob Ultra and the other Miller 64 create a weird aroma that's like dirty socks). Grainy start, and a hoppy finish that is light but still discernibly hoppy. Totally drinkable.",2.5
Miller Genuine Draft 64,"Super straw yellow color, the usual mixture of a ton of a water and very little barley. Flimsy white head props up and hits the bricks right quick. Aroma of almost nothing.

Taste of almost nothing. Highly carbonated and watery. On the plus side, you can drink this and hydrate, without worrying about the water quality from some 3rd world shithole if you come across this abroad.

I guess there are no off flavors, so in terms of taste you can't dock it too hard, but mouth feel, jeez, its overly carbonated water that had some shitty beer spilled into it.",2.0

Miller Genuine Draft 64,"This CANQuest (tm) originally took place on 05-09-2010.

Another one that I CANnot believe that I have not reviewed previously. Anything in support of the CANQuest, I suppose.

First, let me say that when this first hit the market back in the late-1980's, I was a HUGE fan in its unleaded version. Regular was much better then its High Life counterpart and this beat Lite six ways to and on Sunday. After I toured the Miller plant in MKE for the first time, in 1992, I was hooked. Today? Let's see ...

From the outset, it had both similarities and contrasts with its leaded version (MGD). I got a nice couple of fingers of bone-white head with lousy retention. Samey-same. Color was a paler shade of golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Close to samey-same. Nose was still filled with adjuncts, especially corn, but not as prevalent. Pretty much samey-same. Mouthfeel was watery and there was not any real taste. It was so innocuous as to wonder why bother. Finish was mighty tasteless, stripped of any fabric of beer. Colored water. Feh. I might as well have had some water. At least my caloric intake was low. Sheesh.

This one's badge/patch may now be in jeopardy.",1.5

Budweiser Select 55,"Here's a review of a beer had years ago. Tough to keep track of where your reviews went with so many online beer places these days (and difficult entities that overmod). Pours a similar color to that which you see in the clear bottle. Not a lot of grain here, gotta count those calories. Concentrated urine color, thin head eviscerates itself in the 1/8"" range. Barely discernable grain qualities in the nose. Lager yeast not there.

Taste is a highly carbonated light grain meets mineral water qualities. They didn't go hard, or even a below average amount with the hops. I'm sure they used some super high alpha acid no flavor kind. There is no there there. There aren't ""off flavors"" per se, but there is definitely a lacking of flavor. 2.4% almost makes you wonder 'what's the point'?

Nonetheless, the beer does seem to accomplish what it is going for. Ugh this is one of those double digit positive rate deviations for a beer I don't care for. Oh well.",2.25
Budweiser Select 55,"this is pretty bad, but from an ice cold can, i prefer it to many of its peers in the same segment. its not metallic, its not sweet, its not overly cheap tasting to be honest, and its also not nothing, which counts for me, id rather have a little adjuncty character and a slightly appreciable lager yeast element than no flavor at all, and thats what we have here. drink it fast, because it warms up like garbage, but there are definitely worse beers than this. its not even that watery for how light it is, the high carbonation helps with that. i wouldnt make a day of it, but one in isolation is fine. it does start to taste like the can a little bit towards the bottom, and there is a decided absence of hops, even for the style, but i really cant hate on this too hard. one thing i like about it is that it does sort of taste like a classic bud, albeit a little lesser version, but you can tell its from the same family of lagers, and i find that appealing for some reason as i sip on this. more of a pounder than anything, not as bad as everyone says...",2.0

Natural Light,"12 oz can
Consumed 21Aug, 2022
Glass: 333mL Pokal [don't make this mistake - drink it out of its can]
Temp at Pour: ice cold


Look:
Clear pale straw yellow that is full of bubbles. Initial 4-finger foamy white head dissipates fairly quickly to a ring-and-island. Good lacing is left along the glass.

Smell:
Very mild but sweet biscuit dough with a noticeable lemon note. There is also a mineral or really a metallic note as well.

Taste:
Faint sweetened corn and light but syrupy malts. The mineral/metallic note from the nose is in the taste. A very mild bitterness shows up quickly. The sip dries out a tad at the end.

Feel:
Quite watery. Well carbonated. Body is very thin.

Overall:
A somewhat passable light AAL. It doesn't really taste like much. But it's cheap, it's beer, and it kinda tastes like beer. Fine for a hot day after mowing the lawn or at the shore (where other beers cost 2-3 times as much). Drink it ice cold, drink it in it's can, and don't let it warm up.

Also known as an ""Eastern Shore Cocktail"" in parts of Maryland.",3.0
Natural Light,"Poured from a 25oz can best by December 22 2022

On the pour a surprising fine white 3 finger head formed on a straw body with fine active carbonation. Over a few mi uses the head lost half of its height but I've seen a whole lot worse retention. Some light lacing.

Aroma is bad slightly farty, possibly from crap hops or rushed lager yeast who really knows I could be both based on the smell. Then a light adjunct sweetness mixed with a little BO.

Taste is better than the aroma but a bit of rushed lager funk is still there followed by a light but corny sweetness that fades into vague syrupy light malts. For the most part it tastes like it should.

Feel is a bit uncarbonated at first but then some sort of dryness creeps in and makes you feel like it was carbonated? A bit confusing and not the greatest. Definitely light tho. Medium to short finish.

Overall it is what it is. It's certainly not ""good"" but I've consumed much more offensive things as well. It's cheap it's beer, and it tastes a bit like beer too.",2.5
Natural Light,This is a beer that's a favorite amongst a poor crowd. I can't get drunk with it and all it does is make you have to piss all night long. On top of that it tastes like they used urine instead of hops in the recipe. I think I'll pass on giving it a proper review because it's not really even worth it. Remember the generic beer back in the 80's and the beer can was white and just said beer? Well they gave it a name and it's called Natural Light. Natural Light would be a better name in the craft beer business but oh well it got slapped on the world's shittiest beer and is forever ruined,1.5

$2 @ ShopRite #519, Phila., PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: Well it's definitely light in color. It's a crystal clear straw gold beneath a short cap of white foam that's dropping before my eyes. I made sure that I have a ""beer clean"" glass so it's not that. The aroma is sweetish, and although you can tell that there's some grain there it's not much. It's brewed with ""cereal grains"" but I don't know what they are, probably rice. I also think I'm getting more fruitiness here than hops which is weird. On to the taste... it tastes like it smells. It's sweetish, very mildly grainy, a touch fruity, and with minimal hop notes. It doesn't really taste like beer to me and I wonder why people who consider themselves beer drinkers drink this. It's like sugar water to be honest. It's 4.2% ABV with just 95 calories and 3..2 grams of carb per can which is pretty good, so at least there's that. It's light bodied and gently crisp then smooth across the tongue. In the end you can tell that it's fairly well made but it's definitely not the best light beer out there, at least if you want something that taste more like beer than it does a malternative.

Flavor : A faint bit of mashed veggies which disappears rather quickly and develops into more of a roasted fire corn flavor. Faint club soda and brown potato skin finish off the taste.

Mouthfeel : A bit more present than the Coors N/A that I had last night. Very carbonated, on the heavy side of light bodied, ends sparkling like club soda.

Keystone Light,"Poured from an undated 12oz can

On the pour a cloudy completely white head forms which recedes to 1cm relatively quickly then slows down and receded to a decent cap over a few minutes, it never goes headless. Carbonation is strong on a golden straw body. It tries to lace but the ring becomes saggy.

Aroma is essentially all cheap lager off flavor. Likely mistreated yeast, but it comes off as a bit tart. Behind that is a hint of malt and corn. Very light and no real hops to be picked up on.

Flavor is similar to the aroma however loses a lot but not all of the tartness. Behind that is a slight bitterness and a sweet corny maltiness. Overtime converts to a dry finish. Not the worst but pretty boring. It's light as it promised.

Feel is decent for the pricepoint. Smooth and almost creamy from the head with a decently long finish, and once you get over the smell a pretty good crispness. Once again very light.

Overall a decent but flawed cheap ass beer. Pretty close to piss water with a hint of grain. For a light beer I'd say it's pretty good. It's been a long time since I've had coors light, and honestly I'd say this has more flavor.",2.25
Keystone Light,"I try not to be snobby when it comes to beer. Or rather, I try to meet beer on its own terms. Craft beers are trying for depth, complexity, and deliciousness. They hold themselves to an elevated standard - they're meant to be a great experience, not just a beverage.

Macro beer is different. Much like fast food is to fine dining, macro beer is designed to be cheap, plain, and inoffensive. Most macros, including this one, are just that. White bread and mineral flavors, no real head or hops profile, highly carbonated and refreshing cold. There are, of course, bad beers in the cheap category. Ones that fail to be boring, and are instead gross (Steel Reserve, for instance.) This brew, Keystone Light, serves its purpose; to be a casual beverage, much like tea or soda. A lot less sugar, so it's probably better for you than soda, actually, unless you're killing a case.

When I come home from a long day of work, and I don't feel like writing tasting notes or looking through the china cabinet for the right glass, I'll happily knock back a few cans of this, or maybe some Miller Lite, for a decent buzz and a deeper sleep.

Natural Ice,"Look - poured from a 12 oz can. Pale yellow in color, with actually a sizable head that has some retention, which mostly dissipates after about a minute.

Smell - corn, syrup, and just a tad bit of funkiness. some alcohol comes through in the smell as well if it's warm enough.

Taste - when drank cold, tastes like just about any other adjunct: light, slightly sweet, and a subtle malty finish. however, if it warms, the beer really does taste nasty. in particular, the booziness really comes through, which is rough and reminiscent of gasoline. just drink it cold.

Feel - light bodied, high carbonation, and boozy for its type at 5.9%

Overall - despite the fact that I wrote a full review, Natty Ice really isn't meant to be analyzed. When it's cold, it drinks like any adjunct lager and gets you where you want to be quicker. however, if you sit around and start trying to pick out the flavors, that's when it starts to get nasty.

Overall: One could think about drinking a beer and it would be more like drinking a beer than drinking this beer. When the calories were cut, so were the taste and ABV. This is the opposite of a too high and intrusive ABV beer.",1.75

Miller 64,"You ever get the feeling you're having a product for the last time, not because you aren't into it, but because its days are numbered on the production line? MillerSeltzer about to gentrify this neighborhood of beer. If Tomorrow Never Comes, will this beer know how much I meh her?

Just look at the dang color of this beer through its clear bottle. Dude, Who Spilled Light Beer in My Water? They go hard on the carbonation as this fizzes upward with the pour, but retention is like Raineer Wolfcastle doing comedy. That's the joke. The aroma lacks 3/4 of the beer components, and the one it has, water, well, its not supposed to be aromatic. And that's about the best where this beer is concerned: where it does almost nothing.

Taste is an afterthought, this is just meant to be something wet to consume after you run a 100 mile marathon or something. Or maybe you make an ass of yourself when you drink and you need these to keep yourself in check. The thing is, notions of malt, hops and yeast are completely lost on this beer.

L: polished-clear, pale gold liquid; initially curiously lasting, glistening sponge of off-white foam - did leave a long, broad, crystalline band of lace at the top

S: urinal cake, delicate spicy-floral overtone; grain aroma like rye flour... like a High Life, stripped of its substance; not meant to be smelled?

T: grassy-bitter bite atop (again) a floury grain flavor, very subtle flash of cereal grain in the finish, but very little malt definition altogether; nearly bone dry... moderate peppery phenolic spice is all that's left humming on the palate

F: no definition to its thin body; mildly sharp and spritzy; remarkably dry with just that soft spicy warmth lingering

O: could be the glass altering the presentation of its aromas?... regardless, execution-wise a wonderfully dry, but more parching than refreshing drink; flavor-wise virtually flavorless - comes with the territory for a low-abv, low-calorie beer... one should really just abstain if this is what one's reduced to (1551)",2.75

It's made to get a person buzzed and save a few bucks. The taste and carbonation remind me of Miller Lite or Coors light..leaning more towards Coors. There is a slight aftertaste which I don't experience in the pricier pisswater ranges...but honestly; I stopped noticing after the second can. Smells and looks like cheap beer to me! Mouthfeel is right up there with any other light beer. Taste is like I said, somewhere between Miller and Coors slightly sweeter and with a short, dirty aftertaste. Of course it's not top-notch, but look at that price tag! Red Dog isn't even this cheap most of the time and that's one of two beers (along with side pocket) that are undrinkable to me. It's not as sweet nor as nasty and off-putting as some of the ones that there are for the same amount of money in my area (Boxer, Lost Lake, Red Dog, Side Pocket, any HG product, Icehouse, etc).

Milwaukee's Best Light,"I was attracted to this one because of the price, and the alcohol volume/calorie count ratio. This is about two dollars more per case than Genny Light (the cheapest light beer in my area), and has a higher alcohol content and fewer calories (more akin to its pricier cousin, Miller Lite.)

Look: Just decent. Lighter in color than Miller Lite, with a similar foamy head that diminishes quickly but clings to my pilsner glass. Better than Busch, Keystone, or almost any other budget light lager.

Smell: Nothing. Seriously, this smells like water that was poured out of a glass that once contained beer. Not winning any awards here.

Taste: Grainy, in a cheap AAL way, but not at all offensive. No cooked veggie taste, decent malt backbone for a light. Absolutely zero hop flavor, making it less complex than Miller Lite. Pretty good, much better than Keystone or any other competing bottom-shelf light.

Feel: Where this beer shines! Almost champagne-like in a Miller High Life kinda way. Excellent carbonation retention all the way through, contributing to that clingy head. No slick oily finish, as you get with Busch or Keystone.

Overall: Almost too easy to drink, and at this price point it's tough to resist. There are few better alternatives.",2.25
Milwaukee's Best Light,"L - Pours a straw yellow color with good head retention and lacing. Not as pale as other macro light beers.

S - Sweet malts and corn with a little hops. Predictably less strong scented than Beast Ice, but similar profile.

T - Tastes just like the smell. Corn and malts, tastes like crackers. Hops is little more than a pleasant aftertaste. Watery like any light beer, but very grainy and refreshing.

Overall - I have had very few light beers, but this is a personal favorite in the category. Very refreshing and inoffensive taste. A great beer for parties or relaxing at home. Better than the ""premium"" light beers, especially Bud Light.",3.0

Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit too fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread, light biscuit dough, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Solid robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Nicely clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, fairly bready/grainy, and lightly sticky hop mouthfeel that is good. Pretty thin, but not watery finish. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.1%. Overall this is a decent light adjunct lager style. Solidly flavorful for the ABV. Nice clean malt/grains and decent earthy hop balance. Was a bit too heavy on the fruity corn notes, but definitely enjoyable for the style. Identical to regular MB with a lighter body, and without sacrificing much if any flavor.",3.5

On the pour a decent 3 finger foamy white fine head formed that dissipates at a medium rate to a decent cap and ring. Carbonation is fine and the body is a golden light straw. Some lacing, decent.

Aroma has some Metallic smell alongside a very light lager yeast that isn't the most crisp, but I was expecting worse. Slight tartness, but a decent but super light crackery malt. Quite light but better than expected.

Taste follows the aroma with some vague off notes but nothing terrible. No hop bitterness and a light crackery barley. Quite watery tasting.

Feel is light and carbonated. Pretty nice, amd the finish isn't instant either. Super drinkable, and not as close to seltzer as michelob ultra.

Overall this is a decent light beer. Better than coors light, keystone, natty, and michelob ultra. About on par with miller lite however. It's a light beer its close to water but not the closest.",2.75

$1.79 @ Carool's Discount Liquor, Merchantville, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's a good thing I bought ""THE BIG ONE"" seeing as how this is rated ""Awful"" on beeradvocate. Ehh, it was only $1.79 and I got to get 'the eye' for going into a store in Camden, NJ that I damned well knew I shouldn't be in. (I know, I know, it's technically Merchantville - I can't figure out how that's possible - but it's a block away from what's technically Camden). What can I say, I like the weirdo beers and malt liquors! It's poured a clear straw gold body beneath a finger's width of white foam. The head seems to be holding pretty well so it seems pretty good so far. The aroma is limited to a generic but clearly adjunct-enhanced beer. There are no real hops, just a smear in the background. On the upside it's clean, but this isn't a malt liquor, it's just 5.9% ABV so I wouldn't expect anything weird. On to the taste... it follows the aroma which is a good thing in that it's clean, but bad in that it's fairly boring; t here is a little bit of an apple-like fruitiness to it though. It's lightly sweetish and thus nicely balanced by a moderate bitterness and generic background hoppiness. The alcohol never shows but then again at 5.9% it shouldn't, although it is possible, I assure you. It finishes mainly dry with a very short lingering finish. It's basically the same beer from start to finish except that you get a little more malt upfront and the apple doesn't step in until mid-palate. I've had worse European light lagers that have had more character to them but weren't nearly as well made, and then there's the beers from the Baltic region and Russia that honestly seem like they've been brewed with anti-freeze. Of course in parts of Russia that could be a selling point - 'Whatever Beer - Keeps You From Freezing!"". So we're basically done here. In the mouth it's medium on the lighter side, and gently crisp-then-smooth.",3.25

Busch Ice,"Super Beer World reopened from the ashes of Beer World in PA. Now that 6 packs can be purchased in PA, there have been a ton of retail changes in Pittsburgh. BW was the primary supplier to me during my earliest reviews. Yuengling, Iron City and the beers they produced were purchased from this HUGE case store. Reopening as SBW, with a few special deals and a large 6 pack section, I thought to go old school and buy a cheap case. Busch? It was one of the first beers I consumed. I've only looked back on it to review it early in my BA reviews. So, how bad could Busch ICE be? It was 10.99 for the case.

L: Bubbly like soda. Light head and lace. Light yellow.

F: Watery. Minimal cream from foam. Alcohol remainder

There is a little oily/soapy aftertaste and feel but it's not terrible. Overall, not as bad as I expected. Previous Busch beers were more flawed IMO.

Smell: Faint wheat, grass, biscuit malts, wet cardboard. Unusual for the style, but not unpleasant.

Taste: Surprisingly decent. Most cheap ice beers have a nasty alcoholic burn to them; this one does not. It reminds me somewhat of Olde English malt liquor. Very smooth, kind of like the lighter Busch variants but with a little kick of banana/clove that does a good job of balancing out the alcohol.

Feel: Similar to Genesee Ice. It's lighter than your typical bottom-shelf ice beer, but still slick and gets worse as it warms up.

S: sweet apple juice, hay, mellow underbelly of cereal grain and masa... a fruity pancake?; soft hint of sweet esters... after sips, only faint, corn syrup/meal note cuts through

T: essence of an apple danish/muffin (apple, light almost doughy malt), just without sugary sweetness... after those first two sips, familiar lightly-pommed Kix cereal grainy flavor takes over... hints at syrupy sweet, but frayed-clipped on the back end, very mild watery finish... has similar vague phenolic banana note in aftertaste as Busch standard

F: lithe, comfortably light-bodied; nearly silky smooth viscosity; latent gas, but no real sizzle; mild perhaps alcohol 'legs' in the finish... just a dream drink from the glass

O: taste kind of straddles adjunct lager and malt liquor... not all that bad for an 'Ice', probably one of the better, more palatable ones I've had; dare say I liked it more and more as it went along... easily could have finished whole can, but will buy again!",3.75
Busch Ice,"Served from 25oz can into shaker glass. Standard lager appearance -- 2"" sudsy white head, mild lacing, pale straw color, moderate streaming bubbles. Aroma -mild toasted malt and slight corn sweetness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, frothy with a crisp, dry finish. Flavor of lightly toasted malt, cracker, a bit of corn, with a mild hop bite. Overall: a decent offering in the style.",3.0
Busch Ice,"Pours out a clear medium yellow color. Head is white with almost no retention. No lacing.
Smells a bit like banana. Could be the corn. There is also a faint graininess in the back but not much else.
Pretty light tasting for 5.9 abv. If its really cold that is. The cheap corn sweetness makes its appearance as the it warms.
Mouthfeel is light to medium bodies with high carbonation. Standard for the style.

It isnt too bad when cold. But as warms watch out.",2.0
Bud Ice,"Darker gold than regular Budweiser. Soapy loose head that doesn’t linger.
Smells very neutral.
Tastes like bread, crackers, malted grain, very little in the way of hops. Crisp with a surprisingly nice aftertaste. There’s a little alcohol heat on the backend as well, probably from being brewed with rice or corn syrup.
I think this beer gets a bad rap because it’s cheap, it also makes good micheladas if your into that.",4.0
Bud Ice,"only picked this one up because a fresh batch of 18 oz bottles came in and i figured, hell i hate budweisers line of products even after a fair shake of trying them. so may as well try this one too, since im a fair guy. first one had no carb, had to go get a replacement, short walk. this one, carbonation is fine. heyoooooooo. tastes the same as the previous bottle with no carbonation. but with bubbles. ya these things are just beer for bums to get buzzed in a blaze of time. Which i think makes it good for what it is, im just not lookin for it. on the ice beer scale, lower in terms of choice, if one had the options of course. not everyone is as fair as i.",2.25
Bud Ice,"Poured from an undated 12oz can.

On the pour a fizzy soda like head forms then quickly disappears entirely. Carbonation is very lively and the color is a yellow gold.

Aroma is rough. A bit of green apple off sweetness followed by a skunky note and finished by a rough bad smell that I couldn't say where it came from. Smells like expired cider even ice cold.

Flavor isuch better than the aroma fortunately with some malts actually present. Zero hops however. A fuel and alcohol flavor is present in the very back despite only being 5.5% abv. Has the same ricey light note as standard bud. Not the worst, bit not good. To be honest everything leading up to this had me expecting worse.

Feel is light watery and has a lot of co2 bite. Despite all its flaws, when ice cold this beer is relatively refreshing, and some head does form when sipped despite being headless in the glass. It gets the job done but it's still not great.

Overall this is just a cheaper stronger version of budweiser. If you like bud and are on a budget this might be fore you, but MHL is the same price and scores better in every category.",2.25
Bud Ice,Not bad for the price. Not a fan of the mouthfeel but this is one of the best bangs you can get for your buck. Legendary among alcoholics.,2.75

Rating beer means all beers, not just the good ones. So here we go....I would say it looks like piss, but a lot of beers do. Weak golden body, foamy head fizzes away. Aroma? Faint "" beer"" aroma ( remember college? Day old beer can empties?) Taste is weak grainy, malty flavors, but nothing horrific. Just not much of anything. Easily drinkable, would quench your thirst for sure. Just not a lot of flavor at all. I've had worse.",2.25
Bud Ice,A Nice strong Beer!,5.0
Bud Ice,To those who pour this in a glass to observe the taste/feel/aroma that’s like trying connect your iPhone to a 68 mustang stock radio. Just isn’t made for that purpose lol. This is a good beer after you mow the lawn or need something crisp. A smoking beer or a game with the buddies beer. Would I drink it every day? No. Would I drink it when I need a low priced buzz? Heck yeah. That’s the main reason they sell it in 16 oz cans. Don’t drink this if you want a “fancy beer” or “reviewable” this is as common as a Pepsi and should be drank as so. Enjoy my friends.,3.0
Bud Ice,"This beer is get drunk, it even comes in 40 ounces so the teens who know someone who want to look cool on the railroad tracks or at a shitty party they don't realize that 40 ounces of bud ice is not how much you can drink but how fast. Ever drink warm bud ice? The ass end of a bottle? WOOF! I only bought a case of this because of the dam penguins and getting beer I was too young for during the early 90s ICE wars. Budweiser admitted that their employees used to piss into the vats. Now we know why it has such a bad flavor. PASS THIS UP!",1.5
Bud Ice,"12oz bottle - bought this because it's infamous, review from notes:

This lives up to the awful legends about it. The best way I can describe it, and I'm not trying to be vulgar, this is just the best way to sum it up: it tastes how piss smells. And I wish I was kidding. Slightly sweet with a bite of alcohol, too. I don't know if this is a bad bottle, or what, and I don't care

curiosity satisfied",1.75
Bud Ice,"Revisited this vile piss because l told my wife to grab me some beer. She must hate me. Looks is fine, pale golden yellow, leaving light lacing down the glass as it sits. Smells like, well, nothing good, really. Faint corn, stale wet bread, just not good. Taste is absolutely horrid. Slightly sweet, with an unpleasant bitterness. Not a hops bitter, but a wtf did l just put in my mouth bitter. Almost like someone put a cig out in this thing and put it back in the fridge. Mouthfeel is not horrid, and probably the best quality of this crap. Glad l had the opportunity to show the can to my wife and explain to her how she should never desecrate my fridge with this ever again. So many better brews at the same price point. Effing disgusting. Avoid... just terrible.",1.25
Bud Ice,It's primary benefit is the price. It's very inexpensive. The beer itself is easy to drink and has decent carbonation. The smell of it may not be the best but if you can get past that it's a decent brew. I'm not a huge fan of ice brewed beer but this one is acceptable to my personal taste. I recommend trying it. Even just once.,3.0
Bud Ice,The best domestic beer made by budweiser good taste and good affect great price,5.0
Bud Ice,Bud ice is the true godfather among the ice beer family. Doesn't taste the best but what do you expect. No other Ice beer goes down as smooth and feels as good as a few crisp bud ices. Best enjoyed in a bottle and with a pack of American Spirits after a long day. Has a nice vintage look that clearly has not been updated since the '90s.,4.25
Bud Ice,"People gotta remember this is an iced bud light, not bud regular. It's low in calories and flavor, less than bud regular but you get a higher abv with the refreshing bite of a bud a light. I'm down with it, esp from a clear bottle on a hot day",4.0
Bud Ice,In the realm of ICE beers this is not bad the appearance is average smell average taste essentially like bud heavy with less bread taste and more of an Alcohol. Overall Average. I would not bother buying it for a party or any function. Would recommend just spending the extra 2-3 dollars a case and buy something better and crisper. For a ICE Beer I would recommend Labatt Maxx ICE over this.,2.75
Bud Ice,The penguin commercials were cool though.,2.0
Bud Ice,"Pours a piss yellow, classic among all cheap lagers, 1/2 inch frothy white head that leaves the glass quickly. Smells like straw & horse piss inside of a hay barn with a slight hint of malts. Taste certainly follows the nose, it is smooth, but it sure does leave a funky aftertaste. Full-bodied with a smooth finish. There is a reason why this beer is cheap & we all bought it for that reason. If it's ice cold it isn't all that bad.",1.5

Bud Ice,"Nothing quite singes the palette like that metallic Budweiser Ice flavor. Brewed for that fantastic can smoothness for an ice cold finish and a life ending hangover! After a few you’ll know it, both from the alcohol and the brick that is now in your stomach. The taste of a metal street pole will linger for a while, as will the masonry in your gut. Not advised for a drinking game, but it will get ya drunk. That’s about all it has going for it.",1.75
Bud Ice,"Ice cold (obviously) is the way to go for this one. This is my favorite ice brew edging out Beast Ice by a hair. Paid $1.19. Doesn’t smell like much and it’s smooth as hell.

Busch Light,Terrible beer but not the worst I’ve ever had. I broke down and bought two 25oz cans on the suggestion of a trusted friend who has a similar taste in beers and food as I do. I still trust him but I have no idea what he sees in this beer other than it’s rock-bottom price. He told me that he buys this beer to give to house guests that refuse to bring their own beer due to its cheapness and that it’s a great lean mowing beer that “tastes like nothing” and doesn’t ruin the palate for drinking craft beer later. Well. It doesn’t taste like nothing. It tastes like aluminum. It tastes like the damn can it’s in. Next time I’ll go with Bud Light.,1.0
Busch Light,"It's better than Bud Light. This is as close to sparkling water as a beer can get, barely any flavor but still edges out some of the other light beers out there just due to how chuggable it is. If you just want to get drunk this will do.",2.75

Extremely cheap beer and super refreshing in nice weather not even necessary for a hot day. Beer is super drinkable this “awful” rating it has is not deserved at all.

I get an actual hint of banana skin, a little tang and even slight sting--initially surprised that it's somewhat relatable to Miller Lite. However, it's a bit sweet and has a hint of ricey wax in the exhale, which is always a turnoff to me in these ""Light"" lagers.",2.0
Busch Light,"Pours horse piss pale yellow with a two-finger white head. Smells of hay barn funk, horse piss, & corn; also just a faint amount of beer.

Michelob Ultra,"Poured from a 25oz can best by Jan 12 2023

On the pour a 2 finger head that quickly dissipates to a small ring around the glass forms. Body is a light golden straw with active fine carbonation.

Aroma is better than a lot of beers in the category, but still very light and not great. A bit of a tart funk followed by a very very light corny maltiness. Extremely light.

Taste is again Extremely light but it is also extremely clean. Unfortunately it has a vibe that it is beer flavored seltzer as opposed to just watery tasting beer. Has some vague German lager notes but beyond that it's just so watery.

Feel is somehow nice and not too light. It is still extremely light but there is some malt in the feel and the head makes each sip pretty soft unlike an actual seltzer. Medium short finish and high carbonation bite. Still an extremely light feel.

Overall this beer is just about as close to sex in a canoe as you can get if you've heard that joke. If you haven't it's about the best example of ""fucking close to water"" that I've drank. Extremely clean however.",2.25
Michelob Ultra,Not sure why this beer is rated so poorly. It is what it says it is. It's an ultra light beer with little flavours. Pure summer beer to keep things light. Don't expect anything else. It pours a clear golden color with okay head. Corn/rice aromas and flavorist. Medium carbonation. My rating is based on the fact it's meant to be the least flavourful and lightest of beers.,3.25

Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a murky tomato juice color with almost no head of foam.
Smell – As would be expected the nose is heavy of a tomato juice and clamato smell. Mixed with these aromas is a light graininess and a touch of mustiness.
Taste – The taste starts out with a quite sweet and salty clamato taste with a little bit of light breadiness. This pretty much sums up the majority of the taste throughout. Not good!
Mouthfeel – With the clamato, the brew is slightly thicker and chewier with a lower carbonation.
Overall – Nope. Not going back to this one. I sometimes like clamato in a light lager, but this is over the top in clamato. Way too much and way to sweet and salty. It’s a no go.",1.75

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy reddish/pinkish color with about an inch pink cola-like head that fizzled away pretty quick. Not much if any lacing at all. The brew smells like tomato juice, clamato, salt and a bit of lime. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some mineral and peppery flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating, smooth and enjoyable to drink. Truthfully, the longer I drink it the more I like it. I don't know if it's because of the clamato, but this is a big improvement over the Modelo Chelada I had earlier today. I'd definitely buy this one again.",3.5

Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,"Picked up from a drive-thru liquor store as a tall boy for $2.99. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Thick, near-syrupy bright scarlet with a sort of opaqueness to it. 1mm pale rust head that disappears nearly instantly.
S - V8, clams, and gasoline. Mineral, almost like salt. Slight rice backing.
T - Heavy ethanol and lime notes lead way to even heavier clam and V8 flavors. Though barely noticeable, rice and wheat are present. Black pepper finish.
F - Viscous and barely carbonated.
O - Before I could make out any flavor, the first thing that came to my head was ""what the fuck did I just drink?"" For the sake of being 100% fair with everything I drink (and in recognition that this is likely an acquired taste), I drank the whole thing - about two and a half glass pours. First off, it's bad. Getting that out of the way, it's not as bad as you'd first think! It tastes like clamato and lime. Like a really terrible bloody mary. I should note that bloody mary cocktails aren't really my thing, but I get the appeal. This beer would definitely be better if it had some heat to it, and a lot more black pepper. Maybe some celery. I won't buy this again, but it's worth giving it a try.",1.0
Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,A lot of people are not judging this michelada fairly. This is a great michelada that is a higher abv than most other micheladas on the market.

Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,"To be frank, the beer looks bad. Its a fizzy, milky reddish orange. It doesn't look appealing. The smell is that of Clamato more than beer. Once again, not appealing. The taste however is very reminiscent of a bloody mary. It is tangy with the herbalness of the tomato coming through with a hint umami. Not bad, but not really beery either. The feel is interesting. It is quite bubbly. It is thick, but not in a beer way. It coats your mouth and is hard. Overall, not sure what to think of this. Its interesting to be sure. If I'm in the mood for this kind of flavor, I'll go for a bloody mary.",2.25

Taste...imagine pouring a flat beer into an expired can of tomato juice and adding a pinch of juice from a rotten lime. Why anyone would drink this stuff when they don’t have to is a mystery. Mouthfeel is thin, as expected, and the aftertaste reminds me of the watered down bloody Mary’s I used to get at Little Rock airport. Except those used to get me drunk.

Bud Light & Clamato Chelada,"25 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 8/24/2019. Pours moderately murky/cloudy reddish orange/amber color with a fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Mild herbal bitterness and peppery spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/creamy tomato mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Mildly increasing lingering pepper heat through the glass; pleasant and not overwhelming. Overall this is a delicious fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/spicy finish. Far exceeded all expectations, definitely one of the best I've had in this category. Most other cheladas I've had were too heavy on tomato juice/body. This is perfect balance of Bud Light and Clamato flavors; with nice malt presence for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example.",3.5
Keystone Premium,"I have drank many different beers over the years. Iron City and Lite, Rolling Rock, Bud and Bud Light, Coors Light, Yuengling... and Keystone Premium is by far my favorite. A very nice balance of taste. Not heavy and bitter but not too light and sweet either. I pray that they never stop making it!",5.0
Keystone Premium,Ice cold on a hot day and it was still disgusting. My neighbor handed me one out of his cooler while I was doing yard work. The taste is metallic and skunky. There are notes of corn and grains for something positive. Smell is very similar to the taste only less intense on the metallic aspect. Mouth feel is pretty much the same as water. Probably the worst beer I have ever tasted.,1.5

Keystone Premium,"Well here comes more of that urine and garbage liquid yellow blended with water. Doesn't for a head. A mixture of metal, corn, futuristic aluminum space ship alloys and molecular aromas your primitive nose wouldn't understand.

Notice I didn't talk about hops or yeast? Yeah, not sure they're here. Somehow this is worse than Keith Stone Light.",1.5

Keystone Premium,"Keystone Premium brewed by Coors Brewing Company, with an ABV of 4.40% Also known as Keystone RED. This brew pours out a nice light amber color with a smell white head. The smell is nice with some grains and hops at the end. This brew has look and smell of most American Adjunct Lagers on the market. The taste is ok you pick up on the grains. the mouthfeel is smooth with no bad after taste. Keystone is a little light for being premium. Overall I'm giving Keystone Premium a 4 out 5. This is a nice drinking brew I would get this brew again.",4.0
Corona Light,"I've been waiting my whole life for this. It's the first time I've ever gotten a Corona Light when I asked for it. I've never even seen it at grocery stores. Although, to be fair, I've only looked once or twice--but god damn, this was at huge box stores with massive macro selections. To be perfectly honest, I was damn near certain this was a hoax that didn't actually exist. So it was to my utter surprise that our local dirt cheap Mexican restaurant not only listed it on their menu, but actually delivered it to the table as ordered. Thus was my ultimate bucket list whale slayed.

The overall experience is, as expected, light, ricey skunk. However, it was also surprisingly toasty. I typically find the lighter versions of macro lagers to be the lesser of its representations, but since I have only ever had ""regular"" Corona Extra up until now, I'm finding myself flummoxed that I'm not entirely sure that Light is the worse of the two. Bottle to bottle, I'd probably take this over Extra. Even the lightly fluffy medium body isn't impacted too terribly by the ""lightening.""

To wrap this up, the appearance within a lime wedged bottle--which itself I find slightly less attractive than Extra--is otherwise lightly chill-hazed piss yellow with, after a tilt, a relatively active but rapidly receding carbonation.

Don't worry, I removed the lime wedge and serviced the tip liberally prior to this exhaustive review.

Enjoy.",2.75

I spent twenty years drinking mostly Corona-Bud Light-Miller Lite, so the smell and flavor of this beer are very familiar. The game changer is canning. This is the first non-skunked Corona I can remember. So to start, the worst flaw is gone.
Clear gold with one finger fine white head. Spotty lacing, partial surface ring.
Corn, light floral, pale malt bready odors.

Corona Light,"400th review/rating, friends advised me to have a terrible beer for kicks, here we are.

look: retained a one finger white head for longer than anticipated but quickly enough dissipated to a thin layer of bubbles, beer is a brownish gold colour with rushing manic carbonation in beer, clear of course.

smell: bad, skunked to bits, smell the skunk a decent distance from the glass to its pungent, very metallic, grainy, sweet, syrupy sweet, lime, some biscuity malt, icky.

taste: man that is poor, i really forgot what it was like to have properly bad beer, it is nasty there’s no avoiding it, not even snobbishness at this point, skunky, sweet as hell, like a malt soda, grainy, metallic, a hint of lime, no lingering flavours at all except some residual sweetness, poor.

feel: light bodied, medium carbonation, super watery, all the depth of flavour of a can of diet coke, thin nothingness.

overall: this drinks like a bad non alcoholic beer and for me has altered the benchmark on what i will judge bad beer on, worst beer i’ve ever had, if you like this beer, all power to you, but i implore you to try, like, anything else that is beer, probably better.",1.5

Taste follows the smell, not a whole lot there though since it's a light beer. This beer is pretty high in carbonation, thin, but goes down exceptionally well. Let's be honest here, this is one of the best LIGHT beers you can get, so don't judge this beer off of the best pilsner you have had; judge it for what it is. Garnish this beer with a lime & go get in the pool or mow your lawn & you wont be disappointed.",3.0

Far from undrinkable though.",2.25
Carlton Cold,"I recently reviewed Victoria Bitter which I drank for old time's sake by chance and it reminded me of one of the other beers I drank whilst in Australia; Carlton Cold.

I wanted to review this beer because unlike VB which I liked at the time but recently gave a very poor review, this beer I disliked even at the time so I wanted to see if it really is as bad as I remember.

My friend recently went to Australia so I asked him ton grab me a bottle so I could review it.

Poured most of a 355ml bottle into a 350ml beer glass.

Poured a pale watery yellow with a very loose, low head that disappeared almost immediately. No lacing.

Nose was extremely disappointing. A faint hoppy aroma, some other faint but unidentifiable aromas. maybe chemical. Horrible.

Palate. Much the same as the nose; faintly hoppy and watery. No complexity or malt. Horrible. Probably worse than the nose.

Mouth was watery with very loose medium to heavy artificial carbonation. Horrible.

Overall, probably even worse than I remember. An almost unbelievably woeful attempt at brewing beer. Breweries that churn out abominations like this shouldn't be allowed to call it lager or beer. It should perhaps be called ""Carlton Cold - Adjunct Grain Derivative""

Absolutely horrible. Highly unrecommended.",1.0
Carlton Cold,"Carlton Cold is filtered below zero degrees celsius, creating a full flavoured fresh taste. The mid strength beer has subtle bitterness with a crisp dry finish, providing an easy drinking experience.",3.0
Carlton Cold,"Format: a standard clear 355mL bottle with that old Carlton Cold macro label. I get the feeling that CUB has dropped Cold from being a full strength to a mid at 3.5% (as this bottle is) when they started their big advertising campaign a year or so ago. I used to drink Cold at barbeques because I was a poor student. Let's revisit it at 3.5% and see if it is any good.

Appearance: poured out a light yellow in colour with a continual swirling cascade of carbonation. Even with a fairly generous pour, very little head pops up - just a light white cap and ring.

Aroma: this has a smell? I got so close to try and smell it that I accidentally snorted some, which was both embarrassing and a bit of a mistake. Once it was clinging to my nose (and possibly my brain), I got wet cardboard and some cheap grains. Great.

Taste: a pretty damn awful cheap grain and corn adjunct dominates what little flavour this thing has. One of the rare few beers that actually makes me pull a weird face.

Aftertaste: drops away quickly with just a touch of sweetness coming through from the grain.

Mouth feel: light and watery in body with a mouth-filling carbonation. Not great.

Overall: for the sake of my many barbeque memories, I will assume that the Carton Cold that I used to drink 10 years ago (the full strength 4.9%) was less bad than this 3.5% that you get now. This beer manages somehow to be both boring, and taste bad. Most of it was donated to the Gods of the sink. It's only AU$40 a case, but seriously, just drink water or something. It certainly tastes better.",1.75
Carlton Cold,"Just a typical Aussie macro lager. Whilst the taste is not offensive and thankfully lacks the coin flavour that many others feature, it is just so plain and unimaginative that I couldn't commend it in any way other that to say it does not make me recoil.

Carlton Cold,"Honestly and without hesitation I can say that I used to love this beer.
When it was considered a heavy, in the older style bottle and before the $5m relaunch.
It had the crisp yet satisfying appeal but now that Carlton have sucked the the living essence out the first beer I ever tried I will never be buying it again.

All I can say is good job to the dickhead who thought that that was a good idea.",1.0
Carlton Cold,this beers is crap when i open there is minimal fizz from the low carbonation in the beer its self. the aroma that comes out when first opened is putrid my fat chicks girlfriends shit smells and tastes and better than this and trust me i would know. give me a VB any day that shit is fucking holy water even better taken as a suppository.,1.5
Carlton Cold,"This is the second of three Australian beers my store has brought in, and is surprisingly the most expensive one despite... on here anyway, looking like the worst. I had to go for it though. My store, to make any sort of decent margin, sells this catastrophe for 4 Canadian dollars per small 330ml bottle, making it by far the biggest rip off in the entire store. Nobody even gave it a chance as a $21 6-pack. I digress though.

The beer honestly looks pretty nice - it as a slightly darker shade of yellow than most adjunct lagers and has a copper-y colour to it that makes it resemble almost exactly the bottle of maple whiskey that is sitting on my table. Not bad on that front.

The smell is also not bad. It's got the standard adjunct smell, but it has some kind of deep, fruity smell that makes smelling it almost interesting and is not offensive, especially considering the beer vatriety. Smells good; looks good; what could go wrong?

Well, after the first sip, I very well knew what went wrong. The taste of this beer is just bad, bad, bad. It's a corny burst on the tongue with an explosion (no joke, it felt that way) of sour aftertaste. Going down the beer felt like straw... it was ROUGH, a term I don't even use much for heavy beers, but that is what was going on. 1's for taste and feel for sure - I can't even finish more than 5cm of the glass, it is just that putrid.

Carlton Cold,"Sometimes I wonder why I even bother with this crap. Oh well, I payed a dollar fifty for this so I could satisfy my ""curiosity"" to find out whether this beer is as bad as I remember it.

A- For some reason, I poured this into my pilsner glass. Hell, I bet most drinkers of this wouldn't pour it at all. Looks like piss with dissolved chemicals on top that attempt to form a thin layer of head which dissolves instantaneously.

S- This smells like the result of blending a small amount of soap and a HUGE amount of water together. Unless my imagination is playing tricks on me, I can also detect a faint, bizarre metallic twinge which worries me a little. I do wonder EXACTLY what goes into this mass-produced bile.

T- Oh. My. GOD!! This actually tastes feral. The taste reminds me of water that has been left in a plastic bottle for a year- where the plastic has started to seep into the water. Hideously offensive, this is a true assault on the palate. Battery acid would be more appealing. What saddens me, is that there is no beer flavour of any kind at all. I tend to think that the label of ""filtered"" is refering to the ingredients themselves- that they have all been entirely 'filtered' out.

M- Insultingly watery and horrendously flat. I could have spent my dollar fifty on a bottle of water instead, hey, it would have tasted and felt the same. So disgusting that any chance this had of being somewhat refreshing is completely negated.

O- I utterly don't believe that people can label this atrocity 'beer' while keeping straight faces. This is to beer what Justin Bieber is to music: fake, mass-produced, weak and a disgrace. Yet despite all this trash talk about this *splutter* beer, I actually had a positive experience drinking this- it reminded me of precisely why I switched to craft beer in the first place. The people at CUB need to be jailed for fraud- or even better, shot on sight.",1.0
Carlton Cold,"Pours a pale, clear gold colour. Not a lot of fizz crawling up to a fluffy white head that consists of visible bubbles, sinking slowly and leaving a frankly unappealing trail of lace behind that looks more like soap sud residue than traces of residual malt. Pretty bland, unimpressed.

The smell combines all the bouquet of a chemical weapons plant with the organic undertones of a mass grave for holocaust victims. Seriously though, it's the bitter alkali aroma of chemically-induced beer flavouring with weak yet syrupy undertones of sucrose. Objectively speaking, it's appalling.

Taste is actually a bit of a nostalgic journey for me. While it wasn't Carlton Cold, it was Hahn Ice that gave me my first ever taste of beer when I was about eight years old. And, like that first encounter, this beer also makes me want to rush, gagging, for the bathroom before I'm sick all over my mother's linoleum floor. Front palate is virtually non-existent with maybe some light granules of insta-malt dissolved in water. Bitterness kicks in midway, all metallic and alkaline with that battery acid component and just the taste of the inside of Carlton's ""big metal things"" that they use to manufacture (not brew) this horrific liquid waste. It's not even worth noting any more, because it's so far gone that it's beyond the boundaries of meaningful human reproach.

There's a bit more body than I expected. Not a lot of fizz and leaves without a trace. Yep, mission accomplished, it's an empty beer, suitable for downing by the six-pack before your shotgun wedding to your own pregnant cousin.

If, as Benjamin Franklin is reported to have said, beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy, then surely Carlton Cold is God's way of testing our faith. Unlike Job, I will not simply 'endure' this tribulation but rather take advantage of another of God's useful inventions, the sinkhole, and return this manifestation of His bounty to the bowels from whence he excreted it.",1.0

The beer may have some application of a 45 degree day, however I can think of at least 50 beers in the same price bracket that I would slam down ahead of this.",1.5

Carlton Cold,"From a clear glass bottle (how do they expect that to help, especially in sunny Oz?), this beer pours a clear, very pale golden, like once, twice, three times diluted apple juice. It has a whole whack of puffy, airy, white head, that leaves some lacing around the glass.

It smells of very faint white grain, and, well, hard water. The taste is mildly sweet white grain - rice husk and mealy corn, and skank. Don't know if it's from the grain or any hops that might have made it into this waste of time, but I also don't care. It gets a decent score on the skank scale, actually, and that's because I have a recent Coors Light experience from which to make comparisons, and frankly, the Coldness of Colorado beats out the Coldness of C.U.B., hands down in this case.

The carbonation is moderate, the body pretty thin, and it finishes off-dry, with more of that adjunct sweetness lingering like a bad cold...wait, no, ok, pun intended...

Coors Light,"Poured from a 12oz can best by September 12th 2022 into a pils glass

On the pour I was pleasantly surprised by a nearly 4 finger head from a slightly hard pour. The dissipation is still fast enough that it goes down to a covering over top in a minute, but still I expected worse. Very very lively carbonation with a very pale straw body, barely darker than a champagne.

Aroma is bad. Watered down, and what is there is all awful terribly treated yeast. Has an old sweaty character to it with a certain metallic quality as well. No malts are detectable on the nose over all the offness. Straight failure barely has a beer smell it's just bad. Not disgusting like shit, but it's bad. I can see why it's called piss water.

Taste is thankfully not like the smell some malts are actually present, just a vague crackery malt with zero bitterness to balance. The malts come at the very end however and the rest of the beer gives a beer flavored seltzer vibe. Very watery even in flavor.

Feel is of carbonated water with much more carbonation bite than necessary. Slightly more body than actual soda water with some head forming on your sip but it's hard to get past the carbonation bite. Super easy to put down from the can though, for the same reason white claws are easy to put down, your body assumes it's just bubbles and water.

Overall you'd probably be better off drinking keystone light or even bud light. I prefer Banquet over Budweiser, but coors light is some authentic piss water.",2.0

Tastes of hay, well water and a bubbly, mineralic carbonation, inviting a well working malt backbone to the palate. Has a subtle, yet sugary mid palate with nothing else to offer and finishes with a sprizzy, yet watery ending.

This manages to be light and refreshing, while unfolding a one dimensional flavor profile at the same time, making this perfect for when its effect is more important than the beer‘s actual taste.",2.75

O'Doul's,"Poured from an undated 12oz can into a smaller Antique Coors Glass

On the pour 1 finger of perfectly average head formed then recedes pretty quickly to a decent cap. The body is your typical AAL color with fine medium carbonation.

Aroma is like sex in a canoe.... after eating a single peanut, I can't pick up much of anything at all. At least it's clean I guess. Some slight corn way off in the distance.

Taste is stronger than the aroma but not by much. Super light but at the same time it is super clean as well. Some corny ""malt"" off in the background again but slightly stronger. Tastes like corn flakes steeped in carbonated water.

Feel is bigger than the taste and aroma suggest with the actual feel of beer as opposed to Budweiser Zero which feels like beer flavored soda. Medium short finish with a mouthcoating feel. Carbonation mixed with the decent head is a big driving force here.

Overall I wish Anhueser Busch would get it together and make a beer with the feel of this and the taste of budweiser zero, or at least make this have more flavor. If the taste was stronger it would remind me a lot of Tivoli Outlaw Lager.",3.0

Taste - The essence of beer. Like the smell, it's exactly what comes to mind when you think AAL. Very mild and balanced, sweet but not overly sweet, just enough earthiness without tasting dirty. Don't think I'd ever turn down a can if I was offered one.

The taste is crisp, carbonated, without a terrible aftertaste; although it does taste a little chemically/processed at the end of the draw. All in all, although it may get labeled as kind of lame for being ‘low carb’, I thinks it a fine beer in its category.

Sleeman Clear,A watered-down version of Sleeman original,1.75
Sleeman Clear,"473 mL can from TBS; packaged June 14 2013. Now labelled as 'Sleeman Clear 2.0', although as far as I can tell nothing about the recipe seems to have changed from the earlier iteration. When considering all of the (formerly) Canadian macros, I generally place Sleeman a notch above the other two - but Sleeman Clear is a turd that has been floating in the punchbowl for at least 10 years now, and I can only assume that there is a very good reason for its score being so low. Served ice cold.

An aggressive pour reveals a pale straw yellow-coloured liquid, topped with one finger of fizzy white head that wastes no time while fizzling itself out of existence. Nothing remains on the surface; it basically looks like apple juice. The aroma is bland, but it manages to avoid outright unpleasantness by being so weak and limp that it's barely even noticeable in the first place. A faint wisp of corn husks, damp grains and apples are the only real descriptors I can manage. For a light lager, it's not that bad, I guess, but it leaves much to be desired.

Not much to report in the taste department either - not very grainy, but corn grist is a strong contributor, and that cardboard flavour I often find in cheap/light/ice beers is fairly noticeable. Dry finish that really reminds me of club soda, in that it has no discernible features whatsoever beyond being carbonated. Thin and very watery, with firm carbonation that provides this beer with a solid bite. It's easy enough to drink quickly, and I can't think of any compelling reasons to take your time with it.

Final Grade: 2.3, a to-be-avoided D grade. Sleeman may find that it will take more than a '2.0' slapped onto the label to convince those that were less-than-impressed with the 'alpha' version of Sleeman Clear that this purported upgrade is worth a try. Let's be frank - this is a brew that I have seen (exclusive) light beer drinkers turn their nose up at on several occasions. This is not a very good light beer, being even more watery and flavourless than old staples like Bud/Coors Light. If you hate the taste of beer but still want to drink it for some reason, Sleeman Clear is your brew; otherwise, stick with one of the more well known light macros. Hell, Sleeman Light is orders of magnitude better than this.",2.0
Sleeman Clear,"Yes, it is a pretty awful and flavourless ""beer""... but what really can you expect for under 100 calories. It tastes like water but honestly I still think it tastes better than coors, canadian or bud light because at least it doesn't taste like skunk water",2.0
Sleeman Clear,"Revisited this beer a couple nights ago, as I was offered and wanted to see if it was as bad as I thought it was. Labelled as Sleeman clear 2.0, not sure if the recipe changed, but I couldn't tell much of a difference.

Smell - A faint grainy aroma is all I can pick up. Nothing strange but not much of anything. AAL's smell extremely aromatic compared to this.

Taste - There's nothing off here, but there's just well nothing here at all. Tastes light water, with a slight lagery additive.

Budweiser Select,"BOTTLE:

I'm finding this surprisingly flavorful for a light lager of 99kcal, and surprisingly flavorful even compared to regular Budweiser. The caramel malt actually comes through in its taste, giving it a more diverse malt backbone than comparable light lagers with a bit more sweetness and body. Refreshing and nicely balanced, with a glimmer of floral hop flavour working its way in in addition to the usual grassiness.

Not watery or syrupy, nor is it redolent of any off-flavours (or overt adjunct). You can't say that about many value beers, let alone light lagers (so many are shallow simple watery garbage).

I don't see how one couldn't rate this at least above average in terms of the style; it's got more complexity and better balance than most I've tried. In terms of sheer flavor to kCal ratio, it's pretty strong (though Guinness probably wins out). I can imagine it better, but all in all it's rather well executed for what it is. I imagine many raters are just knocking it for being an AB-InBev product; I quite like it and definitely want another in this sitting.

Busch Beer,"Poured from an undated 12oz can

On the pour a big 3+ finger head forms in my pint glass that actually looks pretty nice but it quickly fades down allowing me to fit the whole can no problem. Over a couple minutes the head fades to a ring around the glass and some light carbonation floating on tip. Body is very carbonated and a golden yellow. On the first sip it tries to form lacing but it quickly sags to become just some clusters of bubbles stuck to the glass.

Aroma is basically all tart cheap unpleasant poorly treated lager yeast. There's maybe a slight hint of hops, maybe and a very light hint of corny maltiness on the back.

Flavor largely follows the aroma woth the tartness sticking around and essentially no bitterness the finish is a vaguely sweet corny light malt. Pretty simple and not great.

Feel is decent and honestly has a bit of body to it. Despite the lightness in other categories this is a bit surprising, however it is VERY strongly carbonated almost to a ridiculous degree, which honestly combined with other aspects of the feel lend to fast drinking and surprising refreshing vibe to it despite the lower quality.

Overall this beer is what it is. Super easy to drink and not much else. Yeah it has some malt character but it's largely covered by flaws and the only redeeming feature of it is just how much of a lawnmower/frat beer this is.",2.5
Busch Beer,"Pretty shocked I've never reviewed this!

Look: Classic pale golden color, obvious carbonation with the thin, white foam cap.

Feel & Flavor: Certainly crisp, very light and pretty jazzy. Cream 'i corn sweetness with very lightly malted field grains, more sweetness with a tangy edge and green, herbal, maybe even spice blend, like from Grandma's kitchen.

I also prefer cans for this because you can break the tab off, use a lime to wipe all over the top and then salt it. It's the only way I can enjoy these types of beers but when money is tight I usually get Miller Highlife or Lone Star. I had to buy Busch today because I couldn't find a store carrying the ones I wanted. Now I will discuss the attributes without the addition of lime and salt.

Looks: If you hadn't poured it yourself you'd think it was a glass of ice cold piss.
Smell: Smells like ass with a hint of corn. Maybe peanut
Taste: Tastes like whoever brewed it had no concern to mask the alcohol which has a small amount of methanol along side the ethanol.
Feel: The mouth feel is not something that is worth rating. You wanna swallow as fast as you can. Do not swish.
Overall: Overall this beer is tolerable but far from gourmet. A commercial beer will always have low ratings.",4.0
Icehouse,"Poured from a 24oz can best by Nov 7th 2022

On the pour an impressive mostly fine woth some fizz 4 finger head forms then has enough retention to only lose a finger a minute. The head does become more fizzy and rocky however, amd carbonation is very high in the light golden body.

Aroma is pretty meh. Cheap lager tartness on a relatively decent corn and malt base but the cheap ick is there. Not the cleanest. Slight Metallic note.

Taste is actually nice for an ice beer. It's sortof like light Colt 45 or something but with a bit of that cheap ick. Malty corny and surprisingly light. There wants to be bitterness but it fades fast and I'm not sure if it's alcohol or hops.

Feel is light but mouthcoating. Quite drinkable and refreshing. This beer is one of the most chuggable Ice Beers I've had. Short finish on the ""main"" flavors but a light mouthcoating sweet corn adjunct sticks around for a while.

Overall I was expecting worse. For an ice beer its not bad, but still colt 45 is better if you want cheap above 5%, but MHL is still the king.",2.75

Icehouse,"Someday when we're old men sitting in our floating rocking chairs on our space porches watching the starships roll by, we'll dream of the amazingly cheap ice beers we used to buy in our youth to get us drunk on a lazy day, because the only thing left to buy will be overpriced mars pale ales. But today is not that day.
Look man it's an ice beer. It's meant to be cheap, strong, and less filling. And they say this was the first. Same as everything else in this style: strong malt, slight sweet corn, light feeling, only a tad skunky if you drink slow and let it warm. You know what you bought this for, if you wanna be critical about it piss off back to the ipa factory you vape at next to the burned out train station. Among ice beers? I put it in second behind busche and just before bud because it's ever so slightly darker. It's fun to change it up, so if the race is at Daytona this week spring for a case",2.25

I rather buy them something else than ruing my reputation of being the beer aficionado of the clique. I would say this beer is good on a hot day where there is nothing else to drink and you are not trying to drink many of them and are barbecuing or it is a dog day of summer. This is a pour out beer.

L: polished-clear, pale, yellow liquid; unsurprising tight, white, lasting foam - yes!... lace spiraling down glass; constant collar

S: masa, play-doh, dry cereal grass, lipstick... intensity below-mellow, well under the threshold of off-putting obviosity

T: lightly-peppery (carbonic acid?) tortilla-tinged pils malt; extra dry, peppery aftertaste, with a delicate malt flavor lingering... about 1/4 through, and a subtle lemon or lime note has emerged in the aftertaste; mildly phenol perhaps as well

F: soft roll to its flow up front, almost inflating the palate, but quickly fade-dropping away, with a tailing carbonic prickle (not too much or too little - just enough)... perfect kiss of roundness up front, with an ideal drop and sparkle finishing it out

O: I finally found you! - and you're not half bad!... despite it having my beloved Miller-masa spicing, this is more or less typical of its packaging/branding, though its slightly drier cut and more pronounced peppery edge does make it stand out a bit...

Update

I’m on my 10th 12 pack now. It’s nice to throw in in heavy rotation with craft beers. I’d say A good ratio is like 36 icehouse to 1 6 pack of craft beer.

Hurricane Malt Liquor,"The head fizzled away fairly quickly, but there are still a large amount of bubbles forming an rising to the top to quickly have their gas escape into the world.

The nose is a mix of malt and weak brown sugar sweetness and metallic medicinal notes that are filling in for hop bitterness in an unsuccessful attempt. It's actually somewhat off-putting.

Luckily, the taste avoids the aroma's pitfall. It's actually not that bad. It has a little bit of toast mixed in with the sweetness that it brings. And it's not overly sweet by any means. There's a generic bitterness that I might argue is slightly woody (maybe it had some contact with some beechwood chips). There's a slight unripe banana note in the aftertaste.

The nose hurts this a lot, and warmth isn't its friend. But there were some parts that weren't so bad. Drinking fairly cold was better.",2.0

L: crystal-clear, brassy-colored liquid, topped with loose, bouncy, off-white suds, which collapse in 2 min... actually several boogers of lace, gets chunkier with longer rings with each pour, also keeps a collar

S: dried grass, dried flowers, musty burlap/cardboard, soft hint of skunk; underlying hang of cereal-like graininess (Kix-forward), faint metallic overtone, dull presence of alcohol

T: dominant note front and center of a mildly-sweet hard candy with a dull citrus and/or butterscotch flavor - haven't tasted quite this shade of malt syrup-osity in any other malt liquor... kind of a champagne soda aftertaste, with a very delicate spicy phenol lingering, as well as a faint nutty husk note

F: with first pour, very little carbonation to excite the palate; even with subsequent pours kicking up a tall head, it doesn't translate to anything remotely prickly on the tongue... the body starts with a mild oily grip, but immediately thins out, leaving no impression of dimension... rather delicate warmth stirs after each sip

O: skunk not as bad as others... goes down pretty easy, and it grew on me, but I'd recommend drinking it colder to avoid the odd hard candy element - it's not that bizarre of a flavor for something like this, seemed to trail off, but lacks a secondary flavor to 'balance' it... at any rate, surprised at its relative quality - didn't intend to, but drank almost the whole bottle",3.5

Hurricane Malt Liquor,"(As ""Hurricane"" with ""Category 5"" on the label but the ABV listed at the top of the label as being 6% ABV - not 8.1% or 5.8% or 5.9% ABV as I've seen on other Hurricane branded beers).

""Malt liquor."" 6% ABV. 138 kCal per 12oz / 577.39 kJ per 12 oz. 0.00 fat per 12 oz. 4.20 carbohydrates per 12 oz. .90 protein per 12 oz.

Ingredients: Water; Corn, Rice and/or Dextrose Syrup; Barley Malt; Hop Extract; Yeast.

Glass bottle in the classic 40oz format purchased at a 7-11 in Manhattan for $3.31 including tax and deposit. Clear glass. Branded black screw-off cap.

Pours a clear pale copper body - obviously filtered - below an off-white cap of mediocre consistency and above average retention (~5-7 minutes).

Aroma hints at graininess in addition to decently disguised corn adjunct, cheap 6-row barley, and pale malt. Inoffensive. Doesn't suggest a syrupy or watery beer, but I'm reading it as on the thicker side based on this aroma. Hop profile isn't completely absent; I think I get some mild grassiness. Suggests an innocuous malt liquor with no egregious flaws but plenty of shortcomings in terms of complexity, depth of flavour, subtlety, balance, and build. Aromatic intensity is below average. Doesn't seem boozy and I detect no off-notes.

Taste is indeed innocuous and inoffensive, which is high praise for a malt liquor. Sure, there's a bit too much 6 row and pale malt sweetness as well as corn adjunct, and it's a bit too thick, but it isn't syrupy or watery and it isn't cloyingly sweet or overly adjunct-emphatic. I've certainly had worse, and there's a slight scintilla of grassy hop flavour to its credit.

Certainly not dialed-in, but it's not imbalanced. Shallow and simple, but approachable and pleasant enough for a 6% ABV malt liquor offered in the 40 oz format. Let's be fair - there's far worse out there. This may be a bit insipid, but that isn't always a bad thing in the budget beer category.

Texture is slightly overcarbonated and crisp. Unrefreshing owing to its slightly syrupy feel and overly thick presence on the palate. Has too much weight on the palate for a beer as insipid as this. Not oily, gushed, tannic, astringent, rough, hot, boozy, or scratchy. This mouthfeel doesn't elevate the beer as a whole or accentuate specific flavours, but it also doesn't clash with the taste.

Overall, it's mediocre at best, but it's one of the better (least bad?) attempts at the style I've tried recently. $2.99 USD plus tax and deposit is as fair a price as you'll find in Manhattan for such an inoffensive brew, and this is probably up there with Ballantine XXX in terms of my go-to budget 40oz format brews. Many will shit on this because it happens to be brewed by Anheuser-Busch, but in a blind taste test I'm confident it'd outperform most competing brands. Judging it strictly to style, it's actually pretty decent fare and I won't mind taking down the entire 40oz bottle.

On the pour a decent 1.5 finger white head formed. The head has decent retention but it's a pretty fast dissipation to a thinner cap. The body is a solid gold with lots of fine carbonation.

Aroma us a bit rough. Some off apple juice and a bit of a funky lager. A bit malty other than that but meh.

Taste has a bit of off flavor. There is a nice malty sweetness right off the bat and it's quite attenuated and stays pretty balance. There is a twinge of tartness, but for the style this is decent. Biscuity finish with a hint of corn.

Feel is drinkable and relatively crisp, but it's not the most chuggable beer with some odd esters here and there. Medium finish with a pretty neutral mouthfeel.

I was in Florida for the Daytona 500 and swung by the Anheuser Busch brewery in Jacksonville on the way to Daytona.

30 years later, I stumbled across the 25 oz cans in a local gas station (I never said it was highbrow) and decided to give one a shot. Upon arriving home, I cracked the can open and poured (most of) the beer into a 16 oz glass.
The color is light (for a malt) and the head is respectable due to the fairly high carbonation. The first sip brought back memories of the caramel-malt flavor I remembered from years ago. It was refreshing and was a good match for the 102-degree heat.

L: crystal-clear, slightly-pale gold colored liquid; little foam on the pour, only a thin collar remains... second pour yielded much more foam, but it deflates in seconds, though a few lil scars of lace circle the glass

S: no spray of skunk upon cap removal... light pilsner malt aroma with hint of cardboard... dried grass undertone, little alcohol present... certainly malty, but anemic intensity

T: one of the thinnest malt flavors/foundations I've come across in a malt liquor - little discernible sweetness, bitterness is relatively dull but has a mild peppery bite with could be in part carbonic acid, aftertaste is quite dry with perhaps minuscule notes of circus peanut and dried out candy caramel, but that's a stretch... the malt opens up a tad through subsequent sips, but the overall taste remains that of a 'premium'-grade Bud, underbelly as watery as some watery water

F: little body (take away the water and it's just air), little dimension, virtually no finish (if that's possible)... there's a light, refreshing kiss of soft carbonation with each sip... the engineering on this remarkable (or it's just water diluted with beer) - probably the second most watery beer I've ever had next to Natty Ice (oh wow! AB brews that too, surprise surprise)

O: impulse buy at a liquor store I'd never visited (along with a low-priced Johnnie Walker Green); pulled the bottle out from behind a couple others in a dimly-lit fridge, thinking the less exposure to light might bode better for any skunk present... one of the most neutral-tasting, boring-to-death, yet supremely-crushable malt liquors I've come across, which is its only compliment as it's not the least bit off-putting given that there's next to nothing going on...

Top end of sweetness and maltiness. The middle is tangy with a good amount of malt and finishes with a clean, crisp and dry swallow. The hop notes are grassy like all lagers however you don't pick up much. It's really all about balance. This beer is not sickening sweet and the adjucts are not noticeable. The feel is rather syrupy and not creamy. There is a decent amount of body. Nice crisp, clean and smooth. I really think this is a great cheap beer, don't hesitate to give it a try!",5.0

Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,"Color on the pour seems to be a hazy yellow with no head at all.
Smell is malty lime. Does that make sense? Like lots of lime with some really sweet white bread smells. Not bad but a bit odd.

Mouth feel is sticky tangy sour and sweet. A lot going on here, right. Lots of bubbles still popping in the back of the mouth and throat after the taste. Kind of fun. Like Pop Rocks.
Overall this is an over priced product. I love that this is a Bud light product! I do not like a lot of the Bud line up starting with the signature Bud let alone the crap Bud Light. Yet this seems to laugh in the face of the Bud Light. Artificial flavor, huge ABV and nowhere light in the mouth feel. I really have to rate this well for kind of kicking a lot of Bud norms to the curb. And I do apologize to regular Bud drinkers. Carry on and Cheers! Drink what makes you happy!

Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,"(25 oz can, 19089; 'contains alcohol'; purchased cold... poured into a 28 oz mug)

L: cloudy, jade(?)-yellow liquid; foam on pour, quickly collapses to nothing, persistent activity of bubbles rising

S: smells shooting out as soon as the tab was popped... smells exactly like a blend of margarita mix and 'malt beverage' - enticing, but hardly representative of my beloved malt liquor species

T: margarita mix: sweet, but not sickly so... the background/base is certainly malty, no doubt (and no doubt artificially enhanced with the added sugars), but its definition is obscured... rather flavorful; faint vinyl pool liner note in the back though... is that bitterness or booze struggling to break out?... a bit cloying, eh?

F: it's not all-out syrupy, but there's definitely a concentrate or two slick-sliding though its core... for 8%, the booze is buried rather well... not laborious to swill; fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence, but nonetheless a tad too weighty

O: I'd been avoiding it, but it was inevitable; a gap-filling review if there ever was one... alcopop all the way; interesting, but not all that bad for what it is (I'll never rid of my sweet tooth or my love of both 'malt beverage' and lime)... I may have said it before, but if slop like this is a 'malt liquor' (and the reasons this is on BA are probably understandable, if debatable), then y'all gotta add my old-school jawn, Smirnoff Ice in somewhere - 'fruit and field beer'??, wink wink (1467)",2.5

Bud Light Lime-A-Rita,"Poured from the tiny can, into a Budweiser pilsner glass. Here we go!

Pale dull muted dark straw colored body. Almost a sort of dark straw, and opaque. Fast amouts of cola fine carbonation through the body, bubbling up on the top like soda. Head creation is non existent, off white, soda popping and instant dissolve right out of the can and crackling noise. Not quite margarita looking, or daiquiri, and dull.

Aroma is not too bad for description. Decent lime like cordial aroma and lots of it. Slight very faint herbal and zest tone, but really does flirt with a big soapy character. There's even a touch of basic rock salt to this as well. Decent and basic, but real lime quality this is not.

Palate is quite sweet. Tastes like a basic machine made slushy type quality margarita. Large boozy character in the aftertaste, and strangely a big alcohol kick that just comes really out of nowhere. This is going straight to my head. Sticky simple syrup, and faint basic lime, with quite a bit of alcohol sweetness towards the end.

This comes off as a pour mans daiquiri, but also unfortunately has too much of a noticeable alcohol kick, that it would be hard to get through more than a few of these casually which is what it should be made for. Good concept, but not liking the execution.",3.0
Olde English 800,"Dark gold, amber looking color. Had 1 finger of white head on the pour and quickly lost half that. Looks like the half left is slowly dropping as I type. Lazy streaming carbonation visible.

Nose is a touch sweet. Grain smell on the nose comes through. Like corn grain.

The mouth is sweet and a bit of a malt like flavor. Seems simple on the taste, lets put the two together, now we have sweet malts. Is it overly sweet? No.

Mouth feel starts as a bit medium and finishes surprisingly well. A touch of lingering sweet malt and yes there is the grain on the back of the mouth that sits there for a minute.

I am in las Vegas, NV and was able to get the 7.5% ABV version and I did chill the crap out of the 24 oz. can before I cracked it. I think if this higher ABV (higher than the 5.9% ABV version) were to get warmed up it may have that malt liquor taste I find unpleasant. Kind of that, ""I am trying to be a lager, why the shit did they add this fructose syrup to spoil me?"", type of thing. If this were to warm up and had a sweeter taste were to come out I would say no way. I will say I have had much worse malt liquor beers for sure. Still searching for my final opinion. The one thing I do not like is I find myself trying to drink it before it warms. And today is a warm day, even though I am inside.. O.K. Maybe that is what this is for, fast slam hopefully quick buzz on a cheap beer, kind of a Four Loko ""beer"" thing. Enough rambling. How about will I buy it again? The higher ABV warming does come through a bit towards the end as I try to chase a chilled product. Buy it again is still a questionable thought. I really do not think I would try this again unless I could get the lower ABV. More along the lines of an Icehouse beer. Yet there may be a fit for this with some heavy meats on a good BBQ day. Damn now I am just hungry? This has been an exhausting push and pull beer review. I really look forward to more people trying the higher gravity and seeing what they think. I think at 5.9% and being cheap, again around the Icehouse region, this might work. I know people look for the ""higher gravity"" one, yet now I seek the ""lower gravity"" one"".

Olde English 800,"Pours a beautifully clear dark gold color with a fat finger of near white head that has solid retention and leaves solid lacing. Right away, I can tell the low marks for appearance in other BAs’ reviews reveal incredible biase.

The aroma is initially much crisper and more hop forward that I imagined. There’s some corn and even a little skunkiness beneath, but I’d probably peg this as a Euro Lager if tasting it blind. As it sits, the corn aroma becomes much thicker smelling, to the beer’s detriment, but marks for first impressions.

The taste is definitely not as impressive, but still nothing awful. There’s a bit of that Euro Lager-type bitterness, crispness and light skunk, but also an underlying nuttiness that I don’t particularly favor. Some moderate sweetness lingers in the aftertaste (including a decent kiss of apple juice); it’s bot overpowering at first, but grows over time.

The carbonation level in the mouthfeel is super dialed in — very zippy, but without being too heavy handed.

We’ll see how I feel after another 30 or 40 ounces, but a pint in, this is a reasonable enough beverage — and, given that a four-pack costs less than a single of most “craft” lagers available in 16-ounce cans, seems like an even better value.

Molson Canadian 67,"Molson 67 looks like a beer with less calories - less of everything for that matter. It is so markedly pale as to have virtually no colour at all on some angles. Despite lively bubbles it fails to support any kind of head. It looks anorexic; if it were your friend you'd be concerned for its health.

Molson can spend all the money in the world to advertise and market each of their brands differently, but so long as they keep using inferior ingredients they'll all smell the same. And not even the cleverest commercial or slogan ever conceived will make them smell good. This may have half the calories but it has every bit the foul stench.

Indeed, like most of this brewery's beers, there's little of anything tasteful or notably ""beer-like"" about it; bubbles and water are obvious but malt and hops are imperceptible. It's no surprise that this drinks like a combination of corn syrup and pool water; after all, it is loaded with industrial (possibly chemical) adjuncts and produced on a massive, highly mechanized scale.

Let's be clear though: the magnitude of a brewery's operations is not what affects quality; in fact, larger operations tend to be more consistent and have far better quality control. Molson, however, is not in the business of making good beer - they're in the business of selling a lot of beer. And when this is the priority it's no surprise the products taste like watered-down HFCS.

The only thing that makes Molson 67 halfway swallowable is that, true to theme, it has much less of that artificially sweet, off-putting, corn syrup-like flavour than standard strength lagers of equivalent nature. Some, however, will feel the diluted profile is a detriment. It didn't have to be that way; alcohol and flavour are not necessarily proportional. I've had plenty of delicious and characterful beers in the 3% range - this, however, is not one of them.

If you’re holding your breath waiting for Molson to make a good beer, be prepared to turn blue in the face and die. Unlike their chief rival, Labatt, who actually took the hint when their profits started diminishing and responded with the respectable Alexander Keith Hop Series, Molson seems content chasing one fad after another and spending all their resources on marketing rather than offering a half-decent product.",1.25
Molson Canadian 67,"473 mL can picked up at TBS; served well chilled. I had this a few years back - and by 'had', I mean an agent left a bunch of free samples behind at the liquor store I used to work at, which was around the time that this beer was initially being launched. As I chugged the contents of a single ice cold bottle just prior to clocking in for my shift, I was pretty sure it was the wateriest, most flavourless beer I'd ever had - and unsurprisingly, I haven't been inclined to return to it until now, when a lack of alternatives has left me scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Pours a clear, pale straw yellow colour, topped with one finger's worth of soapy bone-white head. Very active carbonation; streams of bubbles constantly rush to the surface, reinforcing the head for at least a few minutes before it finally recedes into a thin cap and collar. Lots of lacing, too - one of the better-looking light beers I've had in recent memory. It has that generic 'cheap yellow lager' aroma, with no real distinguishing traits to speak of... corn husk, a little grainy with some vaguely sweet features, and not much else. Typical of the style.

Weak, diluted flavour, but not quite as tasteless as some of the other 'low cal' lagers I've tried in the past. There's a light brushing of grainy malts and corn that vanishes from the palate almost as quickly as it appears. No real wheat malt presence (the label mentions both barley and wheat), and no real aftertaste - just some light malts, carbonation, and then it's gone. Thin-bodied and very watery, with heavy carbonation levels that give this brew a spritzy, lively feel in the mouth.

Final Grade: 2.6, a forgettable C-. A re-tasting of Molson Canadian 67 hasn't changed my opinion much - this is still an exceptionally watery, bland lager - but compared to certain other low-calorie light lagers (e.g. Sleeman Clear or Michelob Ultra), this one at least resembles an actual beer, so I can't grade it too harshly. These low-cal lagers aren't brewed for the average BA; they are brewed for calorie-counting women and people who don't like the taste of beer. Seen through the context of those goggles, this is at least a decent light lager, but there's no reason that anyone who falls outside of those categories really needs to bother with this.",2.5

The bad part is every thing else. This beer is gross in every way, with the taste and smell being the worst.
You can smell the actual alcohol mixed with a gross almost putrid stench.
The taste is overwhelmingly sour in the worst way possible. It's not ""sweet"" sour like with candy, it's BAD sour like something has spoiled. Absolutely bad.",2.5
Camo Black Ice,"Camo Black Ice brewed by Camo Brewing Company,with an ABV of 10.50% This malt liquor pours out of a 24oz can into a pint beer glass. The color is a deep golden amber color with a small white head. The head to this brew, goes away fast. There is is some real super thin lacing to this brew, it kinda sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is Strong with Malts an grains an lots of alcohol notes. This brew has the look an smell of most malt liquors on the market, not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is Bold with flavors. You pick up a lot of alcohol notes mixed with Malts and grains. The body of Camo Black Ice is heavy. This is alot smoother than the Camo Sliver style of this brew. Still a little rough around the edges. Nit my first choice , but if you need need a one an done kinda brew, this might fit the bill. The mouth feel is Bold, Alcohol, Malts, Clean, An Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Camo Black Ice a 2.5 out of 5. Camo Brewing Company, did a decent job with this Malt Liquor.",2.5

Camo Black Ice,"In terms of ABV, the equivalent of more than four typical AAL for $1.19 for a 24 ounce can. Given what you could reasonably expect given that, I don't see how someone could complain -- indeed, how someone couldn't find this better than anticipated.

Still -- well, it's Camo. Whadjya expect?",4.5
Camo Black Ice,"24 FL. OZ. can
Served in a pokal glass

This beer pours a beautiful straw color and is topped with a mountain of effervescent, white head that leaves some really nice spider web lacing.

The smell takes me back to when I was a child and my dad, who raised sheep, went to the local feed mill and had grain milled for the lambs. That smell is reminiscent in this wonderful elixir. I also get wisps of floral hops along with a healthy dose of alcohol.

The first few gulps make me winch due to the booziness. Once I get used to it I begin to pick out sweet grain notes along with some stiff alcohol.

It is quite thin which is typical for this underrated and undervalued style of beer.

This beer is not for the faint of heart. It is made to deliver a lot of bang for the buck, and believe me it does. Being a connoisseur of some of the finest malt liquors in the United States, I find this beer amazing. I love the strong taste. I love the fact that it is 10.5% abv. I love the fact that it is $1.79 for a 24oz can. I just wish I could find it locally. I had to buy it on a recent trip to Detroit and tote it home to enjoy after falling in love with it at my hotel room at 1:20am with a bag of White Castles. Craft brewers need to explore this style more or exclusively.",4.25
Camo Black Ice,"In my 3 years of legal drinking i have drank at least 200 brands/types of beers. This is the worst ive had. Taste is a mixture of nail polish remover and apple juice. Smell is of a typical high gravity but stronger. Poured about 1 ounce of this beer into a shotglass to observe its pale yellow color with a high white head that disappeared quickly. Drank the other 23 ounces from the can because honestly nobody that typically drinks this beer would pour it into a glass. This beer has one purpose in life and that is to get people drunk at 10.5% alcohol. However even rating it in that sense it is a terrible beer. Steel reserve, Hurricane and side pocket are all similar in alcohol content and price and they all have a much more tolerable to even slightly enjoyable taste. So realistically im not sure why Camo Black Ice even has a place on the beer store shelf.",1.5
Camo Black Ice,"Clear gold with one finger of short lived head. Some lacings.
Smell is typical M.L. not too bad for the style.
Taste is malty some brewers syrup hops are hard to find. No bad flavors and alcohol is well hidden.
Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Finish is mostly sweet and not too dry.
Overall a tasty M.L. for such a high abv. Would I buy it again? Maybe but just one 24 ounce can.",3.5
Camo Black Ice,"I've tasted a lot of beers in my time, but this has to be among the worst. I know some people mentioning a head, but it had very little for me. The smell was okay, but the taste was like pure alcohol with a hint of apple to it. If there were any hops in it, they must have floated to the top and been scraped off because I could taste none. The ONLY reason I gave it more than a 1.0 is because you could easily hold your breath and guzzle the stuff down---little carbonation or aftertaste. Skip it!",2014.0
Camo Black Ice,"This very harsh brew gets tastier as one drinks more of it. It has a strong alcohol smell and a golden appearance with a tolerable head. The flavor is strongly alcoholic and harsh. Camo Black Ice is stinging in the mouth and tough to take at first. However, by the time I was about half way through the 24 oz. can (poured in a pint glass), I began to enjoy it. I prefer milder beers for daily drinking, but this would be something to have from time to time. I felt woozy for about three to four hours after drinking this. It’s rough.

Camo Black Ice,"I'm sorry, I haven't even wrote a review in a long time but I just had to log in to write this.
This is with out a doubt the WORST BEER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Its even an insult to call it beer or malt liquor because it is not in the same league as any other one I've tried.
Imagine taking old dirty wet socks and a bunch of leaves that you raked up, putting them together and adding lake water and letting it ferment and soak up all the flavor. Thats what this tastes like. It looks horrible, smells horrible, tastes, mouthfeel overall horrible.
Now for all the winos out there. This stuff is potent and will get you drunk very quickly so if thats your main goal and you can tolerate the taste, more power to you.
Note that Camo Silver Ice is 10.6% so just a bit stronger if your looking for that bang for your buck.
All in all awful beverage. You've been warned.",1.0
Camo Black Ice,"one of those beers that was given to me as a gag gift awhile back, sat in my fridge for some time, and finally got opened out of curiosity. the looks of it are really nice actually, clear golden in color with an inch of reasonably well lasting head, pure white, and leaving lacing as i swirl it. the nose isn't bad either, not at all. slightly stale and rather sweet barley and dextrose aromas, and some slight metallic oddness, but nothing way off, and not at all super boozy. the flavor is another story. the first sip is rather pleasant, i surprisingly taste grain first. it gets worse from their though. the second sip reveals a ton of sweetness, unnatural and very dense, while the third sip shows just how alcoholic it is. its a mess, and downright revolting by the third sip, more can than beer at this point. honestly on the whole its better than anticipated for so long, but the huge can and huge booze makes me timid. this would be warm by the end of it, which totally turns my guts around.carbonation is fine though the body is sweet and big. lager yeast flashes in, an odd appearance, and I'm wondering why so much residual sugar, just sloppy technique by whatever factory produced this thing. serves a purpose i guess, but not a purpose i hope to ever have...",2.0
Camo Black Ice,"Picked up in Wyoming mostly for morbid curiosity. How good can it be? Got to see some bad countries on the Earth to appreciate how great most of North America and Europe are compared to most of Africa.

But I have had Super Brew 15 in my mouth so I know bad when I put it in my mouth.

Poured in a glass just to be fair and like most malt liquor it does a passable job at looking like a lager. Clear gold with a small momentary white colored head.

Smells fruity as in fusel alcohol from beer fermented hot and fast. Malty and toffee candy. It is a bit spicy and I got the smell nailed. This smells like spiced caramel apple. There is a strong apple butter scent to this. Might actually give this some credit except I know what Fusel Alcohol does for hangovers. But to be honest doesn't smell that bad.

Moment of truth the taste.

Starts of thin and boozy. Tastes a lot like apple cider. And that is about it, tastes like Vodka and apple juice.

Mouthfeel is thin and the carbonation boils off pretty quick.

Overall this is a beer meant for hardcore alcoholics and college dorm parties.

This is cheap dumpster juice, and you shouldn't really expect anything from it. It's too sweet and contains a weird boozy astringency, even though it's under 6%. There's absolutely nothing to recommend here.

Milwaukee's Best Ice,"Looks medium gold with a substantial white head. Smell is slightly sweet, grain, and corn adjunct. Taste is smooth semi sweet, medium bitterness and semi dry finish. I’m at a loss to understand the low score, this is very underrated. For a value priced econo beer this is as good as it gets. Except for the slight adjunct flavor I can’t find much wrong with this. It’s not light or diet friendly but I think it tastes great. Must be kept very cold though. Cheers

UPDATE: 02/20/20
Well, sorry to disappoint but I still like this beer. $2.00 for a 32 oz. can. I still come up with the same smell/flavor profiles. It’s probably too much for you little sippers out there so I understand why you rate it so low. If your a normal manly man this beer will definitely satisfy. It’s way better than a typical malt liquor so don’t be scared to give it a shot. Make sure you get it as cold as possible, it is an “ice” beer.

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"Look, this is not your homemade Michelada. No one should get this expecting the flavors of a high quality bloody mary or something like that. Most of these reviews seem to be from lager drinkers who like flavored beer but don't understand what this is supposed to be. That being said, if you want an incredible hangover cure that has more of an msg taste than a salt taste (at least by comparison to a bloody or a homemade michelada) but is well balanced with the acid from the lime and tomato, this is your thing. The salt content is there enough that you will taste it, but very much more in a way that will make you grab this after a long bike ride rather than a day of sitting around. That being said, they're heavy enough in fill but light enough in alcohol that a couple of these will last you a day of sipping in the sun with no worries about driving home later. All in all, as a michelada lover and someone who has developed my own recipe based on tommy sandoval's, this is the one I keep coming back to when I need to remind myself what it's like, this is the base of the flavors that define this ""cocktail"" and it is wonderful for what it is.

I don’t know who this is made for, but it’s certainly not made for me. The back end is weirdly sweet tomato ketchup type flavors but also with an unpleasant spice to it. I don’t mind a bit of brine in certain beers, but it just feels so old and nasty with the clam juice in here.

L: cloudy, pinkish liquid; looks like a raspberry wit? but without any foam, suds of which explode and vanish on the pour... with subsequent pours, the murk gets murkier, and some nasty, spitty, tomato-y foam smears do cling, tomato specks abound

S: moderately-intense emanation of tomato juice and limey brine on the nose, however, little if any 'clam'; smells innocent enough, not necessarily off-putting, unless you have a depressingly dull diet... certainly has a fresh, floral overtone

T: tomato juice, mellow undercurrent of grain-soupy adjunct lager, light-moderate sea mist, barely a kiss of citrus color, but a rather forward peppery bite I wasn't expecting... almost a subtle tomato paste-y sweetness around the edges, but thankfully not sweetly-flavored like caramel or sugar... pepper and lightly malted tomato nectar prevalent in the aftertaste

F: mildly spritzy carbonation coupled with the peppery bite makes for an enlivening, burn/sting upon the tongue/palate, mellow heat building an embery fire... take the flavors away, and it's arguably rather wit-smooth in its textures up front, and relatively prickly-hot at the back like perhaps an egregiously coriander-ed extra-triple

O: should I be surprised that I enjoyed and was fascinated by this? - the recipe works well but, to my taste, I'd prefer a little more brine and maybe some umami-funk to give it more depth... not sure I'd quite go gangbusters experimenting on cocktail-ish flavor doctorings with this, but I can already think of a variety of ways to accent flavors here: lime wedge(s), (more) clam juice, anchovy oleo, celery salt, spicy mango, tequila chaser, et al... overtly Bloody Mary-like, noticeably/deliciously malty, and applicable within countless culinary scenarios - needs and begs to be paired with charred meats, oily carbs, spicy fruits etc etc... definitely going back for another - wow!

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"Blegh. The taste of tomato is so strong, it doesn't even taste like tomato. It's worse than a V8. It looks decent. but tastes like clam juice. Do not drink.",2.25
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"The best chelada bud makes. You get 25 ounces of tomato based clam beer beverage for $3, what more can you ask for? I'm an ipa guy, but the balance of spice, clamato, and budweiser creates a vortex of euphoria that smoothly slides down your throat. Look is typical of a chelada/michelada; off red/pink with floating bits of tomato. Smell is very tomato forward with the typical malt smell of budweiser. Taste is amazing, a perfect balance of spice and refreshing light beer, along with a decently high carbonation this is a great summertime beer..I drink a lot of these after being on the water all day, but also make great drinks after skiing too. A great all around beverage",4.75
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"Any flavored beer in a big can you gotta be skeptical. When my friend showed me this beer I couldn't believe what I had been missing. I like Budweiser but only on draft at a ballgame. It seems this is a perfect combination. I've mixed my own bud and tomato juice with a little worsteshire and lime, it's killer as well. But you can get 2 of the 25 oz. for $6, perfect. Great for hangovers. I can only drink 2 of them at the most as they taste packed with sodium. Then I switch to regular beer. Cheers!",4.5
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,I can't get enough of these red beer's ! I have bought out every local storeal around me and it look's like I may have to make my own for a bit ! I wish the distributor's would push these a little harder in our area . It's typical that you find something you really like and there is a very limited supply ! Awesome flavor and I wuld make a permanent place for it in my garage fridge if I could find more than a can or twould at a time !,5.0
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"I love everything about this beer. I didn't even want to try it because I hate all flavored beers. For me it boils down to the fact that my palate is geared so much toward savory than sweet. I also love a bloody mary and beer. I like every single flavor in this beverage. This is the only beer ""cocktail "" I have ever enjoyed. Other than this I strictly enjoy a mostly along the lines of a black and tan. On occasion a strong stout hits the spot.",5.0
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"I absolutely love this beverage. Now, I'm a boy from Texas, and I've been eating spicy food all my life, so to me a spicy tomato beer is par for the course.

I'd take this over a High Life anyday. Champagne of beers? No thank you. Give me that michelada knock off.

Now then, if you're a Northerner the advice that follows may not be for you, but if you're a spice man, like myself, then you've already done this, but if you fall somewhere inbetween I strongly suggest to you to dose this beer with a bit of hot sauce. Now, the type of hot sauce you can put on it can be almost anything. Tobasco will work, give it a bit more of a vinegar punch... But I've gotten into this Yucateca hot sauce, and that works like a charm.

It's great in the mornings, great at night, and great at lunch with some tacos from the local taco truck. Barbacoa especially.

Stay thirsty, my friends.",5.0

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"25 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 2/24/2018. Pours moderately murky/cloudy reddish orange/amber color with a minimal foamy off white head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing pretty quickly. No lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. Good appearance. Aromas of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of clams, vinegar, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt notes; with big strength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of clams, vinegar, and herbal/spice earthiness. Mild herbal bitterness and peppery spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt flavors; great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/saline/creamy tomato mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Lightly increasing pleasant lingering pepper heat through the glass. Overall this is a delicious fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/spicy finish. This is the best one in this style I have had. Was even better than the bud light version, very similar but with more clean malt presence. Most other cheladas I've had were too heavy on tomato juice/body. This is perfect balance of Budweiser and Clamato flavors; with plenty of malt presence for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example.",4.0
Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"Remember one of the BA rules “don’t rate styles of beer that you don’t like”. It seems as though people who don’t like a Chelada or beer ‘n clam as we call it in Canada are rating it hence the low rating.

I’ve been mixing my own beer ‘n clams since I was a teenager and love it! This is just coveniant as you don’t need to mix your own. Taste is great if you love the cocktail but the price (here in Canada anyway) is too expensive. It’s much cheaper to buy a cheep lager and mix your own but I buy these all the time for camping and fishing trips where I don’t want to bring cups, beer and a big jug of clam with me.

It is what it is. It’s beer and Clamato juice so if you don’t like beer and clamato than obviously you won’t like this drink but for my fellow beer ‘n clam drinkers, drink up! You’ll love it.",4.0

Budweiser & Clamato Chelada,"This is going be a polarizing beer cocktail. First, you've got to love both beer and bloody mary cocktails. If you just like beer then this is not for you. This is a pretty good blending of two disparate, yet compatible, drinks. The Bud version is infinitely better than the Bud Light version so I never buy the BL variety. What it is a nice refreshing beer cocktail suited well for the warmer weather months...if you also like your Bloody Mary cocktails but want more refreshing carbonation. Here's the deal as I see it. It's more beer-ish if you will and not unlike flavored brews. I could stand more zing and more tomato as such. But, it's refreshing and drinkable. No weird notes if your in for spicy tomato juice and enjoy some carbonation. It comes in either 16 or 25 ounce cans in my area and the 'big boy"" is all I want and is just right on a hot summer evening for a change of pace. Sure, a lot of folks will gag and I get that. However, if you are a well-rounded drink enthusiast this can have a place in your warmer weather rotation. The only thing I'd do if I was AB is to drop the Bud Light version and have two Bud renditions: this one and a bad@$$ BOLD one that is 6% or more ABV with a real wallop of pepper and tomato.",3.25

Look - From the bottle, clear golden with a small fizzy cap on top.

Smell - Weakly grainy with the namesake fruits in moderate amounts.

Taste - Grains turn up, rice adjunct becomes more apparent. Fruits stay moderate.

Feel - Watery light body with a spritzy carbonation. Swallows clean and finishes rapidly.

Overall - Was exactly what I was expecting. Michelob Ultra in itself is useless. More expensive than high life, with less flavor and alcohol. This variation is better than the base beer due to the added fruit aspects. Can't complain.",2.5

Most hard core beer snobs will cringe at this, but I love to add orange juice and make a beermosa with this beer.

Old Milwaukee Ice,"(16 oz can, OCT1419; purchased cold single... poured into fat tulip)

L: brilliantly-clear, pale yellow-amber liquid; rather tall, 2-finger high, relatively dense, white foam... slow collapse of foam, rocky center, then incredibly thick, crusty collar left, actually some long bands of lace... looks superb!

S: expected lightly-spiced, doughy aromas, with perhaps faint almond, vanilla notes... nutty, granola grain most dominant, but overall potency is a touch too mellow

T: richly malty, but relatively dry on the back end, not to mention that overtone of lightly caramel-y nuttiness, almost like a biscotto... a couple sips in, and a semi-bold, mildly herbal, cooling bitterness takes hold in the aftertaste, faint sweetish booze hanging in the back; balanced well... vaguely industrial Belgian tripel esters/phenols - great in a malt liquor, but lame in an actual tripel

F: as a malt liquor, this has a perfectly silky-smooth, lightly-luscious body, with a hearty quiet afterglow - for an AAL, it may have too rich of an initial contact, but falls short of any residual syrupy drag, though it ain't bone dry either... just divine, good grief; sipper or slurper, it does both

O: either one of the best ice beers I've had (if not the best), or a perfect marriage was made between liquid (and temp) and glass... I got a sort of 2-for-1 deal on these cans - tempted to have the other right after this, but I may need a nap after (1516)",4.25

Miller Lite,"Poured from a 12oz can best by Oct 10 2022

On the pour a nearly 2 finger lightly fizzy head formed and left some surprisingly decent lacing. Body is a darker golden straw carbonation is high but fine.

Aroma is malty, adjuncty, and has a bit of that cheap lager funk to it. I want to say I can detect hops similar to a pilsner but it's definitely leaning more toward cheap AAL. Not great, but for the style it's pretty good.

Taste is similar to MHL. A bit too sweet but relatively clean and light apart from the adjunct. Not a lot of bitterness but there is a very light hint. Not offensive not great but way better than coors light. This is light enough that I can taste carbonic acid like in a seltzer.

Feel is carbonated, relatively dry and easy drinking. A bit bigger than your average light beer, and with a longer finish. Completely average and it does its job.

Colt 45 Strong Beer,"While I am not aware of the legal classification that governments what is or isn't a malt liquor but I am sure the guidelines are not very strict.

The aroma is a pungent sugary sweet corn scent, mixed with a malty dank alcoholic warmth.
From the first sip you will realize that is marketed as less of a beverage and more of a means to reach intoxication.
Sugary, cereal mixed with corn make up the body, then hot gross sweetness like you get acid reflux.

Smells almost like rubbing alcohol. Tastes like the surgeon general's warning. Unless you are on very hard times and someone has offered you this for free, please avoid this and stop buying this.

Colt 45 Strong Beer,"710ml can (a 'seven ten', apparently) - I have my reasons, which are essentially along the lines of pouring one out for a friend's dog - rest in puppy peace, Czar!

This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden yellow colour, with four fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and only faintly fizzy off-white head, which leaves some random splotchy lace around the glass as it slowly and evenly abates.

It smells of gritty and grainy cereal malt, dextrose, Corn Pops, white grape juice, and rubbing alcohol. The taste is bready and doughy, er, malt, simple syrup, white wine dregs, the water in which you boiled the corn, sugary booze, and some ethereal earthy and dead floral bitterness.

The carbonation is pretty unremarkable in its milquetoast frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and actually fairly smooth, with only the firewater essence maybe acting as the fly in the proverbial ointment, to wit. It finishes off-dry, the generic malt and muted frooty notes fixing for a lingering donnybrook.

Overall - yeppers, this is exactly what the doctor (a known quack, but still) ordered, and actually quite tolerable when fridge-cold. However, the honeymoon fades fast as things start to warm, so I'd say that puts this one smack dab dead center in the bullseye of this style, amirite?",3.0

A moderate pour from the tallboy can produces a short-lived one inch head. It does have some stick to it. The beer is a pale golden and lightly carbonated.

The aroma and flavor actually emits slight tomato notes, somewhat like some malty lagers I've tried. There's definitely a fruity alcohol aroma, and a little bit of a corny DMS aroma, but not much. A little sweetness and tang on the finish. The flavor is overall rather neutral and bland, with no hop characteristics to speak of.

On the pour very fizzy carbonation and a 1 finger head with almost no retention form then dissipate back to almost nothing. Body is a clear light golden straw.

Aroma is similar to standard Bud with a bit more going on. Very yeasty lager, but not as bad as standard bud, but it's still a bit tart and funky for the style. Fermented rice is quite present but much else is hard to pick up on.

Flavor is similar to the aroma. Better than most other Bud products though to be honest. More full than Bud light, and even regular Bud, but still very light. Somehow the fermentation is quite clean on the aroma which leads into a ricey then light biscuit malty and very sweet note similar to miller in the finish.

Feel is surprisingly nice here longer finish but it's all malt and slightly dry as opposed to being grossly mouthcoating. It goes away right as you get sick of it.

Overall for a Budweiser product, let alone Bud Light this is pretty good. Way better then Bud Ice and somehow stronger, even better than standard Bud, and still pretty clean. If you like Bud or Miller and want a higher ABV.",2.75

This is quite a grainy beer but a smooth and easy-to-drink one, nonetheless. Finally, the feel is one of the best for an American lager.

Bud Light Platinum,"Not super good, but it's drinkable. Very sweet going in, with a noticeable aftertaste that is even sweeter and kind of...off. Not a snob so I'll just say this.

But if I am wanting to get beer drunk throughout an entire day, the 6% is very appealing with at least a tolerable flavor. 4/5 because its not the best flavor wise but hey, 6% is 50% more alcohol than 4%.

Bud Light Platinum,"Look: Pours a very bubbly golden yellow color with a half finger white head.

Aroma: Red apple, tangy pear. Some minor sour green apple. Gentle breadyness.

Taste: Cereal, mostly corn flakes and cheerios. Some lightly toasted bread. It tastes more malty than regular bud light, with less off-metallic and sour flavors. Red apple and pear in the background, coming in only briefly after the initial breadyness fades out. Ends on a clean, but somewhat tiresome flavor of white sugar.

Feel: Sticky. Medium body, Medium carbonation. If this was less syrupy it'd be a lot better, the sugar really comes through on the mouthfeel to make it feel a lot heavier than it needs to be. Borderline unctuous.

Overall: This isn't bad, but it's very sugary. I don't know if I'd buy this over bud light, mostly because of the body. Part of the appeal of BL is being able to crush multiple cans back to back. The mouthfeel on this is just slightly too sticky and sugary to be sessionable, but to it's credit it does have a better flavor, it's just not as ""crisp"" or refreshing. This would pair well with food like burgers and hot dogs, or really anything off the grill in the summer, although on it's own it's a little overbearingly sweet.",2.5
Bud Light Platinum,"I didn’t have a whole lot of confidence going in on this one. Good thing too. Poured from a 12 oz bottle:

Appearance isn’t bad. It pours a VERY light straw color with a bubbly white head that sticks around for a little while, at least around the circumference of the glass. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Not exceptional but not bad.

Smell. Uh oh. The smell was mainly alcohol, maybe a bit of corn, but it was very faint indeed.

Taste... yikes. The bottle says “brewed for the night.” I hope no one ever has as bad of a night as they must have been having when this came to be. It’s a bit sweet right off the bat, but then turns to a watered down argument between booze, corn, and hops, and the booze wins. The beer leaves an almost metallic film on my tongue on the way down.

Feel - the carbonation is nice, and the body is obviously light, but I cannot get over the nasty film in my mouth. Thankfully the beer is chuggable so it can be over quickly and the 6% doesn’t feel like it’s there until later.

Overall - Bud Light is preferable to this in almost any scenario I can imagine. Not good.

*Note*
I had a second bottle, this time while eating Fritos, and that seemed to help with the metallic film. Didn’t make the beer better though, haha.",1.25

So I wanted to give it a try.

Its a real refreshing beer very different that those lime beer. I got to tell u won t get drunk with that beer very easily.
Thats why I give a 3 because on a hot summer day drink 1 or 2 is definitely refreshing.

Coors Light Iced T,"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, it smells like iced tea and sugary lemon. In the taste, just as you would think, it tastes like iced tea with a bunch of lemon juice poured in it. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a sweet lemon iced tea like aftertaste. I guess this is a beer, but more a malternitive. Sweet tea beer, I guess there is a market for it.",1.5
Coors Light Iced T,"Last year it was lime, this year it would seem to be iced tea. Whatever, every beer deserves a chance.

Appearance: The pour produced a thin half finger of head that did not lace nor retain, so we aren't starting out well. Surprisingly a good amount of carbonation in the body, which looks like, well iced tea mixed with a light beer.

Smell: Unsurprisingly the smell of lemon iced tea dominates the nose. There's also a sugary note to it as well, with the barest touch of straw malt in the background. It's not bad, it's not especially good but it is as advertised.

Taste: I really want to try to analyze this beer but it, like the smell is as advertised. It tastes like Coors Light with some canned iced tea mixed into it. It works, just not very well as the malt takes away from the tea taste as it tries to struggle though, and the iced tea taste seems to mesh oddly with the carbonation. Still I've had worse.

Mouthfeel: Points get deducted for the complete lack of head. In this case here the carbonation seems to help bring out the iced tea taste, but instead of helping, it makes us realize why tea isn't meant to be carbonated. Nice mild iced tea aftertaste though, the beer seems to pull back the sweetness here.

Drinkability: Well, it's certainly refreshing but it's an odd beast to say the least. The high carbonation doesn't do it many favours, making it a bit gassy but it is easy enough going down. I don't know if I'd want more then a couple though.

Final Thoughts: I wouldn't regularly drink this, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. The problem here is I'd probably be more charitable if I hadn't already had Mill St Lemon Tea Beer which is the right way of doing this. Maybe give it a shot, but don't buy a six pack.",3.0
Coors Light Iced T,"Alright... so here it is. Coors Light Iced T, it's far from a beer. If you want to drink a BEER, stray far from this beverage. I really want to give this drink a fair review though, because it's really not that bad (as long as, again, you're in the mood for quaffing something other than a real beer).

Pours a colour slightly darker than the average macro, with a two finger head that quickly fizzles down to zero. No lacing, little cap.

Very sweet smell, dominant candy-like lemon scent, followed by tea, followed by the very faintest beer scent.

It doesn't taste much different than it smells. Sweet, candy lemon/iced tea with practically no malt or hops or anything that makes a beer a beer.

Soda pop like fizziness, very refreshing.

Call me crazy, but OVERALL, I like this drink. I wouldn't classify it as a beer by any means. It's like an iced tea cooler, only less sweet with no detectable alcohol flavours. If you gave it to a small child, they wouldn't know the difference between this and a carbonated iced tea soda pop concoction. It is incredibly refreshing. But I'll say it one last time, this is no beer. So beware. If you've ever wished for a soda that will get you buzzed, this is for you.

Coors Light Iced T,"The acronym of this beer causes me far too much amusement, so I wanted to try it in order to pan it honestly. Overall it's as sweet as a soda, and may appeal to those who would prefer a 4% soda on a hot day...

Insipid golden colour yields no head and has very little visible carbonation, although mouthfeel not as bad as I expected. Sweet aroma solely of ice tea. Likewise no sign of malted barley or hops in the flavour, just a sweet ""pop"" like drink. Fascinating.

Long live the craft beer movement!!",1.5
Coors Light Iced T,"Tallboy can from the LCBO. As an iced tea drinker, this at least looks like it might sort of be up my alley, certainly moreso than those stupid lime lagers that were all the craze a few years ago. Still, my expectations are... tempered, given the brewer.

Pours a translucent golden colour, a bit deeper than Coors Light but not much more attractive. The head looks rather promising at first - frothy and more than two fingers thick - but it fizzles away as quickly as any other macro light lager head, with absolutely no cap or lacing. The smell is ok - a bit lemony, but mostly just syrupy sweet Nestea-like flavour, with the actual beer-like aromas buried well beneath these overtones. Probably for the best.

The taste is tolerable, but rather muddled. The same sweet, syrupy commercial iced tea flavour from the aroma is here in force, with some slight lemon zest that provides a bit of (much appreciated) tartness. The aftertaste blends these flavours with the usual bland, diluted musty corn flavour of regular Coors Light. Light-bodied and watery, and very fizzy with its high carbonation, but something in the ingredients list gives it a slick, syrupy mouthfeel, which is definitely not an advantage for a light/adjunct lager. Drinkable, ideally served somewhere outdoors, with a high ambient temperature.

This definitely tastes more like iced tea than beer (not actual iced tea with tea leaves; just mass-produced Nestea/Brisk type stuff). I'm sort of on the fence here - I like this more than the regular Coors Light, but that's probably because it actually tastes like something besides fizzy water. Much like the regular stuff, this brew is clearly geared toward the palates of people who don't really like beer that much.

Final Grade: 2.2, a slightly-tolerable D grade. I really doubt this will take off like lime beers did, but I've been wrong before. For what it's worth, this is fairly refreshing, and far from the worst 'flavoured malt beverage' I've ever had. That being said, I doubt I'll ever buy this again. If I'm sitting on a hot patio, there are too many other brews I'd select first - a wit, a fruitbier, even a more orthodox pale lager or pilsener would be preferable over the deformed, cross-eyed chimera that is Coors Light Iced T.",2.5
Coors Light Iced T,Quite different than anything else out there. Being a Southerner I love some iced tea but didn't expect to like this. Turns out I love it. Smells better than most beer (sweetish) and tastes more like tea than it does beer. Will definitely be buying this again. Hopefully they keep it on the shelves and don't discontinue it.,4.5

Tastes better than that thankfully, some apple from the yeast, vague crackery malt. Dry aftertaste, thin and watery, bland. A real dumbed down lager, no structure or nuance at all, cheap buzz is all it is, at least it's not pretending.

Overall: A nice and easy drinking light lager. Slightly heavier bodied for the style, but not really too heavily bodied but rather a nice malt sweetness.

Yeah, that's pretty bad stuff. Syrupy thick, with a sticky adhesive mouthfeel that makes it rather off-putting when coupled with the high sweetness and corn adjunct-emphatic flavour profile. Ugh. I guess if we're searching for the good in it, there's some decent generic floral hop character.

Boozy, though not as egregiously so as the worst malt liquors. Difficult to drink in any case. This is definitely one to steer clear of, even within the budget high ABV category.

05/17/17: It prompts one towards self-reflection when one finds oneself experiencing this beer for a third time. (Budget was again a concern whilst attending an event, and it was essentially this or a direly overpriced 6 pack of expired Magic Hat).

Cloying syrupy rotgut. The kind of beverage that would pair well with dumpster fire roasted rat and an improvised cardboard mattress pad. I imagine one day sociologists will link availability of this swill with antisocial behaviour amongst perpetually itinerant populations.

I should have left this on the shelf for the recidivists. Straight up abysmal.

F / AVOID",1.25

St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,"This was a pretty good malt liquor. Drank out of the bottle, it had a very light yellowish brown color with a large head that receded quickly. Smells of corn and grain with a little bit of a honey sweetness. The taste is pretty decent with a a sweet corn taste with a very light honey aftertaste. It is well carbonated and it goes down smooth with a good alcoholic taste.",3.75
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,"Mostly yellow beer, substantial clarity. Aroma was rough industrial canned veggie and rubbing alcohol.

Lots of corn and cough syrup feels, cleaning products, fire alcohol water mouthfeel. Hella carbonated. Massive alcohol burn on this one. Not for the faint at heart.",1.5
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,"St. Ides.

Friend from my younger years stopped by recently and we sat around smoking copious amounts of marijuana and he added malt liquor into the equation for himself. For whatever reason, he decided it would be funny to leave Ken behind for me. And since I leave no stone unturned and no straggler undrank I figured why the hell not.

Look - From the Twenty-Four ounce can hard poured into some random glass from my kitchen. This brew pours a see through yellow with clarity beyond clarity along side a monster frothy white head that takes up most of the glass. This beer demands multiple pours. Carbonation is higher than astronaut pussy. No lacing nor stick amongst a finished glass.

Smell - It really isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Has all the typical malt liquor processed sugar and corn but the alcohol somehow manages to keep itself tame and it doesn't make me want to vomit in my mouth already from your moms spaghetti based on the smell. Now the real chore...let's see how it tastes...* takes sip *

Taste - Again, it is really dominated by the corn and cheap mass amounts of sugars. It's like an ultra alcoholic version of the malt liquor Magnum that I remember drinking when I was 18 while partying with some less than desirable women in Toledo, Ohio just off of West Alexis road. Didn't catch anything luckily.

Feel - Super thing bodied with a killer amount of carbonation to block out the flavors which is what I've come to expect with this style. Alcogol finally shows up but it isn't that bad. Swallows rather easily.

Overall - As far as a .79 can of malt liquor goes this wasn't so bad. Not going to win any gold medals obviously but it is drinkable. Likely going to feel this one tomorrow. Oh well, reminded me if being a teenager long ago in a land far, far away. Take it for what you will.",2.75
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor,Sometimes you just gotta summon your inner Eazy-E and drink a 40oz of the St. Ides. It's not as bad as it's made out to be but then again I do have a soft spot for malt liquor so I may be biased.,2.75
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"pours a fine looking beer. actually raiting this based off the 40 oz i opened a few weeks back, poured one pint of and twisted the cap back on. worth nothing its glass 40 oz. honestly i went to pour it out, and heard a nice big hiss, saw the beer do some fuckin' science in the glass, so i poured the thing in my glass. turned out to be a good move, its a solid unpretentious american hellesbock. head stayed on like a miller beer would. tastes like a pabst extra. rated to style.",3.5
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"This was a beer reminding me of my high school days and nights of drinking beers when we could get them. Nice to see that it is still around.
Poured a golden color with a fairly thick white head and very bubbly. The smell was malt, corn, bread and hops. The taste was malt, bread, and hops.",3.25
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a bite head. Smell is corn ,malt wheat and hay. Taste follows nose some citrus hops ,cracker meal malt grassy herbal note . Mouth feel is not boozy has a sweetness to it, could drink another for sure.",3.75
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"From a 24oz can:

Appearance: Clear yellow-gold, huge head.

Smell: Sweet corn, some stale hay.

Taste: Sweet, slight corn, sweet fruitiness-slight pear note. Medium to light body, sweetness lingers somewhat in the finish.

Overall: What better than some malt liquor over the 4th of July weekend? Finally trying the legendary Colt 45 as one of the local stores had it in 24oz cans. Not too bad, as with most in the style you want to drink it cold. No major flaws, a solid malt liquor that's up there with OE800 and Mickey's as good ones in the style.",3.25
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"Got a 24oz can best by August 1st poured into my warsteiner pils glass just for fun.

On the pour a 1ish finger head forms then becomes fizzy amd recedes to a ring around the glass amd light covering. Crystal clear generic lager color, a light straw gold, with lively carbonation. Looks like a decent cheap beer. And it almost wants to lace

The nose is surprisingly decent especially for the style. Some slight green apple off notes right up front, but not too far behind is an actual bready malt aroma that is present, possibly even some cheap but detectable hops on the nose. There is a bit of oxidized notes but this is way better than Olde English 800 for sure. As it warms the green apple flavor grows and becomes almost unpleasant but it's really just a cheap lager note that I get a lot in AAL beers a lot more than I'm getting in this one.

Flavor follows the aroma bringing a bit of corniness along with the malts. The hops largely disappear leaving only a hint of bitterness right up front that mingles with a bit of the green apple, then gives way to a largely pleasant and almost soft bready and corny malt/grain flavor. Coming in with low expectations I was very pleasantly surprised.

Feel is at first sip a bit watery with a quick finish and a big hit of carbonation bite, but as you drink more it hits the stomach quite heavily making this quite filling, which is a bit of a curve ball after everything else about this beer made me forget that technically this is a malt liquor. No complaints really however as this is the only spot that has even been close to reminding me what kind of beer I'm drinking.

Overall I've had beers that where a whole lot worse than this. Obviously I've had better but this is almost a decent American style lager. And at only 5.6% it's really not all that big a beer by today's standards. The only thing really making this a malt liquor is that it's been around since the only choices were bud miller and coors and it's a bit stronger than those BMC beers. Taste is actually surprisingly high quality for what it is.",3.25

Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"Pours a clear straw color with two fingers of lightly yellowed head that don’t last too long, but leave great lacing.

Corn, burnt toast and a hint of hops in the nose.

It’s sweet up front, but has considerably less of the green apple of other popular examples. A kiss of diacetyl extends into the otherwise dry, slightly toasty finish.

Highly fizzy mouthfeel — maybe a touch too fizzy.

This isn’t awful, but I prefer others in the style.",3.0
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"I mean the beer looks fine but everything else about this beer is abysmal. Don't ever buy this nasty beer. The smell made me gag, it burned on the way down, I don't even like Bud light and I will get that over Colt 45 anyday",1.0
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"24oz can, best by date NOV2221. Poured into an Arcoroc nonic pint glass.

A - pours golden yellow with a foamy head that leaves some lacing on the glass as it recedes. Poor head retention.

S - smells primarily of grain and adjuncts. As it warms there's a slight funk that becomes more noticeable.

T - Sweet malts and grains up front with a slight, tangy fruitiness on the finish which threw me off a bit. There's a boozy warmth that takes hold in my chest despite the lower ABV.

M - Thin-bodied with high carbonation; almost watery in its consistency.

O - Drinkable but disappointing. Would go back to this only if better brews weren't available. Tick completed.",2.25
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"Colt 45 is the same pale straw color as any other lager I’ve ever had. CO2 supports a rocky white head that practically melts into nonexistence as I type this.

Taking a sniff, the first thing I smell is cooked corn. Coming in at 8% abv, it’s no wonder the next aroma I pick up resembles rocket fuel. Corn and rocket fuel are supported/accentuated by up front aroma of soda cracker and pale, grainy malt. Everything else is pretty straightforward, leading into an aroma that has barely any detectable hop presence at all.

On the tongue, Colt 45 is kind of smooth but has an oddly slick mouthfeel to it. Flavors of cooked corn start things off before moving into an almost astringent graininess. Then, the center comes along with its high octane booziness. Colt 45’s flavors are an almost barren wasteland of dryness as they move through the center to a finish that only gets some of its roundness back. Too bad, there’s not an ounce of real refreshment anywhere in this beer.

There are no redeeming qualities to this malt lager no matter how hard I look. It’s alcoholic, boozy in a bad way, and not well balanced at all. Its only redeeming quality is that it’s cheap and strong",2.5
Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"Somewhat surprised that this was the first time I've had it. As a younger man, it was almost a game to try as many economy beers as possible.

Poured from a pint can into a pint glass. Straw yellow, astonishingly clear, decent sticky head retention. Generic beer sent. Sweetness makes it highly drinkable. Mouthfeel is watery. I'd much prefer this to a core Bud or Miller product.",3.0

Colt 45 Malt Liquor,"Economics compelled me, so why not review it? It pours almost flat with some mild carbonation. I can read my aspirin bottle through it. It does smell like a beer.

Amsterdam Maximator,"June 2007: 500 ml can, supplied by my friend Olav. Brewed by ""Dutch Export Breweries"". ABV was 11.6%. Golden colour, moderate head. Weak aroma, a hint of white wine and honey. Very sweet and alcoholic flavour. Pretty bad.",1.5
Amsterdam Maximator,"Managed to get to the review box without seeing previous ones...yesss..! It's difficult.

Left out the fridge for 30 minutes before drinking.

Initial impressions, I do not like the green can much. For me green is not beer. It's the devil or maybe wheatgrass juice or broccoli.

For a strong beer at 11.6%, it is very light. Basically like a lager, with a bit more colour. Head goes down fast.

Aroma has no fruitiness, nothing complex...just fizziness and a hint of sawdust.

Not looking forward much to the taste...

Taste is intense, spirit like. Much better than a lager like Carlsberg or Heineken, as at least there is taste. Though the taste is alcohol, almost vodka, and not a complex brewed taste with lots of flavour, This is obviously made for the alcohol, not the taste. The perfect beer for someone who hates their life, wants to get drunk, forget things, and who wants to save money as much as possible.

Would I drink if I was homeless..? For sure. There is fuck all else to do and I probably do not want to break another tooth opening a bottle of Chimnay Bleu.

The taste has elements of honey, lots of sweetness (surprising for such a strong beer).

It's my opinion that the ingredients are false. They have basically mixed beer with pure alcohol and sugar. Therefore alcohol should be on the ingredients. Perhaps they do not have to add this as a seperate one...haha clever.

This has not been brewed, it has been mixed.

Still, it's better than a mass produced lager. Though, really it is the same, just mixed with alcohol. So it gets a pretty low rating from me...",1.25

Amsterdam Maximator,"Got this one in Normandy at a grocery store. This one is Max Intense! Described as a ""beer rich in ingredients"" with a ""long brewing process.""

From a 50cl can into a pint glass

APPEARANCE: Pours a three finger, loose looking, white head with decent retention. Really loose and chunky looking. Perfectly clear amber orange with medium carbonation. Force carbonated. Fades to a chunky wisp and leaves foamy, chunky wisp on the sides of the glass. Splotchy wisp leaves some foamy lacing down the glass.

SMELL: Bread and grainy malts, corn, and some alcohol.

TASTE: Rough going. Boozy and sweet grain up front, with sweet bread and corn into the finish. A bolder finish is boozy with alcohol, corn and sweet grainy malts. Not pleasant in the least. Harsh.

PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. A little light, goes down airy and bubbly with a harsh burn at swallow and finishes slightly sweet on palate. Some alcohol lingers.

OVERALL: Not a doppelbock at all. This is simply a strong Euro pale lager, and a really strong one at that. I guess it's better than malt liquor, but the only reason one would even consider drinking this would be to get mashed on the cheap. I can't believe a brewer would taste this and go, ""yes, this is exactly what I wanted...""",1.5

Amsterdam Maximator,"Originally bought a can of this in Singapore at a convenience kiosk. I bought it because it was cheap, strong, and I like to try new beers. It is the best prank beer I have ever had... By this i mean that every time I went out in town with a different one of my shipmates, I told them about this ""heavenly"" beer that they must try because it is without a doubt the best drinking experience they will ever have. I was of course lying to them, which brings me to my review:

Pour: Left it in the can for fear of Singapore's strict environmental laws.

Aroma: Alcohol and sawdust.

Taste: Alcohol, fermented sugar, corn-nuts, and a hint of earwax in the finish.

Mouth/face: Twisted in disgust (This reaction is what kept me exposing poor individuals to this particular brew, and I would often take pictures of my victims during this phase of tasting).

Overall: Good for pulling a fast one on one of your buddies, even if it means you have to suck it up and down one with them (My version of keeping it fair). Consume only for getting drunk or preparing your taste buds for eating handfuls of Thai chilies.",1.0
Amsterdam Maximator,"We pour a clean, goldenrod colored brew. It holds a one finger head of tan bubbles, but this disappears on the quicker side, leaving a thick sheet of patterned lacing. Carbonation is active, and there is a mild haze throughout. The aroma is bold, with wheaty and pale malts. There is a stark tropical fruit quality, with passion fruit and pineapple right up front, with some strawberries to boot. This adds a unique sweetness. There is a menthol, minty quality, with surprisingly raw, piney hops. The alcohol is ever present, especially with warmth. As we sip, holy crap. It is like drinking a fruity nail polish remover. The front is dominated by insane metallics, mixing with lightly buttered toast, and those interesting fruity notes from the nose. There is distinct pineapple here, with an added dipped-in-sugar sweetness. The middle moves forward with offensive fusel alcohols, fermented apples, and bittering metallic malts. The finish shows more vodka alcohols and copper, tinny metallics. There is honey sweetness, and more of those strawberries. The aftertaste is burning with booze, fresh cherries, more bitters, and surprisingly pale malts. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. The mouth is left dry, but with an initial metallic film. There is okay cream and froth, but little slurp or pop with each sip. Due to the high alcohol presence it is very puckering. The abv is huge, and the beer drinks very slowly.

Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the nose. It had great fruity inclusions that were not expected, making for a sweet and inviting aroma. When we sipped, however, we were horribly disappointed. Each sip was like taking a shot of cheap, Canadian beer-flavored vodka. It was extraordinarily hard to drink.

S: Smell is repulsive. Honestly the homeless people I've seen drinking this crap could've pissed back into the can and barely told a difference.

Mouthfeel of this is light, well carbonated and quite refreshing with a pleasant softness to it.

Tastes of caramel accompanied wheat and white bread rind, together with a well nuanced initial hop dryness, getting wrapped up by more pronounced toffee later on. Offers a creamy graininess then, with a faint herbal undertone to it and more caramel wheat. Finishes with a great softness, crackers and a rock sugar highlighted maltiness.

Aroma: Mild aromas of pale malts, adjuncts, corn, some yeast before more corn adjuncts linger on the finish.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of pale malts, corn adjuncts. Strong yeast in the middle before the corn adjuncts follow through to the finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation, to finish clean and dry. Slightly astringent from the yeast and corn.

Compared to Budweiser 5/10/22: Pours a similar, slightly lighter color. Stronger aromas. More corn adjuncts. Less pale cracker malts and bread. More astringent on the finish.

Overall: Drinks pretty much how I would expect a Miller Draft to drink. Similar to their Miller light but with a stronger malt body.

Miller Genuine Draft,"Fresh Can Edited review

Unfortunately just drinking it out of the can so no look update but I'm sure it's still good these are gushers when you crack em

Smell is not disgusting this time. Not fantastic but an actually passing grade. The average American lager smell with a nice dose of sweet malt behind it. Still some skunk and in the can a bit Metallic as well, but nowhere near as bad as an old bottle of this stuff damned clear bottles.

Taste is essentially a malt bomb but still crisp with most of the sweetness showing up in the aftertaste. Slight bitterness that goes away as you drink but no hop character. Very bready but smooth.

Feel is actually quite nice not the best part of the beer anymore but it's more impressive than I made it out to be in my other review. Head makes it creamy, but co2 bite isn't a big part of this beer the head just takes over.

Overall better than the beer I got a while ago the can protects it pretty well and it tastes like it's pretty fresh too. It's a malty sweet refreshing treat that's easy to put down and cheap. Tastes pretty good too when it hasn't gone bad.


~~~~~~~~~~OLD REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~
Poured from a presumably old clear 12oz bottle into a pint glass.

The look is an average adjunct with a surprisingly good head going for it and lively carbonation. A golden straw color with no haze. Somehow the head that sticks around for the whole drink and actually forms a lot of lacing here.

Smell is bad. Very UV struck and skunky as fuck pardon my french. So skunked it's almost like dog shit it's bad. I dont know how old it is, but jeez. They need to start putting this in brown bottles cause around here it seems like it sits. Just lager skunk and a bit of shit.

If I dont breathe through my nose it's much better than the smell and actually drinkable maybe even better than a bud. I'm sure if somehow I got a better bottle it would be better but I'm not sure if that's possible around here so the smell score stays, but the taste is actually quite nice. A sweet malty lager. No hop really to speak of, that probably all got destroyed by the stupid branding desicion to put a slow mover in a clear bottle.
Malt is actually malty and if I couldnt smell my breath I'd call it drinkable, until I catch a whiff of my breath.

Feel is dead average for the style. Not watery, but not dense or think in any strech of the imagination. Definitely one of the better parts of this beer, other than all that lacing, like damn.

Overall I'm sure this has more potential than the bottle I got, but this was rough. The smell of skunk almost made this a bottle pour. At least this actually has lacing.",3.0

I got a thick head over an inch which lasted about 2 minutes. Color is pale with a lively effervescence and very clear. This beer looks great. Disappearing head left a nice lacing of froth on the sides of my glass. Not much smell. Maybe a little metallic with a slight earthy aroma. Definitely has a metallic aftertaste with a little bit of bitter. Not much taste at all while its going down. This is not a very exciting beer and you'll have to drink it very quickly if you want a buzz from it. This is a good beer to enjoy cold with some BBQ and friends before undertaking some sort of summertime activity that requires you to not be overly sedated. I don't recommend drinking more than 2 per sitting. Afterwards go do something to work off that 144 calories per bottle. On sale for 18 bucks for 20, I'd just as soon drink PBR which is a little less expensive and probably a little more flavorful. Still, I think this beer deserves better than it seems to get around here. It has it's time and place. I'm glad we drank this stuff as teenagers because if we had stronger beers like are common now, we might not have survived.",3.25
Miller Genuine Draft,"had this beer from the USA when I was younger 25 years ago.
I bought a can at the lcbo in Ontario they now brew it here in Canada by Molson Coors just like the Coors banquet they call it Coors original now here in Canada .
473ml at 4.7%.
poured a 1finger head into glass that quickly disappeared. but left a lace as I was drinking it
again they brew it better in The USA not a fan of this MGD beer in Canada a little better in The USA i think
overall another crap beer from Molson Coors trying to copy the original MGD from the USA. would have gave the original MGD from the USA a 3.08

Miller Genuine Draft,"Macrobrews don't come by this way often, but when it does it's usually MGD. Say what you will, but I find it easy to drink (out of a bottle... no cans, here) and reminiscent of rural weddings where - while they did have champagne - this champagne of beers was probably almost as good, and it went with everything there as it does on a hot Wisconsin day. Maybe it is nostalgia, but this slightly honey-colored brew that smells of little and has just a bit of effervescence is a simple beer for a simple man.",3.5
Miller Genuine Draft,"(January 2005). Seriously struck by rating addiction, I bought this beer only to rate it - and I hate myself for it! Hate hate hate!! I paid good money for this crap, in the US at least it’s cheap - here it’s expensive. Importing this shit to Europe is totally ridiculous! And the alternative in Norway, if you want an American beer, is Bud!! (If you’re ’lucky’, you might find Michelob!) My expectations were very low, but I soon found out that this ’beer’ was even worse than I expected. Aroma reminiscent of the wine yeast of my disastrous, short lived wine-making career 15 years ago. Excessive head that disappears rather quickly. Hardly any flavour at all - just a bland, metallic mouthfeel. Luckily, there is no aftertaste either (if there was, it would surely have been bad). ’Genuine draught’ my ass! This is just bad, real BAD!!",1.25

Poured from a can Into a pint glass.

Miller Genuine Draft,"Straight outta the gate, I'm not a big fan of Miller products, finding the majority of them too light and smacking of adjuncts.
I purchased MGD for the first time because I'd be drinking a few with some BBQ and simply wanted something lighter and frankly, cheap.

Surprisingly, MGD wasn't bad. Nice ""beery"" yellow-gold. Head lasted down to the bottom of the glass!
Light malt nose with light grassy hops peeping through. Taste exactly like the nose, only with a mild corn aftertaste.
I'm still not a Miller fan, but being as neutral as possible for this review, this was a pretty decent beer.",3.5
Beck's Premier Light,"First off, I am not a fan of light beers. But this doesn’t really taste like other light beers. True, it doesn’t have much color or body, but compared to every other “light” beer I have sampled, this beer hits it out of the park. It actually has some flavor. I have not tasted anything close to this that has only 64 calories. Plus, it only has 2.3% alcohol, perfect for hot summer days when you want to drink more than a few beers and still stay relatively sober. Given the low calorie and alcohol content, this is a superior product.

I think most reviewers are being somewhat unfair with their reviews. If you lined up 10 other light beers along with this beer in a taste test, this beer would stand alone as real beer flavor. True, if you did the same comparison with 10 other non-light German style beers, it would finish last, but that would be unfair because this is a light beer.

For what this is, a low alcohol, low calorie beer, this is, by far, the best beer I have ever tasted.",3.0
Beck's Premier Light,It’s barely better than drinking carbonated water. I’m on a diet so this is what I’ve got.,1.75
Beck's Premier Light,"The scores reflect my company Beck's Light to all other beers possible, but really you would want to review it against other beers in it's category: Light Beer.

Pros:

A lot of flavor for 64 calories. Against other super low calorie beers the difference in taste, and feel, is remarkable. It is also filling like it's calorie high original. Though it does this by being quite foamy. The low alcohol content and filling quality of this beer means you can nurse them all night and not get drunk. You can sober up nursing a six pack of these!

Cons:

Bloated from the fizz. If you intent to get drunk by drinking this you might want to think again. You'd have to have a hearty ability to drink!

Overall: I like this beer when I go to a poker party. Everyone wants to do shots and drink. But they don't know I'm drinking a beer that will sober you up. They assume it's German and therefore must have lots of alcohol. Great beer if you are the DD. You can nurse them and never get drunk.",2.75
Beck's Premier Light,"I recently made a field trip our to Subs & Six Packs on Columbia Avenue while running another errand. I saw this in the cooler & when I realized that I had never heretofore reviewed it, I seized upon the opportunity.

From the bottle: ""Beck's Quality Brewed Under the German Purity Law of 1516"".

I Pop!ped the cap only to get a wafting odor of old Noble hops and corn silage. Ugh. I upended the bottle to get it over with & briefly got two fingers of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that quickly dissipated to wisps for my trouble. Color was Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 -2) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like Saaz hops that had seen better days, along with a corn malodor that did nothing for me. Ugh. Mouthfeel was thin & watery. Ugh. The taste was just more watered-down AAL, corn & Noble hops wasted in a brew that can only be intended for the uninitiated. Ugh. Finish left me with a good case of buyer's regret. Ugh.",2.0
Beck's Premier Light,"not all that bad for a light beer. It still has a full flavor and body to it unlike most light beers so that's a plus, a negative though is that it is super light on ABV% at 2.3% so you're gonna end up drinking a lot of them just to get a good buzz.",2.5
Beck's Premier Light,"Slight grainy smell, but that's it. Not much smell at all. Not good or bad.

Standard light beer color. Maybe a bit lighter than usual.

The taste, however... it's like someone mixed a tablespoon of Stella into a cup of lightly carbonated seltzer. I don't mind the taste of light beer, but not when it's diluted to this extent. Somehow, it manages to be one of the most offensive flavors I've ever experienced.

This remains the only beer I've ever come close to not finishing. I guess this is how beer snobs feel when they drink a macro lager. I'd honestly recommend it just to see how bad it is. Buy a six pack and share it with your friends. Find out how close you really are.",1.0

Beck's Premier Light,"I read many of the reviews. This is a Light Beer folks...it will not taste like the ""full bodied"" (regular) Becks Beer.

Look: A little pale in color, but no different from other Light Beers.

Smell: I read comments on how ""skunky"" it smells, it smells about the same as the full bodied Becks (to me).

Taste: I think Becks Light taste great, less ""body"" than the regular Becks, but still taste like Becks (to me).
This is not a Craft Beer, and cannot compete against good Craft Beers. Remember, the only other Light Beers with 64 calories are ""Miller 64"" and ""Miller Genuine Draft 64"", and this taste much better than they do.

Feel: Becks Light Beer lacks the ""full bodied"" presence of the regular Becks Beer, and the head is not note worthy.

Overall: I like the beer for what it is (a European style beer with only 64 calories per 12oz. bottle), not what it is not. It is not a Craft Beer (not even close), but if you like this style of beer, it taste quite good. I drink it all year round as my standard Light Beer, and enjoy many fine Craft Beers as well. Indeed, because I drink this light beer regularly, I really enjoy other good beers too.

Conclusion: If you accept this beer for what it is (a mass produced Light Beer) it is quite good, and certainly better (to me) than Michelob Ultra, Miller Light, Miller 64, Miller Genuine Draft 64,Bud light, and others. It is a great every day beer.",4.5

They aroma, ah what can I say, I really dont know what the hell it is...perfumy, metallic, damp straw thats starting to mold? Not overpowering, but different.
Taste, very carbonated feel that leaves a really smooth texture on the tongue, a grassy, wheatie, slightly watery brew. As the brew continues to warm, the smoothness hangs in there even as the metal becomes more present.

Jaguar High Gravity Lager,"Jaguar High Gravity Lager has a medium, white, fizzy, quickly-dissipating head, no lacing, and a clear, very bubbly, yellow-golden appearance.

Tastes like the same. Crap adjuncts, added sugars. Sticky, mealy, astringent feel. Deadening alcohol on the palate. Sweet grainy taste, some fusels.

S - Compared to Earthquake this is downright terrible. Alcohol, rotting fruit and garbage, and god knows what else.

T - Taste is a tiny bit better, as it dials down the rotten flavors and replaces them with sickeningly cloying sweetness. Not as boozy as some of the other malt liquors, although this is a ""light"" one at 8.3%.

M - Surprisingly chewy texture, with a dry finish but tooth-coating stickiness. Not as much heat as Earthquake unsurprisingly. Carbonation is moderate to low. Somewhat indescribable, and not in a good way.

Jaguar High Gravity Lager,"Welcome to Malt Likkapalooza VII. Today's feature bout will be between yet another pair of malt liquors brewed in the state of Wisconsin. I find it hard to believe that dozens of different variations are even possible when it comes to beer like this. I guess minor changes in sugar content and ABV are enough to earn new can graphics. Anyway, on with the show...

Amber with a generous splash of orange; definitely the darker of these two combatants. The head is bone white in color, a finger or two smaller and doesn't look as good as the head on the other beer. The early lead goes to Camo Silver Ice.

The nose reminds me of apples macerated in grain alcohol. I still don't think that beer of this style (even the worst examples) smells as bad as the worst macro lagers, but that's just me. In any case, this one isn't likely to win any prizes.

Neither one of these two is anywhere close to good beer. I mean that in a general sense and when compared to the best malt liquors out there. Jaguar is excessively grainy and is more boozy than malty sweet. It may not be possible to brew a high gravity lager with such a high ABV that's worth a damn. I'm pretty sure I've had some decent ones though.

Who really cares about the mouthfeel in a malt liquor? They're both par for the style course, with a medium-full slickness that doesn't quite reach sticky. Zippy carbonation keeps things moving along without feeling overly fizzilicious.

Malt Likkapalooza VII has not been a stellar showing for either one of these brews. Jaguar has the cooler can, so that counts for something. Of course, it doesn't really matter since the brown paper bag will ensure that the can graphics can't be seen anyway.

F: it's not all-out syrupy, but there's definitely a concentrate or two slick-sliding though its core... for 8%, the booze is buried rather well... not laborious to swill; fantastically mellow in its alcohol presence, but nonetheless a tad too weighty (also mostly, entirely copied from my Lime-a-Rita review - finding out these things are one-note)

O: thought the taste of this would wash out that of the 'flagship' Lime-a-Rita I just had moments ago, and boy was I right... this is seriously carbonated (malty) strawberry Mad Dog 20 20... the flavorings of these are to-taste with everyone, naturally, but 2 brands in, and it's apparent each variation was designed to appeal to an adolescent palate (1468)",2.0

Taste - I bought this to give it a try because i like margaritas. This doesn't taste like a margarita and is too carbonated to even remotely be similar. I knew it would be not like a authentic margarita but it isn't close enough. It tastes like mountain dew soda, can't even pick up the alcohol. The sweetness level is nuts. It needs more lime or strawberry flavor and less sugar. The only real fruit flavor is cherry.

Bud Light Lime Straw-Ber-Rita,"Poured from the can into a Budweiser pilsner glass.

A giant bit of fizz, with a fast dissolving and noisy pink/purple like head. No puck or collar, and some very fast soda cabonation. Body color is a neon Hawaiian Punch color, a sort of dark neon pink and red.

The aroma is just massive as soon as the can is opened. It smells like Hawaiian Punch and incredibly sticky sweet. There is to credit though a mix of rock salt and lime giving off the instant margarita in a slushy machine vibe so it's at least true to form.

Palate is a bit of a surprise. Slight syrup but not totally in feel. Touches of boozy fruit strawberry, and a bit of sugar but not horribly. Lime tang a bit in the mid palate that makes for a good contrast to the non strawberry sweetness. Once again, alcohol goes right into your gut and system.

A - Pours a golden color. Initially thick foamy white head recedes quickly; poor head retention and no lacing. Lots of small bubbles rising through the brew.

S - Adjuncts, alcohol, and malty notes abound. ABV is not very well hidden here.

T - Malt and sweet corn to start, with fusels and a faint sour apple flavor showing up on the finish. Not as egregiously tart as Stack 101 but it's noticeable.

M - Thin-bodied with medium carbonation. It goes down relatively easily, but the mouthfeel of this HGL leaves much to be desired outside of that.

While not bad, nothing about this beer stood out from under the label. Drinking straight from the can, I can't speak of colour or clarity, though a lager that doesn't try to coat me with the head foam as I open it isn't trying hard enough.

Taste - Like a brownie covered in black pepper. Incredibly sweet, slightly chocolatey, and a strong alcohol bite.

Feel - Thin body, very mild fizz, and some throat burn. It needs to either be thicker or bubblier.

Overall - I had low expectations based on its $1.50 price tag, and it hit them. It's not good, but it isn't offensive. I'd have it again, but it definitely wouldn't be a first pick.",2.0
Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,"Why am I rating this? The hell if I know, let's say desperate times call for desperate measures.
Poured into what? Uhmmmm...just a regular pint glass.
The appearance was a glossy clear yellow to mild orange color with speedy carbonation rising to fill a rapidly dieing head. No lace.
The aroma had stiff sweet corn, rice, fusel alcohol and burnt grass.
The flavor had a huge alcoholic sweet buffing throwing itself into burnt grass, burnt toast and sweet corn. The aftertaste was distracting through fusel alcohol, sweet corn and burnt grass and toast.
The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with no sessionability whatsoever. It's a sipper by all means, that's if one wants to sip it. Carbonation did feel appropriate for what this is supposed to be. ABV seemed as projected. Finish was fusel alcohol, sweet corn and burnt toast.

Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,"Bought this at my local Kwik Fill after getting out of work. Wanted to try something I haven't had before.
Appearance: Golden malt liquor color. Didn't actually know this was considered Malt Liquor by most people.
Smell: Smells like your average american adjunct brew.
Taste: Really isn't bad, but isn't necessarily amazing either. Pretty average and definitely tastes more like an ale for a high gravity brew. Disguises the alcohol well.
Feel: Decent carbonation, and again this one tastes and feels just like a typical lager/ale all the way through.
Overall: Anyone who takes a look at the can before buying knows that this is something that is going to get you buzzed quickly. And for that, you should already know.49 what you are getting into (especially when you are paying less than 2 dollars for 24 ounces). I thought that for the style and price, this was a decent brew. I wouldn't seek this one out, but when I am looking to get my buzz on, this would definitely be an option. I paid $1.49 for this. Considering Blue Moon is the next step above this, and that you would have to drink two BM's to achieve the same buzz, this gives you the best bang for your buck (a pint of Blue Moon in my area is $2.20). I was also happy to find out Genesee Brewing Co. based out of Rochester where I am from, made this and not some mainstream Maco company like Coors or Bud Light which amazingly dominates the market.

Dog Bite High Gravity Lager,"Rock Wall Brewing Co. ""Dog Bite High Gravity Lager""
24 oz. can, no freshness dating
$1.79 @ Weis Market, Conshohocken, PA

Dog Bite is a surprisingly fruity malt liquor, delivering notes of apple and grape. It was so fruity in fact that I had to check the label to make sure it wasn't flavored. As to its being a ""lager"", yes it's lager yeast, but it's clearly fermented warm.

It appears in the glass like any other malt liquor with a deep golden body beneath a short head of white foam. The head retention is fairly good, and it actually leaves some really nice, although thin, lacing about the glass. It's somewhere between medium and medium-full in body, and just below standard carbonation at maybe 2.4 volumes CO2/liter which leaves it smooth across the palate.

The aroma is malty with the suggestion of fruit and a touch of alcohol.

Beyond the fruitiness there is alcohol, but it's not ""hot"", and there's also a note of sugary, almost mint (which may or may not be coming from hops) as well as a pleasant note of cereal and some floral character. It's not overly sweet though, especially for a malt liquor, and despite its limited bitterness it's still able to dry in the finish; and that's great because unlike many others in the category it doesn't build upon the palate.

Although I was initially surprised by the fruity component, it's not something negative within the style, and is actually pleasant. It gives it some character and charm. For fans of the style I'd say you have to check it out.",3.5

Served in a Firestone Walker pils glass

A - It pours a crisp golden color that is devoid of any floating imperfections. The effervescent body continuously feeds a brilliant white cloud of foam that leaves traces of its presence down the side of the glass.

S - It has an initial sweet candy aroma. Upon further investigation I discover the scent of candied apple and some floral notes.

T - The taste begins sweet with some grain flavors. Then a floral taste crosses my palate. Then I get smacked with the alcohol. Then, as quickly as it came, the alcohol taste subsides leaving a clean, crisp finish.

M - Thin with biting carbonation.

O - This beer starts out a little harsh. Once the 8% numbs my tongue it becomes rather easy to drink. It is an exemplary example of an underappreciated style.",3.0

Better than Coors Edge, but still on the sweeter side and imbalanced as a result. Cereal grains, amber malt, faint toastiness. No real hop flavour is present. Has appealing caramelization but the lack of balancing hop bitterness renders this beer out of balance.

I'm not of fond of O'Doul's Amber as I am the original O'Doul's but as far as Non-alcoholic beers go they're both pretty damned good. This is crystal clear with a copper colored body beneath a short head of off-white foam. The head retention and lacing are average. The aroma offers some grainy malt with just a hint of caramel and even less hops but it does smell like beer. The flavor gives you a little too much of that maltiness upfront and the first sip let's you know you're drinking an NA. The good news is that after that it tastes very close to a full alcohol beer, and there's some additional biscuity malt and some mild floral and lightly herbal hop character to it. It's perfectly balanced by a moderate bitterness and it finishes fairly dry with just a touch of malt remaining. In the mouth it's medium-light in body and crisp with a standard carbonation. Overall it's a nice NA.

S: immediate relative potency to the smell, mostly sugar cookie, lightly-baked lightly-sweetish dough aromas... relatively poppin', subtle spice; cookie-like all the way

T: dried grassy-grainy angle up front; almost a white wine dry fruit note carrying out the finish, lingers too... white flour, simple cookie dough malt flavor prevalent... lightly spicy, lightly bubblegum aftertaste, with the doughy malt looming large... floury, lightly tangy note dominates

F: mildly effervescent; nondescript body contours... dry and light long after each sip, but with a head-tilting (phenolic?) warmth... does seem to have a bit more body than its contemporaries, but it's still light enough - probably better swilled chilled from can

Tecate Light,"Pours that familiar light beer light yellow with lots of clarity and a soft white head in the 1/5"" range once it settles down (quickly). Aroma of some grain, not much beyond that. Lager yeast not really perceptible here.

Taste, a familiar interaction of sparsely used super high alpha acid hops that provide only bitterness and almost nothing in terms of flavor. There are no off flavors or sulphuric badness like in some garbage tier light beers. Its not great or anything, but its probably better than ratings here tend to indicate in the aggregate. Would seem to be nothing wrong and even a welcome respite in the summertime, throw one of these in between some more robust stuff you're drinking, get a little hydrated, shits saul goodman. I'm guessing from the mouthfeel this isn't 100% barley. Not overly sweet like some when you have that corn/corn syrup going on. Lots of carbonation. I think these are worthy of having around in the summer for a hydration and palate cleansing break, as well as for people who aren't that into beer.",2.75

Carlton Draught,"Format: standard light brown 375mL bottle with a macro label.

Appearance: a dark golden-amber colour with a fluffy white head that drops away quickly. Pretty disappointing.

Aroma: not very much on the nose, just some corn adjuncts and cheap grain. Okay at best.

Taste: not very much again. The cheap grains are joined by a vegetal note. Not particularly offensive, but quite boring.

Aftertaste: the flavours drop away quite quickly. A pretty basic adjunct lager.

Mouth feel: light in body with a medium to higher carbonation. Reasonable.

Overall: I'm really not sold on Carlton Draught. Even their very funny ads aren't enough to make me realise that their other beer VB is cheaper and much better. Carlton Draught is not worth the AU$46 a case.",2.5

Corona Extra,"Poured from a can into a glass. The appearance is crystal clear straw color with a soapy white head that quickly fizzles away.

The aroma is slightly sweet, green apple and corn with hints of flower and grass.

The taste is pretty much the same as the nose. Green apple skins, grainy, lightly sweet, hints of corn, a little bit of white flowers and grass on the back end. Zero bitterness. Finishes as crisp as the aforementioned apple.

Mouthfeel is...fine? Light but not watery. Fizzy. Drinks like a pretty typical carbonated beverage. Super crisp and clean, though. Almost nothing is residual.

Wow. I was surprised by how much I liked this, at least from this format. A skunky bottle might have given me a more negative impression. This is a solid, refreshing corn lager. If you go in thirsty with no aloft expectations, you'll probably enjoy it, too!",4.0
Corona Extra,"consumed straight from the 12oz clear glass bottle. typical cheap, easy drinking lager smell and taste. nothing fancy but i think that’s the idea here. i can kind of see why they add a lime to this beer as it helps offset the somewhat “cheaper” beer flavor with some citrusy zest. decent mouthfeel though. it’s got some bubbly carbonation and crispness to it. it’s not a half bad thirst quencher on a hot day. personally, i’d take modelo or pacifico over this.",3.5
Corona Extra,"Poured into a pils glass from a 24oz can best by December 2022

On the pour a decent head forms then immediately dissipates entirely. Body is a golden yellow with average carbonation, crystal clear.

Aroma is skunked, even in the can. I wonder if getting the beer lightstruck is part of the process. It still has some detectable not ruined hops but even so there is some cheap lager aroma here as well. Not bad but not great. Some vague sweet malts are detectable under everything else going on.

Flavor is quite similar to the smell, but with less lager flavor although retaining the skunkiness. Some hop bitterness is there but the skunk is present the whole time. A corny light and sweet malt finish does come eventually after a weird tartness subsides, no wonder people drink this with lime.

Feel is easy drinking crisp and very highly carbonated. Quite light but has a surprisingly long finish that is actually pleasant.

Overall this is a pretty flavorful lawnmower beer that still feels light. Hops are present unlike a lot of beers in the category but there's also a lot off about it. Nothing disgusting as I think a lot of it is intentional but I've had better.",3.0

Taste is fairly mild, but dominated by the yeasty funk. Grassiness follows, then maybe a little grainy sweetness. A surprising bitterness builds, and I get a little lemon zest.

I really can't taste the difference. If you are a Miller Light fan and want to not get drunk, I think you'd rate this beer a 5. Seriously. It tastes better than Busch Light.

Maybe there should be an NA section on Beer Advocate where we rate NAs next to their alcohol equivalent. Then this is hands down a 5.

Only a hint of ""beer"" smell. Taste is fairly nuetral at first with a huge corny buttery aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, well carbonated and ruined by the unchecked vegetable oil finish.

Busch NA,"Is this fair?: Rating a non-alcoholic Anheuser-Busch beverage. The bar starts low. That's to the product's benefit. A friend asked me to try this, so here I am. And besides, maybe I want to go NA sometimes.

Smell: Ahh, that Anheuser-Busch aroma. It portends bad flavors approaching the palate. I've smelled worse, so I'm going with 2.0.

Taste: With the bar set so low, I'm struck by the fact that it isn't the worst beer I've had. I'm trying to envision a scenario where I would like this. It would have to involve a hot day, thirst and some sweaty work. Then again, I'd probably be looking for some alcohol. But not if I were operating a chainsaw on a hot day. Let's go with that. Under such circumstances, I might be grateful enough to rate this beer 2.0. Right now, the sharp taste of straw and overall underwhelming flavor move it more to a 1.75. To its credit, it doesn't hold much of an aftertaste.

Feel: Thin, light, slightly effervescent. That's kind of what you'd expect from a beer of this nature. For what it is, I'm going with 2.25.

Overall: Not as bad as I thought. If I needed a non-alcoholic beer, this was all I had, and it was very hot, then I'd take it. A rating of 2.0 isn't as bad as it could be. But you don't put high demands on a beer like this.",2.0

Smell is pretty non-existant to my nose, little bit of fruit/ lemon. Not bad, not great.

Taste is syrupy and sweet, with more lemon-y flavours and a bitterness that creeps up as you swallow. Not really complex, but not terrible. No sight of those ""Finest German Aromatic Hops"" though, more just bitterness without flavour. Honestly, I don't hate it. Could be more complex or backed up with hops but besides being a bit cloyingly sweet it really is not bad.

Mouth feel is syrupy, kind of thick because of the sweetness. Not dry, although there is bitterness which develops on the finish.

Overall - I don't hate it like a lot of people on here. Is it excellent, highbrow beer? No. But for what it is, it honestly isn't terrible. Not too much liquor forward in my opinion, tastes strong but not 10%. I would like some more hops and flavour besides the sweetness, some orange or grapefruit would balance that... Not great, but not terrible. If you want a buzz for cheap, go for it. And it's better than the average American piss-in-a-can any day.",3.0

Attention commercial brewers: It is much easier and less expensive to brew a high alcohol ale that tastes great than to attempt the same with a lager. Why are you not pursuing this?

Crest Super Premium Lager,"500ml can, a sort of surprise new offering from the Wells & Young's group to suddenly show up here in Alberta (for the second time, it would appear!). The ‘finest German aroma hops’, eh? WTF? Was this actually made in the country that originated the English language?

This beer pours a clear, bright medium golden amber colour, with two chubby fingers of puffy, rocky, and bubbly eggshell white head, which leaves some splendid bonsai tree forest lace around the glass as it quickly abates.

It smells of sickly sweet apples and pears, gritty caramel malt, yeasty rising bread, lemon furniture polish, and some strangely stanky, um, strange (ok, hops, I suppose, but man are they musky). The taste is gritty and grainy caramel, well, ‘flavouring’, dead yeast cells, pome fruit-heavy Yuk-a-Flux, further near gag-inducing industrial alcohol warming notes, and a distinct lack of the finest of German hops never to be seen in a shit show like this.

The bubbles are quite underwhelming in their barely perceptible frothiness, the body a so-so middleweight, as if buoyed by some unfamiliar sugar source, and not really all that smooth, not with that pithy, cheap-ass booziness loafing about. It finishes still pretty sweet, but all tainted here, and musty and dead-seeming there. Gah.

Yeah, this is not a craft brew, by any stretch of the imagination, which is a bit of a shame, given the predilections of the parent brewing concern (Courage, Bombardier, etc), but it is a party-starter (or ender, depending on one's constitution, I presume) - Euro malt liquor swill, incarnate. Oh, and I have to apologize for my opening generalizing tirade about the English - we have shitty, supposedly educated marketing people over here too.",2.0
Crest Super Premium Lager,"Well it's fairly rank stuff. But lets be honest. You buy this to get a buzz on the cheap. I've been there, and I will say you could do worse.

Crest Super Premium Lager,"500 mL can picked up at TBS; best before June 19 2016 and served ice cold. This is a beer that I have intentionally avoided for nearly 10 years now, but I was feeling masochistic tonight.

Pours a clear golden colour, capped off with one inch of frothy white head. It seeps away steadily over the next five minutes or so, eventually thinning out into a foamy cap and collar. Good lacing, too - visually this is a rather attractive lager, but aromatically I'd have to argue otherwise. Corn syrup, alcohol, wet cardboard, boiled vegetables and apples all come to mind, but ""quality lager"" most certainly does not. To quote a certain fictitious news anchor, I immediately regret this decision.

Not quite as awful as I'd anticipated, but still one of the worst beers I've had in years. Very saccharine, with flavours of corn syrup and cotton candy dominating at first. This is, surprisingly enough, countered by some weedy, grassy hop extract bitterness, but the truly off-putting aftertaste totally blots out that faint beam of light. Little effort has gone into masking the alcohol content, which is noticeable throughout the sip - but it really reaches its climax after you swallow a gulp. At that point, this beer begins to taste the way that compost water and paint thinner smell. Light-medium in body, with appropriately assertive carbonation levels. The alcohol burn is so significant that it almost seems to have a numbing effect on the tongue.

Final Grade: 1.98, a miserable F. Crest Super Premium Lager is more of a fraternity hazing supply or a solvent than a beer. In fact, it is easily one of the worst alcoholic beverages that I can recall consuming over the past decade - and consume I did, all the way to the bottom of the can, because I'm just that stubborn. Crest is shamelessly boozy, and I would judge no man or woman for pouring this swill down the drain.

Crest Super Premium Lager,"Obtained from a local 'Bargin Booze' outlet, just for joke: I was determinded to dislike it and had a bias preconception formed from trying other high alcohol canned lagers in the UK.

However, I liked the damn thing!

Wonderfully sunny day, and I was knackered after grafting all week: sat in the back garden I remembered this beer and thought I'd give it a go. Poured into Budweiser Budvar stemmed tulip.

Lovely snow white head on top of a crystal clear golden, bright lager. Looked almost identical to the wifes Carlsberg Export, except the Carlsberg had next to no head.

Alcohol esters in an otherwise odourless lager/pilsner type non-smell, I give a score of 3 for smell-less lagers/pilsners.

The actual taste reminded me of a Brigand Belgian Ale, with the alcohol being a little more prominent in this beer.

I also expected a nasty metalic headache type feel to the aftertaste, this didn't happen and I was pleasantly suprised by the beer in general. Sure it had too much alcohol for my tastes, but it told me that on the tin. This a lot better than many in this class or style, honest.",3.5
Crest Super Premium Lager,"I imagine few people that drink Crest see the poorly bubbled, clear (but tarnished) golden liquid that lies beyond the steely, navy blue walls of the can (or the brown of the paper bag, for that matter). Should they, however, they won't note anything too different; while it may look pedestrian, and give no indication of the fact that it's the worst beer I've tried, it's definitely something I'd suggest the city's sanitation committee have a look at.

Crest smells like a cesspool of festering corn and alcohol fumes; the first thing that came to mind was a biological contamination site. I'm confused that they've used both hops and hop extract - ain't nothing standing in the way of this repulsive, excessive, cloying, synthetic sweetness. Then again, they also used both corn and corn syrup.

'Oh dear mother of God' - was what came out of my mouth after taking the first sip. The second thing was a fit of dry heaves. It's like they took stale corn kernels, coated them in corn syrup and drenched them in sugar. By the fourth sip it starts to feel like an Inquisition-type form of punishment. There's no way I'll make it through the whole can.

Anything with this much flagrant alcohol can easily upset even those with a cast iron stomach; warm discount-brand vodka is less offensive. 500ml can? Seriously? I could do a shot or two, max, if forced to. It has enough strong, synthetic, fusel quality to strip rust; kidding aside, it could honestly be confused with some of the products under your sink.

I not only appreciate all styles of beer, but genuinely like each and every one of them as well... with the exception of value-brand so-called malt-liquors which, as Crest Super confirms, I'm not too modest to admit, I believe are beneath me. I'm proud to say that I've tried very, very few malt-liquors, but Crest is far and away the most horrible.

Crest Super is super disgusting. The feeling of revulsion actually drinking it far, far exceeds the feeling of embarrassment I had buying the can. Beginning this review I had every intention of poking fun at the destitute, down-and-out types that make up Crest's only demographic - now I just feel sorry for them. In all seriousness, this beer - for all its flagrant, stomach-wrenching alcohol - is actually a very sobering experience.",1.0
Crest Super Premium Lager,"500 ml poured in a chilled pint glass...

Appearance - Crest pours very light with a white foamy head. Carbonation is fairly good, u can really hear it when you pour. The head is minimal and leads to some ok lacing. Colour is a light gold and very clean.

Smell - for a 10% beer you cant really smell the alcohol, the hops and a sweetness smell come through quite well.

Taste - UGGGG - one of the worse things i have ever put in my mouth! What a taste, there are no words that can over come the bitterness of this beer. I did not enjoy this beer a lick, kind of not looking fwd to the mouthfeel. If there was a 0.0 rating i would give it!

Mouthfeel - At this stage of the review, i am almost in tears cause its so bad. The mouthfeel has barring on the overall bitterness, i had a hard time keeping it my mouth for the duration of the tasting.

Budweiser,"Budweiser is a solid American lager. For what it is - a crisp, light, simple beer, it’s excellent. The consistency of their production is obviously incredible, and in the right setting (a hot summer day, or in the evening in a buzzing pub while watching the game) there are few things that can stand up to this classic. It’s best enjoyed cold and fresh, with its natural carbonation and mild beechwood finish and glorious light gold color and mild head. Folks complaining that it’s not like their good ol’ German beer or hazy mega-juice buttsmacker IPA aren’t wrong that it’s not a beer with a heavy body or distinct taste palate. But that’s missing the point of this beer completely. I’ve always got a fresh pack in the garage fridge.",4.0
Budweiser,"I found a bottle of Budweiser in somebody's refrigerator.
Look: Budweiser had significant foam from what I could see.
Smell: Budwieser had the hazy pungent aroma of corn mixed with industrial chemicals.

Budweiser,"Last beer I reviewed was an exquisite, delicate Pilsner that paired insanely well with a good pizza. The boys over at Weihenstephaner sure know how to do the right balance of complex and nuanced flavors, along with a nice delicate, simple beer that is worthy of their brand.

With my reviews, I've mostly been doing beers I love or like, so my reviews are skewed in that way, but today I review a beer that I feel isn't all that great, and that's Anheuser-Busch's beer, Budweiser.

COLOR:

Light and clear golden color. It does look pretty good when poured right. The head fizzles out and dies though, which should be an indication of what I should expect.

AROMA:

Smells tart and cheap. I got a weird, funky skunk smell. Just smells bad.

BODY AND PALATE:

It has the memory of a lager. All of the classic flavors are there, they're just incredibly thinned out. This tastes as if you wanted a beer and somebody shouted the classic lager flavor profile from another room. It tastes cheap.

Add some corn syrup taste and feel to this and you basically have a Budweiser. I love me a good Pilsner and a nice, refreshing lager, but this is definitely not the King of the Beers. More like a serf.

FINISH:

The finish isn't too bad, and not out of the ordinary for a typical lager finish. And I guess that's sorta the problem, isn't it? Nothing really stands out and intrigues your palate.

CONCLUSION:

This is nothing but dorm room beer. It's cheap, it's readily available, and for playing drinking games it has its place. But now that I'm 32 years old, I'm not after quantity, I want a nice, quality beer, and this beer just tastes like water to me.

This beer basically took those classic and delicate flavors of pale lagers and Pilsners that people love, and thinned them out, because they're after mass production and not a nice, refreshing, quality beer at the end of the day.

Overall, it gets a 2.5/10 for me. It tastes like the MEMORY of a lager or Pilsner, and is only good if you've just reached drinking age, you don't have a lot of money, and all you give a shit about is getting shit-hammered.",1.75
Budweiser,"""Best by 10/6/22""; drank 7/8/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dull orange/yellow appearance.

An even pour yielded a nice off-white head; strong, frothy lace.

Sweet corn, fresh bread & faint strawberry (?!) notes in the nose.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Fresh bread, mild raspberry & faint caramel flavors.

Budweiser,"It’s hot dogs and brats on the grill, fireworks and a Bud!

I assume I’ve had a Bud before, but the last time was at least 40 years ago (probably longer). And I have no specific memory of it amongst a sea of similar beers.

The 4th of July seemed to me to be as good a time as any to give it a proper tasting.

I reduced the temp of my smaller beer ‘fridge specifically for this beer. The ‘fridge was at about 38°F when I removed the beer. The beer was at about 40° when I started tasting.

Clear, pale yellow, lightly carbonated body topped with a tall white head, thick and creamy-looking with retention on the short side of moderate. Nice looking for the style.

Pleasant, if weak, aroma. Malty with hints of sweetness. No complexity, but still nice.

Light flavor of malts. Smooth in the beginning, and remaining such throughout. Some (but very little) bittering appears in the late middle and carries through to the finish. As with the aroma, no complexity, but still enjoyable. The aftertaste is mild and lightly malty with slight bittering. The overall taste is just a little on the sweet side. The finish and aftertaste are more malty than crisp, ending, again, just on the sweet side. (The slight sweetness of Budweiser is apparently one of the differentiating factors – according to other reviews – from the other top-selling AALs, but I like it.)

The mouth feel is thin, decent carbonation feel, and surprisingly creamy (in a light sort of way).

Overall, I am surprised that I am enjoying this beer as much as I am. In flavor and in body, it certainly beats the heck out of the plethora of light/Lite® brands from these macro brewers.

One additional comment: unlike some other macro lagers – and even some non-macro lighter lagers, this beer does not develop off-flavors as it warms. It remains pretty much as it started.

NB: The following rating is with style in mind, but it also is a fair reflection of my enjoyment of this beer. Imagine that. I think I'll crack a second!",3.5
Budweiser,"Bud was the very first beer my friend gave me, years ago. It was warm and probably past it’s expiration. I didn’t even finish it before throwing up. Didn’t drink beer again for over a decade and a half. Now I know what I like and enjoy exploring different beers and saw the tall-boy cans of Budweiser for sale on the 4th of July with the word “FREEDOM” inscribed on the front. I decided I should revisit this for the sake of knowing what it actually tastes like. Surprise! -it’s not as horrible as the beer aficionados claim. Neutral flavor of very mild hops, malt, and sweetness from the rice. No off-putting flavors or aftertaste. Clean and refreshing. It’s not something that one drinks to contemplate life’s mysteries, but maybe just to stare into a camp fire or watch the stars. It’s good enough to cool you from the heat of your bbq grill. I will say that I had some *ahem* bathroom problems later that I can’t help but attribute to this beer… but overall I cannot bring myself to look down on Budweiser any longer.",3.75
Budweiser,"Picked up a case of bud cans today. Maybe it’s the special summer “freedom” marketing that gets me, I don’t know. This beer pours perfectly, golden with a glorious white head.

Budweiser,"Poured from a 16oz can into my weizen glass. Best before 5-14-22

On the pour a giant head forms even on an average pour 3 plus fingers but it quickly recedes to just a ring of larger bubbles around the rim and a few pods of bubbles floating on top

Aroma is tart and largely smells of cheap lager. Some BO notes not great and not a lot of malt either just off. And this is still a month before the best before. Bad.

Taste follows the smell but brings notes of corn. Still mostly tart water fermentation character. Some buscuity malt aftertaste but that fades to the taste of popcorn kernels. No bitterness, just fermentation, BO and grain. Still not a lot of flavor though.

Feel is crisp and easy to put down with a lot of carbonation bite for the style this is perfectly acceptable. Not overly watery on the sip but it doesn't stick around long. Not the best.

Overall perfectly drinkable and pretty predictable. Seems like it moves quick everywhere so it's not too risky if you can deal with the standard off flavors. Certainly not a standout, and I wouldn't reccomend pouring this in a glass.",2.75
Budweiser,"Well, it’s Bud. Not going to do a classic review here because it’s not that type of beer, but just write out some thoughts.

Syrupy taste with that classic, macro malt liquor skunkiness that has that weird savoury oily character. A little bit of bready character, a bitterness that is more metallic twang than hoppy, and you have a classic adjunct lager.

I am neither a proponent nor hater of this beer. I think snobs will always despise any macro lager and sometimes even the people who drink it. On the other side, people love to say ‘dude for a lawn mowing beer it’s what you want dude’ (not sure how lawnmowing became that de-facto go to for this) but I tend to be unpersuaded by that. For the price, while it is cheaper than some craft and ‘craft-macros’, you can find absolutely comparable priced beer that doesn’t taste terrible. In any style as well, lager, Pilsner, IPA, even German styles. Unsurprising with how tight the market is, plenty of beers without any adjuncts at all are out there for the same price.

So, if you like Budweiser, just say ‘Hey, I like this’. Who cares? You can enjoy any beer without needing to justify it, really. I was slightly surprised drinking this that it wasn’t as bad as some have described, and it’s not exactly unpleasant. The syrupy skunky character gives a taste in the mouth sort of like slightly pungent, off tasting cheese, but that’s about the worst of it. Though I am always surprised I tend to be like +10 to +20% on these ratings for the ‘bad beers’. I don’t think Bud outright fails which would put it below a 2.5 for any of the rankings, but hey. Like I said earlier — a preference is a preference and it’s okay to enjoy or dislike something!",2.5

Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach,"From the 12 fl. oz. twist-off with a marking of 1167-2910629A. Sampled on March 9, 2013.

Remember to rate it on style not on reputation.

It poured pale yellow with a quick excited burst of fizzy carbonation leading to a head that fizzles quickly. So place it at average.

The aroma is full of peach esters like announced but there is a vague bready and clean hop note lingering behind it all. So a little above average.

The body is light with a slight acidity probably due to the peach zing. So a tad above average.

The taste is peached up to the max at first but there is an odd sort of lingering finish which could be due to the hops or the fruit. I will put it at average.

There are a bunch of these Michelob Ultra fruit beers out there and this one is slightly more appealing than the others I have had. But it is still a hot summer day kind of beer.",3.0
Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach,"I picked up a bottle of this and shared with my wife, enjoyed chilled a goblet.

the color is pale golden with thin band of white beads and moderately fast moving carbonation. The smell is very sweet and peachy with a light tropical candy odor which I suppose is dragonfruit-esque but the aroma is more fuzzy navel smelling in general. Light feel, ultra light fizzy and seltzer-like.

The flavor is similar to the scent with some tangy fruitiness and sweet essence with mild tropical juice like cooler quality with mild spritzer-like taste in comparision to other fruit lagers I guess. Overall not terrible especially if you are rating it for what it is and not a simple light lager. I would probably not buy this but it certainly fits the label and was not dissapointing when paired with sushi and wasabi. I would say poor if you are looking for a true beer, but not bad if you want a malternative.",3.75
Boxer Lager,"Not to objective because it is my favorite lager and costs less than a buck for 24 ounces.

It has a cara-pils malt taste that harkens to the beers they made at that brewery since I started drinking. Some comments attribute it to yeast...which makes some sense because you couldn't afford expensive malt at that price.

Most younger ""serious"" beer drinkers are sucking down heavy hopped beers. If your looking for your beer to taste like high gravity bitters or grapefruit you will need to spend more money.

This beer is distinctive and produced in relatively tiny batches. At the price there is no comparison.

It reminds me a bit of beer from India.",5.0

As it is, this is a cheap, easily drinkable beer with a wonderful mouthfeel and a nutmeg, Hefeweizen taste.

Not my first choice. But an OK choice.

Pretty typical. However, there is something else going on here: there are unmistakable notes of hefeweizen yeast, which contribute aromas and flavors of banana and clove.

12 fl. oz. can, production coded but without freshness dating

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's clear but not as clear as I thought it would be, I can't see my finger prints through the glass, nor are my fingers really that clear. Odd. The initial finger-thick head of bright white that rose up over the fairly deep golden body is now already gone but there are some splashes of lacing left behind. The aroma is sweetish and dare I say malty? It's not grainy, and it's clear that there's some adjunct in use, but there is some maltiness to it. There's also, unfortunately, some esters that I connect with higher fermentation... not good. The flavor follows, and again, it's surprisingly malty, and sweetish like wort. I don't detect any specific oxidation like a papery characteristic, but it could be that some initial oxidation is making it seem more malty. Just a theory. It's medium bodied and crisp. I didn't find any hops in the aroma, nor do I find any in the flavor except for a touch of an herbal and leafy note in the finish. It's background though and that higher alcohol ester thing is still there and distracting. This is obviously not well made, but it's cheap - although there are many better made budget beers on the market that cost less. Disappointing.

Boxer Lager,"Poured from 24 oz. can into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a very nice golden amber color with tons of tiny bubbles streaming up through the brew and producing a two finger head of white foam. The head has a modest level of retention, fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of sweeter smells of caramel and a decent showing of corn syrup. Along with these aromas comes a decent amount of a metallic smell.

Taste – The taste begins with a mix of a bready, light caramel, and corn cereal taste mixed with a bit of a metallic flavor. The metallic flavor gets stronger in nature as the taste advances all while the bready and the corn fade a bit. All the while a bit of a cardboard flavor develops and with a loss much of the caramel, one is left with a somewhat off metallic and cardboard corny taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of eh brew is on the slightly thicker side (for a 5 % adjunct lager) with a carbonation level that was average. A little thinner body may have been slightly better for the mix of caramel and corn upfront and may have downplayed some of the off flavors slightly better. Overall the feel was not all that bad though

Overall – Not the tastiest of brews, but for the cheap price it is actually a decent go too. A good party brew.",3.0

As a woman now, I favor Heineken Lights. For over 7 years now its my go to. I remember having friends give me toilet beer like STEEL RESERVE. LORD help me. No, help them. I remember visiting this friend, I was drunk before noon. I knew my dear friend was REALLY having life issues. It was like drinking straight chemicals. I was the one who had to pick up our children...mines...his... hers...from school. Smelling like a damn can redemption. Damn embarrassing. I am a woman who does not like flavors in my beer.

L: polished-clear, slightly pale gold colored liquid; tight, frothy, fleeting off-white cap - foam looks like it would hold, but it settles into thin cap, then thin collar; only a little slits of lace

S: initial whiff of classic Heine' skank; mineral-y, dried flowers, grassy undertone, with an almost pizza crusty malt base under it all... something odd, something missing, as if the malt aromas have been drained of malt... fair intensity overall

T: extra dry, doughy, lightly-toasted, crackery grain in essence upon first sip (with a little more suds to carry the flavors)... first big sip reveals an underwhelming, brown-paper-bag dullness to the edges of the malt foundation... the dryness in its finish is rather dead-on ideal for its ilk; mute expression all-around, though it almost has a helles-like aftertaste creep in late

F: delicate sizzle with each sip; certain mellow plushness; light-bodied, but not thin... aside from a subtle residual chew on the palate, it doesn't feel much like beer has passed through

Heineken Premium Light Lager,"16oz can poured into Duvel tulip. BBD FEB-2020 printed on bottom of can. So this still has up to 8 months of freshness left in it. Picked it up at the grocery store in a 4 pack for $6.

Appearance - Pours large offwhite semi-loose head with good retention, patchy lacing and decent to low stick. Crystal clear medium gold body. 4

Smell - The graininess you'd except from a euro lager, but a little fainter than normal. 3.5

Taste - Heineken plus water? Did I figure it out? Bland. But I mean, that's what you get what you're asking for. No real off characters. 2.5

Mouthfeel - Thin, watery, clean. I guess even refreshing, though without the effervescence you'd normally associate with that word. 2.5

Overall - It's damn near water, but again, you're getting exactly what you're asking for when you get a beer with the variation ""light"" slapped across the label. No real off characters to speak of.

Heineken Premium Light Lager,"The nose brings citrus and grass to mind, while the malt profile is very hard to make out. The taste is very clean and inoffensive. While the attack distantly reminds of hay and grain, it is otherwise devoid of any malt character, and the center is formed by distant echoes of hops with just a faint hint of a shadow of bitterness, leading up to a mostly clean finish with a hint of grain. The body is lean and feels as though it has been diluted with water. There's nothing off with the brew, but it sure is bland.",3.5
Heineken Premium Light Lager,"12 Oz bottle poured into glass
Look - similar to an adjunct lager, very clear, pale straw color, some foam and some glass lacing
Smell - aroma of various herbs and earth grains. Some sour, some bitter. Very unique yeast.
Taste - Extremely light, almost water-like and some flavor but nothing too crazy. Essentially tastes like a watered down Heineken. Lots of white bread and paleness. Carbonation is only medium which is good. Could probably drink this all night its so smooth and crisp and light.

Overall, if you are going to drink Heineken out of a bottle, make sure it has been packed well without any light access or you risky drinking skunk. If its not skunked i find it very enjoyable although this light version is too light for me on most occasions. I give it a grade of B",3.75

Heineken Premium Light Lager,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 5/2/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.3%. Overall this is a nice light lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Nicely flavorful and not watery for the ABV. No skunk at all surprisingly. Clean pils malts and nice earthy hop presence for the style. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example.

Pale Ale,"Crystal clear color of light gold. Brief one-finger head. Absolutely zero lacing on the glass.

The smell is dry malt with a caramel touch. There's a bit of cardboard to the nose as well.

High carbonation level with not enough body to balance it. Despite this, this beer is too sweet, cloy even. There are overtones of apricot and caramel, but it isn't appealing--too dessert like. The hop is nearly nonexistent which is unfortunate since this beer needs balance. Think double bock without the body or rich malt presence. A clear miss.",2.25

My god! How can a beer that looks, smells, and feels so decent have such an off-putting flavor? The flavor is nothing like a pale ale and instead presents an amped version of a bad mix of grapefruit and lime juice. Out of whack (taste-wise) and extremely forgettable unless you just want to look at it...",1.0
Pale Ale,"Gluten-free beer....totally pointless. But I picked up a bottle anyway.

Poured into a handy teku glass, a darker amber color, with a thin bubbly white head that held as a small ringlet. Nose was mostly subdued, hints of herbal hops and sugary sweetness. In the taste, up front, there was a light flavor of herbal hops, like dried leaves, with a big wave of candy-like sweetness coming in soon after, and lingering into the aftertaste. Tasted more like beer-flavored seltzer. Mouthfeel was thin, body was light-medium.

Gluten sensitivity has pretty much been proven a myth except for the small amount of people with that disease/disorder, so there's really only a small number of people who would actually need a gluten-free beer. Hopefully there's one out there somewhere that tastes good to help out those people that actually want to enjoy the craft beer scene.",2014.0
Pale Ale,"I had purchased this a while back, thinking that perhaps an article on gluten-free beers might be in the offing. When I could not find a taker, the beers got shunted to the side. I had a colleague who has issues with gluten and she was always curious about beers that were gluten-free. I usually eschew them since I am not gluten-intolerant and prefer to leave them for people who are. In the interim, I am purging my massive backlog of bottles this summer and lo and behold! this one popped up. They will now be part of The Great Bottle Purge of the Summer of 2014.

From the bottle: ""Ale made from sorghum and brown rice extract""; ""new Palnet Beer chooses to support organizations that help our planet.""

I am being driven nuts by these gluten-free beers! I realize that I am not their intended audience since I do not have Celiac, but they just make me feel like drinking a beer after I drink one. My easy-going pour still created a LOT of foam, so I sat back to let it do its thing. It burped, fizzled, off-gassed and generally acted like a baby, except that I have encountered better-behaved babies. It finally settled into a brief finger of rocky, tawny head that was determined to fizzle into wisps. Color was a tea-like deep amber/light copper to copper (SRM = &gt; 13, &lt; 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a flowery, perfume-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium. There was no question that this beer contained sorghum once I got some in my mouth. Man, but it imparts a really sharp tartness that might appeal to some people, but for me, it was just not what I want to taste in a beer. I find it kind of difficult to describe, but it is like a diluted molasses with apple vinegar. Woof! Finish was dry, tart, not much unlike other gluten-free beers, but just not my bag.",2.75
Pale Ale,"This looks like a decent glass of beer with a slightly dark, coppery coloring and a decent head. That is where the positives end unfortunately. The taste is metallic, artificial and incredibly unlike how a beer should taste. It is also proceed like a premium beer which adds insult to injury. If I were gluten free I would gladly give up beer if this were my only choice. Fortunately there are others like Omission IPA that, while not fantastic, are palatable.",1.0

Black Label Beer,"Pours a pale golden-straw in color, and as clear as can be.

Not much to go on in the nose or aroma segment. It’s inoffensive, neutral and “clean”, with malt character dominating the (very low in character, anyway) corn syrup. No hop presence whatsoever.

Light and somewhat crisp on the first sip. Sweetish. As with the nose, an inoffensive character, with little in the way of malt depth by which anyone might find interest or something to engage in, or even to recommend to another lover of characterful lager, real ale, or Craft Beer. Finish using the dry side, for what it’s worth.

“Boring and inoffensive” is not the sort of phrase I’d use to recommend a beer to anyone else, but in the right circumstances that’s exactly the sort of beer that’s called for, and Black Label fits the bill most of the time.

And it’s cheap, too! Well, a quarter or more higher in price than the lowliest of the low in the malt liquor category (211), but when you’re on a budget and want a brand to relax with but not get crunk on, this is a go-to — if you can even find it.*

Not recommended for people who have little sense of humor in an increasingly absurd world. For the fact is, with Taprooms opening on every block in every major city, it won’t be long before retailers will refuse to stock rubbish such as this, owing to the fact that there’s so much local Craft Beer in cans nowadays. Rejoice, motherxxxxxxx!

* (For some reason it’s got a presence in cold boxes in Minneapolis and Saint
Paul, which was not one of its original markets back when Carling and later Carling-National moved down from Canada to become a big player in the brewing industry in the U.S.A. The glory days of Mabel! But I digress.

At any rate, the market presence is probably due more to the consolidation of brands and brand swapping that went on when Heileman closed and Pabst and Miller split up some of the available brands.)",3.0

The first one I entered the other day was scaring me pricewise so I went (relatively) cheap and came home with a twelver of this unknown entity.

Pours super light colored, with very aggressive carbonation and a thin cap. Nose is light sweet malt. Inoffensive but uninspiring. Taste is a little corny but it's not significantly worse than standbys like PBR or Natty Boh. Aftertaste is reasonably clean.

Old Milwaukee Beer,"I think this may be the palest lager I've had yet. It's notably lighter in color than the ripe hay you usually get from a beer of this style. Thin streams of CO2 support a cloudy, bone white head with surprisingly good retention.
Old Miilwaukee's aroma starts off dryer than I expected. Aromas of soda cracker and fresh baked biscuits come through in the front. Just the barest hint of earthiness gives the nose a little depth. Coming through in the center, I catch a whiff of creamed corn, announcing the predictable presence of adjunct. The finish gives me a brief note of generic, leafy hops before fading into the distance.
Initial impression is of a smooth, rounded, refreshing profile. Slight flavors of cereal grain in the beginning. The mouthfeel definitely builds towards the rounded sort of center that can be a good thing in a refreshing lager. Sadly though, this is where flavors of corn adjunct come through. Adjuncts are accompanied by flavors of sulfur that are a little more present than they should be. Finish is dry and grassy.
Old Milwaukee has the same corn, sulfur, and adjunct flavors of so many mainstream lagers. If it weren't for these same issues, beers like Old Milwaukee might be bordering on decent beer.",2.5

But, the first thing I thought when I tasted Old Milwaukee is: ""they're using hops, not extract."" I looked it up--the page I saw said that they use two varieties of hops. The taste was a tiny bit more like a premium than I expected, and I appreciated that. Consider this a gentle nudge while something like Beck's is a slap in the face.

F: soft, plush flow, delicate sudsy finish; clean dry finish, but very subtle residual drag... shapeless body

O: got a sweet deal on a 2-pk sale, cut from a sixer - could not pass up (they also had OM Ice for same deal, should've got them too, but I'll go back)... fairly textbook; the lean toward bready rather than doughy was notable, perhaps the wide mouth of the mug played into it? (1513)",3.75
Old Milwaukee Beer,"There's a taste to this beer that I cant recognize in any other macro lager, or even craft beer for that matter. It tastes like a corn adjunct with a mild roastiness to it.

Or it might not be that at all.

It was all down hill from there.

Desperados,"The first words out of my mouth were, ""holy shiznit, what were they thinking?"" Or words to that effect.

Sugar, buttered toast, sugar, and more sugar on the nose. Mouthfeel is not insubstantial, but nothing special. Tastes like someone mixed Budweiser with Sprite, added a few drops of tequila, and a feckton of sugar. I had to add some Guinness to make it palatable—and even then I couldn't finish it.

Wouldn't diss on this beer too much, even though I wouldn't say it's recommended. Overall quality is definitely poor-ish but still could drink this casually. I don't think there is any problem with this as a ""soda"" drink. As a beer it indeed is poor, or almost worthless in that sense.

Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades very fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heavy of a corn syrup sweetness mixed with aromas of a dusty dankness as well as a metallic smell. With a touch of cardboard, the aroma is overall not the most enticing.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweet corn syrup and caramel taste mixed with a touch of grain and a decently strong paper taste. As the taste advances some light mustiness and more paper, as well as some metallic tastes comes to the tongue, leaving one with a metallic and sweet malt liquor taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. For the style and the more off tastes the feel is good, as it minimizes the impact of the flavors on the tongue to its greatest extent.
Overall – Not the best malt out there for sure…",2.25

The taste makes my face involuntarily twinges at the taste. This is bad - even for the style. Raw alcohol with an odd sweetness that is tough to describe.

This is harsh - It says ""smooth"", but don't believe it.

This is for people who want a quick buzz at a cheap price. I somehow made it through the whole can, but never again. There are better malt liquors out there. This is one of the worst beers I've ever had. I don't recommend it, even to alcoholics looking for a cheap high abv brew.",1.5

Reviewed as: American Malt Liquor
Misc.: No canned on date; Can reads 9.9 pct. ABV

Recently was dared to review a King Cobra. Actually did not know that Malt Liquor was reviewable on Beer Advocate. Once I looked it up and saw I was, had to go with it. Once I saw that there were seven (seven!) (EDIT: now eight (eight!)) other Malt Liquors at the next-door market, made it a point to review one each Tuesday until I run out. Typically am against all the big boy beers, but I am breaking that rule for this challenge. Eighth up was Stack (High Gravity). Apparently it was brewed by United Brands in Lacrosse, Wis., and under special agreement in Memphis, Tenn. Can read “Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager is brewed with the finest extra malted barley and select hops for a bold yet exceptionally smooth taste. Stack 101 Smooth Lager is the first introductory brew style by Stack Brewing Company. Stack beer is brewed with superior ingredients for big, bold and smooth flavor.” A quick look at Beer Advocate and it had it at 2.13. Whoa. That meant it was only better than King Cobra and Old English 800. Going in I had it E40, Mickey’s, Hurricane, Steele Reserve 211, Natty Daddy, Old English 800 and King Cobra with the latter three pretty far back.

Poured a straw clear color with two fingers of off-white fizzy head. Lots of fast moving bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Decent spotty lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.25)

Smelled kind of a mess initially like a bunch of flavors trying to get out of the can. Got red apple, sweet corn syrup, scrambled eggs, skunk, light strawberry, pear and buttered sourdough bread. Not smelling too boozy. (Smell - 2.75)

Usually the first taste of American Malt Liquors for me are not terrible, but the second one can be all over the place (usually much, much worse). However, this may have been the worst first taste of the lot. Second taste was even worse, but not as bad as it could have been. Specifically got sweet corn syrup, buttered white bread, spoiled pear, green apple, white grape, hints of strawberry, boxed white wine, barley, wet grain, scrambled eggs and wet skunky fart. Did not taste 9.9 pct. (Taste - 2.25)

Medium body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt finish. Very unbalanced and tough to swallow. (Feel - 1.50)

Was kind of all over the place on a few categories here. Certainly wasn’t a fan. Would have it in the lower 1/3 of the Malt Liquors. (Overall - 2.25)

Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"This beer was listed as 9.9% not 12%.
Good looking pour for the style.
Smell is pretty boozy

Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"UBC LaCrosse WI and under special agreement Memphis TN on the can.

It pours a fairly dark yellow with a 1 finger head of foam with lots of bubble action.

Huge corn notes in the smell as well as some grain. It also smells the full 9.9% abv.

Corn first and foremost followed by some lemon twang that leans towards the tart side. Saying that it is rough tasting would almost be a compliment; smooth is mentioned a few times on the can.

The tartness intensifies as the beer warms and in a case like this, that is not a good thing.

Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"its cheap its 9.9% and its HORRIBLE
i like high gravity malt liquors but this is just bad , it was $1.65 but dont let that price point fool you
you can get much better for the same price.

its just so strong and full of corn like drinking bio diesel, its not super carbonated but it is bubbly
its reminds me of sunny delight , its so fake and full of artificial crap strong and syrupy .

this is so bad its so strong , i couldn't just drink it like a normal beer , i had to sip it like a wine , it took me a while to finish it.

i used to get 4 16 once for $1.99 at the center market and i used to be able to pound them like nothing and that was when it was 12% .
and after i had to drink this slowly because it was so bad i barly got a buzz . might as well of got a can of pbr...

this stuff is not good , i bought it to see if it was as bad as i remember and the can for the collection.

if you dont want to do either of this stay away , get old englishe ,hurricane, steel reserve, ice house edge or even natty daddy

anything is better than this even 4loco or other alco pop you can drown out the nasty with 7 up

i do not recommend stay away",1.25
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"I picked up a 24oz can at my local corner mart. Looks like a real winner. ABV is 9.9% per the label. ""Stack High Gravity Smooth Lager."" Reviewed as a malt liquor given its marketing, price point, and ingredients list. Served into a pilsner glass in Austin, Texas. Reviewed live. Expectations are extremely low.

Served cold - straight from the fridge. Side-poured gently as overcarbonation is anticipated.

A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.

Pours a predictable clear translucent yellow littered with abundant carbonation bubbles. It's got some nice vibrance and isn't weak looking like many malt liquors. No floating yeast particles/sediment is visible; it's quite clean. High transparency; you can read text through this beer.

The head is initially two fingers wide but recedes to a very thin layer atop the body inside one minute. Still, the retention is better than you'd expect for a budget range malt liquor at this high an ABV. Some limited spotty inconsistent lacing does cling to the sides of the glass after the head recedes.

Overall, it's an above average appearance for a malt liquor. I can't say I'm looking forward to trying it, but there aren't any egregious flaws.

Sm: Has a heavy malty and adjuncty sweetness. Loads of corn - mainly adjunct. Malt syrups/extract. Not as grainy as would be ideal. I also get some faint berry character - strawberry, I think. It's strange and artificial, but lends some needed complexity to an otherwise boring aroma. To its credit, there are no traces of the 9.9% ABV in the aroma. I also don't find any yeast character - or any really hop character - not even just a simple floral profile. The syrupy sweetness is off-putting, and I'm anticipating a sickly buttery texture, but this is far from the foulest malt liquor aroma I've come across.

Average strength.

T: The syrupy sweetness is certainly the core of the beer, but it isn't as offensive as anticipated. It's got some light graininess and could use more. Heavy corn adjunct is present alongside the aforementioned artificial strawberry note - which isn't doing the flavour profile any favors. I also get a cheap white wine character and some disgusting green apple notes. There's no real hop profile here.

To be fair, I will say that it hides its alcohol content pretty decently. But I can't say I like it; there's no complexity or subtlety here whatsoever. It's far from an intricate or gestalt build. Unbalanced as well.

Mf: Buttery, smooth, wet, and sticky. Overcarbonated as hell. Presence on the palate is abysmal; it's making me a bit ill. Has a bit too much weight, body and thickness for how little flavour there is; it's very filling. The texture doesn't seem well designed for this flavour profile. Execution is quite poor overall, but again I do think it's worth mentioning that it's not a hot or boozy brew, which is something of an accomplishment. That said, it's a pretty harsh mouthfeel overall.

Not astringent or gushed.

Dr: Not the worst malt liquor on the market, but far from the best. It's almost sickening, but I can't give it a lower rating than this because it isn't watery, and still tastes like beer. I'll be making a concerted effort to finish the entire can. It's not a sipper, but its low quality makes it tough to quaff and consuming it is making me feel terrible (especially in my stomach). ABV is hidden better than you'd expect. I wouldn't recommend this beer to anybody. Even just in this style and price range, there are better beers (and more widely available ones, for that matter). Stick to Steel Reserve for those nights when classy just doesn't cut it.

Reasonably atrocious.

D-",1.75
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"Poured from a 24 oz. can into a pint glass. Appearance is a medium heavy yellow with white foam that dissipates rather quickly and leaves minimal lacing.

Odor is slightly lemony with a sourness. Kind of like the odor of a cheap lemon furniture polish. No hop smell, just malt and the leftover lemon smell.

Taste is not like a lager, which it says to be, but more of a malt liquor. Not crisp like a good lager, but has a sour taste with a lot of alcohol. Not smooth at all. No bitterness like an IPA or Pale Ale. Can't hardly even taste the malt.

Doesn't leave much on the palette. The front and sides of the tongue are somewhat in rebellion, but doesn't leave much mouthfeel one way or another.

So far, of the Malt Beverages I've tried this is the worst. On the positive side, if you are looking to get blind stupid drunk, you could ask for a better beer. Two of these would do it, but you would really be better off buying some cheap wine. This is the kind of beer you would use a brown paper back instead of a coozy. I may finish half of the glass I poured, but the rest of the glass and the can is going to be poured down the drain. I don't think the brewer was aiming to win any medals on this one, but just something cheap that you could get a buzz from and with this the brewer has succeeded.",1.5
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"I am comparing Stack against other malt liquors of it's type - high gravity ""lagers."" As such, it is one of the best in the pack -- highly alcoholic, cheap and drinkable. Compared to larger brands such as Colt 45 or Schlitz this is a much better experience. It's obviously not a good beer in comparison to all beers on the market, but it's a great cheap malt liquor.

It's not as smooth as Old English but it is almost there and has a higher alc/vol. If you are choosing something that is cheap and will get you drunk, I recommend this. If you are looking for a quality beer experience then obviously this is not a good choice.",3.25
Stack 101 High Gravity Smooth Lager,"Correction on the abv this is 9.9% abv unless they are selling the pictured 12% abv somewhere else in the country, I'm always excited to try the next horrible malt liquor release, I'm guessing this will get the straw-ber-rita flavor out of my mouth. Appears the color of apple juice, faint white head, smells a bit like peanuts and geriatric farts with a metallic twang. Guess what this beer is going to go over big with the college kids under two bucks and they will temporarily lose their vision. My god, what is that stuff, lord help the beer industry, why is this swill acceptable there's dead Mexicans and Unicorn tears in this beer at least that's what the label screams with the font with depicted unicorn wings taking you to heaven when you have your first near death experience going head to head with your frat brothers with this beer in a beer pong tournament. Alright can we finally sue somebody for false advertisement, I give Coors the benefit of the doubt I'm sure they really frost brew their products, especially if these guys are able to label it as a SMOOTH LAGER, unless smooth is a contraction as in this lager will make you say someone I'm missing a tooth (s'm'ooth), because the people of West Virginia (my hometown) state a championing a beer that will help them loos s'more teeth. I can't even take another sip, okay for the review and the fine people of West by God Virginia here it goes...rancid flavors that are making me poetic. I will finish by saying this apple juice looking malt liquor will rot some more teeth out it will definitely s'mooth you. Mouthfeel is similar to sever acid reflux that never goes away, not typical GERD which is caused by food and drink we expose ourselves to this is gut wrenching stomach acid like on the palate that feeling after you've puked in your mouth but caught it just in time.

Holy god, this is sweetened or something. Bitterness and alcohol poorly covered up by some sort of malt flavoring. Really awful and fake tasting. No smoothness about it. Each new sip is a shock to the system. So time to chug. No that's not exactly possible either, as it's so distasteful that it activates the gag reflex.

Smells like green apple jolly ranchers, grape juice, and bum wine.

Tastes like cheap wine, grainy apple, cheap booze. Numbing alcohol deadens the palate after a couple sips. Gassy, sweet, and astringent, harsh and unpleasant to say the least. Green apple aftertaste dries out the mouth like a shot of liquor, with a similar boozy aftertaste. A messy and harsh cheap buzz.

Nice robustness, complexity, and balance of pale/roast malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%.

I bought this because I was pleasantly surprised by Michelob Lager, but this compares unfavorably to that superior lager. This has some toasty amber malt notes but they're buried, leaving only an insipid one-two punch of 2-row barley and muted Noble hop grassiness to satiate.

Shallow and simple but certainly drinkable. Not a beer I'd want to revisit another sixer of, but there's no doubting it'd pair fine with pizza or spicy wings.

Michelob Ultra Amber,"Marroon-ish hue and no real head to speak of. Smell and taste of yeast and some bitterness at the end. Very, very carbonated and almost drinks like a beer-flavored La Croix. It’s equally inoffensive and unremarkable for a light beer. If you’re maintaining a low-calorie diet I guess this one could make a lot of sense (3.2 carbohydrates, 95 calories, 4%ABV). It’s better than Bud Light.",2.25

Michelob Ultra Amber,"12oz bottle bb 2/1/18 poured into a vintage Michelob pils glass at fridge temp 4% ABV, 3.2 carbs, 95 calories. The beer pours bright very light amber with instantly gone off white head. Zero retention, zero lacing. The aroma is faintly beery mostly from yeast I suppose. The flavor is a dash of caramel malt applied to the most nuetral base beer ever. The mouthfeel is very thin bodied, highly carbonated, and very dry in the finish. There is a hint of soapy, oily texture in the aftertaste. Overall, good (for an ultra light beer).",2.75

Crown Lager,"Reviewing this from memory, around 6 years ago.

This is possibly as bad as VB, I am not sure. In fact it just tastes the same, except the price is more and there is a big gay gold crown on the label. It just tastes like it has been pasteurized at 1000 degrees for a day...all of the ingredients are just so tasteless and heavy. All you want to do is either down it or chuck it. But it is too heavy to down...and too expensive to chuck!

The weird thing is that in Australia, it is a premium lager. Premium to what haha..? Seriously though I actually think VB is superior to this (at least in price). So what is it superior to?

Anyway, they obviously have a good marketing department, respect to them, somehow by putting a crown and gold tint to the label they convince a country that their product is premium, and they are still selling it!",1.0
Crown Lager,"compared to its style across the globe, its better than many. sold in australia as an ultra premium lager, and priced as such, i am surprised to see it among the worst of the worst here on BA. i think its better than its ratings. in these styles, adjunct lagers, its not really about whats there, its about what isnt, and a strict adherence to some key criteria. there are no off flavors here, ever. its not boldly flavorful like good craft lagers, but there is an appreciable malt flavor to this without any metallics or sweetness, check that box. it also fits the mouthfeel specs, a little fuller bodied than the light lagers which i like, smooth and satisfying when ice cold, with ample carbonation and not much residual sweetness, check that box too. its also sort of better out of the bottle, which is generally how i drink this kind of beer, so thats cool too. i dont think it warrants the higher price it fetches, but i do think its got a leg up on a lot of the american adjunct lager brands, for whatever thats worth...",3.0

Faint hop and malt on the nose. Some fruitiness
Light and crisp, not much going on, but a slightly off taste on the finish as it warms
Light and refreshing mouth feel. Fairly heavy carbonation

Overall a sub-par Adjunct Lager. You could do a lot worse, but given Crown's ""premium"" status I expect more. The flavor profile is innocuous enough until it warms above fridge temp, and then there a definite off flavors",3.0
Crown Lager,"Format: that nice old crownie 375mL brown bottle with a classy macro label. Always thought it looks pretty decent.

Appearance: poured into a tulip glass - mid-yellow in colour with limited visible carbonation. A very thin white head breaks up to a thin film and ring almost immediately.

Aroma: a sweet aroma of yeasts, grain and some sugar. A bit awkward at best.

Taste: and even more awkward here. Very skunky with a vegetal fug and some cheap adjuncts. I remember Crownies being better.

Aftertaste: some metallic flavours with a touch of grain. Still not brilliant, but at least the vegetal fug backs off.

Mouth feel: quite light in feel - almost watery - with a moderate carbonation.

Overall: an okay Australian macro lager, but really not up to scratch compared to others - even the standard macros. It is only AU$41 a case, but there are better around.",2.5

Crown Lager,"Poured from the 375mL bottle into a pint glass.

The beer is a nice pure golden color with lots of carbonation coming through. Head dissipated almost immediately and was foamy and offwhite. Typical.

S: The smell coming off of this one is noticeable right upon opening and that's not entirely a good thing. Typical grainy smell but also some sort of sour and vegetal note. Not skunky, but not very natural or pleasant either.

T: Watery and very light on flavor but what is there isn't even your normal beery flavor. There's a sour note in the middle with a light bitterness covered up by an unnatural sweetness. Not undrinkable, just not that good.

This reminds me of a second rate Euro Pale Lager and seems like that's what they are going for as those are hugely popular. Even so, I've had better even for the style. Not even very refreshing due to the weird flavors in the beer.

Just go for a Bud or Fosters.",2.25

T tastes much worse, chemicals and pennies, not quite skunky but a little musky, some cooked veggies, and soggy cereal

Southpaw Light,"I remember getting this beer for $8 a 12-pack and using it in the water-bath of my BBQ smoker when I made ribs. I'd use 7-9 beers in the water-bath, so what wasn't used there was consumed with the meal.

Fond memories might make this beer rate higher than it should but maybe not. I remember it being a light beer that didn't taste light, and was still better than most of the schiessebier BMC makes (even though it is ultimately a Miller product.)

I'd like to try a bottle now... just for comparo.",2.75
Southpaw Light,"When I realized I was willing to drive all over the place to find it I understood finally that this is my favorite beer.

Kirin Lager,Had a few of these with dinner at a Japanese restaurant several years ago. I don't remember anything special either good or bad about it. It went well with the food and tasted ok. Hence the average rating of 3.,3.0
Kirin Lager,"In Japan you have to drink a bottled beer to enjoy the real taste, at least that is how ai felt. Cans here have a sort of metallic taste and beers on tap can also be somewhat strange.
Now the first time I had this was in a 500 ml bottle and it was better than expected! It has quite a full taste without any disturbing bitterness, it is by far better than the Ichiban Shibori that Kirin is pushing so much. Might even say that this is the best Japanese lager... or maybe I just have to try everything in a bottle.",4.0
Kirin Lager,"This is a fairly simple and easy to drink example of a rice lager, with just about enough flavor to complement a Japanese meal without overpowering it. Refreshing and quite thirst-quenching too.",3.5
Kirin Lager,"Well, here we go, just what I needed, a beer style I'm not entirely enthralled with but will try to say some positive words the best way I know how.
Poured into a pilsner glass, the appearance was a clear yellow color with rapidly rising carbonation bubbles trying to fill a rapidly dissipating little white head. Barely any lace.
The aroma had corn syrup, sweet rice, light floral hop tones and light tones of alcohol.
The flavor copied the aroma fairly spot on. I'd say mostly corn syrup in the aftertaste.
The mouthfeel was about light bodied, perhaps just a pinch above. Carbonation felt decent. ABV felt as projected. Mild sweet corn/rice finish.
Overall, though not a style I seek often, this actually isn't a bad beer. One thing it does have going for it is there aren't really known flaws to this.",3.75
Kirin Lager,"This is it: The real Kirin, made in Japan with malt, rice and corn, in all its 334mls of glory. If you’ve ever had that other crap they sell here in Australia - Kirin Megumi or whatever it’s called - you might think that you’re not missing out on anything. But you are: Real Japanese Lagers are a delightful crispy treat - like Peking duck. Problem is if want a real Japanese Lager you need to shop at a Japanese boutique grocery store, and they’re few and far between. I shop at Genki Mart Alderley, they have a small but decent selection of real Japanese beers... it’s a shame the powers that be at Kirin feel that they have to brew their Lager as a crappy Aussie Macro Lager under licence - there’s got to be a real market for authentic Japanese Lagers now.

Poured from a 334ml bottle into a stein.

A: Hazed light golden body with a 1 centimetre white head that compacts down to a lace blanket. Looks fairly good as far as Lagers go, not sure about the haze though - a bit uncommon with this style. 7/10.

S: Aroma is quite Sake forward, which is to be expected whenever rice is on the malt bill. Grainy notes, along with a touch of sweet corn round out a brew that is almost entirely malt-driven, again: to be expected. Overall the aroma is nothing remarkable, however real Japanese Rice Lagers tend to be average in this department. 5/10.

T: Dryyyy, malty/grainy/Sake from the get-go. Mid palate accentuates that dryness with - you guessed it: more dryness, hint of sweet corn as well. Finish is like a crisp winters day in the Sahara - long and dry. Did I mention dry? Yes? Ok, glad I covered that off. Taste couldn’t be further from the crap that’s brewed under licence that I’m starting to wonder if they even try to follow the original recipe. 6/10.

M: Mid to light bodied, none of the wateriness of the Australian brewed version, and a thin but active carbonation. Heaps better than expected. 7/10.

D: This is not a bad beer at all, not Yebisu Premium good, not Koshihikari Echigo good either, but a nonetheless decent example of a real Japanese Rice Lager which has been completely distorted by this “brewed under licence” crap. Why not just come out and say it - we Kirin brew under licence because we can trick consumers into thinking that they’re actually drinking a Japanese Lager when they’re really just drinking an [insert country name] Lager instead? #drinkrealjapaneselagersnotcrap 7/10.

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Purchased a 24 oz can for $1.29 including beverage tax at a gas station in Dayton, Ohio.

Look: Straw yellow color, medium head. No lacing.

Smell: Strong sweet smell, green apple and malts.

Taste: Very, very sweet. I can barely taste any alcohol. Was actually disappointed by the lack of graininess since I genuinely love a good AAL. Virtually no hops. Remarkably inoffensive for the high alcohol content, but no character either, almost like beer flavored soda with less carbonation and some alcohol. The sweetness is just WAY too much, even for a malt liquor fan. There is still some fusel taste, but it is masked by the extreme sweetness.

Feel: Very light body, even lighter than *only* 8% abv cheap lagers like Steel Reserve and even the watery Natty Daddy. Weak carbonation, which means you can chug easily and get drunk very fast, which may be dangerous with a beer of this ABV.

Overall: My previous review was more positive, but honestly I can't recommend this beer for anyone. As a malt liquor, it is terrible even compared to the usual high gravity brews, and seems to be targeting the alcopop crowd with its excessive sweetness, but won't please anyone except those looking for the fastest buzz from a beer. Interesting because it pushes the limits of what is considered beer, but even Earthquake is way better. Stay away!",1.5

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"24oz monstrous can, procured during happy hour at the Pizza Brew in Calgary. Stereotypical inner city brick wall graffiti imagery makes up the childish label.

This beer pours a clear, medium golden yellow colour, with one fat finger of puffy, somewhat foamy bone-white head, which leaves some stringy webbed lace around the glass as things quickly move southwards.

It smells of that standard Minhas house essence - musty dank cardboard, industrial effluent, apple cores, and an acetone-heavy metallic booziness. The taste is more of the same - wet paper, a suggestion of grainy corn malt, industrial park alcohol, adult bubblegum (i.e. boozy), apple mush, and very little else - but that's not the point here, is it?

The carbonation is soft, but fairly frothy, the body medium-light in weight, smooth like vodka after that initial burning sensation wears off, and airily creamy, for some reason. It finishes sweet, all surprisingly restrained alcohol heat and bland apple fruitiness, like a cheaply boozed-up cider.

Strangely not the most off-putting, or awful-tasting offering from this brewery - sure it's alcoholic, but it bears that badge with pride, and a pleasant enough softness. Other than that, however, this is indeed the lowbrow shit you might take it for, all other things being equal.",2.0
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Okay, this is not a beer to trifle with. If one were to drink a 24 oz. can of this and then drive a motor vehicle, then he would be almost guaranteed to get arrested on a DUI charge. I drank only a 12 oz. serving (on an empty stomach) and was thoroughly drunk. Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor has a thick, off-white, creamy head and a deep golden appearance. I was amazed by the abundance of ragged lacing. The can design is completely politically incorrect, and it nuances all the wrong things about malt liquor. But, for those of us who enjoy cruising the underclass of the beer world, it is an interesting beer. No, this is certainly not the type of beer I'd drink on a daily basis, but, for kicks, I am enjoying the ride (so, please excuse any inebriated verbiage). Four O has a strong apple aroma and some grain can be detected in the smell as well. The taste is highly sweet and fruity, with some alcohol sting to it. Mouth-feel is rather heavy, and this concoction finishes wet and sloppy. Put it to you like this: if all you care to drink is Busch, Budweiser, Miller High Life, Shiner Bock, and Coors Banquet, etc., and you don't appreciate the ""wild side"" of beer, then don't fool with this stuff. But, however, if you like to go into forbidden zones from time to time, I'd recommend you try this (with extreme trepidation, to be sure). Well, for those who relish trying outlandish, unacceptable drinks like this, I'd recommend a try (at home, with an iron-clad assurance that you will not, under any circumstances, operate a motor vehichle). Although you may not like this beer, you can't really argue that it's not interesting.

UPDATE NOTE: About an hour after writing this review, I was hit with a nausea that lasted over 24 hours. So, that's what I get for going out on a limb and sampling this filth. I really can't, with a clear conscience, recommend this trash. My advice is to stay away from it and not damage your psyche.

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Oh boy oh boy oh boy! This right here is taking me back. Back to the days when I literally drank beer out of a brown paper bag. Except now, I pour it in a glass. Strange.

Crystal clear straw yellow color, foamy white head is surprisingly sticky on the side of the glass.

The aroma is a sick adjunct combo, with a really putrid sourness. Huge corn smell.

The flavor is very sweet. Highly grainy. Then, like a bomb, the alcohol kicks in. It is like someone dropped a shot of everclear in a Bud Light.

Alcohol burn on the throat and tongue. But decently carbonated.

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"I CAN't believe that I have finally gotten around to this beer! It has been in my refrigerator for a couple of months, awaiting me getting in the mindset to crack open a 24-ounce CAN of what I just know, in my heart of hearts, will be absolute and utter rubbish. I have succumbed to too much garbage in CANs to expect anything else. This is the backswing of the CANQuest - on the upswing are some really quality brews from serious brewers and then there is this kind of thing. Onward!

I got a finger's worth of bone-white head out of my pour with low retention, settling into wisps. Color was a light, lemony-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the same fusel alcohol/bubblegum quality that has been noted in many like beers. Let us call it like it is - this is cheap, mass-produced swill intended for an audience whose sole purpose in drinking this is not for enjoyment, but instead to get as banged up as cheaply and as quickly as possible. Mouthfeel was very thin with a raspberry-candy like taste on the tongue. THAT was totally unexpected and nearly caused me to gag. OK. I just made a deal with myself - I will drink half of the CAN to give it a fair shake, but the rest of it goes. In fact, I am doing a drainpour right now of everything NOT in my glass at the moment so that I will not even be tempted to finish it. Finish was breathtaking and not in any good way. My chest hurts, I CAN feel the sugar leeching the water out of my brain on my way to a world-class hangover, and my asthma is kicking. Oof. Shame on whomever made this for public sale!

I dislike that I CANducted a drain pour at any point during The CANQuest (tm) & I humbly apologize for having done so. Today is Sa, 26Mai 2018 & I am revisiting this beer in its entirety to put things right. The CANQuest (tm) has a CANmitment to drinking EVERY beer to the dregs/lees/punt/kick & this represents an early failing on my part. It also may NOT have been reviewed to style, but my current policy is NOT to f**k with original, often early, scores. Sorry.

I am SO ashamed of my original that I am going to revisit this beer. My overall impression, given 10+ years of CANflection, is that it is not as horrible as I made it sound. It is as advertised - an American Malt Liquor designed to get you crunked. It is still within the style guidelines, but I don't even want to CANtemplete them. It is like quantifying garbage. ""The maggots lent a piquant flavor ... "". Okay, it's a FANTASTIC AML, but as a beer in general, it SUX balls! Yer the top of the bottom. This is unfit for human CANsumption & any ""To Style vs. To Taste"" reviews should be taken acCANdingly!",1.5
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"I recently got a 24oz can of this from my girlfriend- she had noticed my ""malt liquor kick"" as of late and decided to get me some real ghetto fuel, all 10% ABV of it. The can proclaims ""Street Legal"" on the front. The can is interesting, there is artwork depicting a city skyline with a brick wall below it and graffiti depicting the brand and details. Very appropriate considering the target audience for this beer. Here is my impressions:

A- Again the can is interesting, the beer pours a straw yellow. Small head that foams rapidly and disappears just as rapidly. Looks like a budweiser or typical american lager.

S- Smells somewhat ""syrupy"", strong corn odors. Not a favorable sign prior to tasting

T- I can honestly say this stuff is pretty low on my list of the worst things I have tasted. I made a batch of mead last year that went wrong and it came out with a really high (17%) abv- this taste almost just like that with a strong, sweet corn flavor. It literally tastes like it might be a liqueur of some sort. I am not sure it is possible to chug this even with it ice cold. It would be interesting to find out the amount of Carbs per serving of this stuff. After a 1.5oz tasting glass of this I am not sure I can drink the can (damn $1.35 down the drain).

M- Syrupy, do not want to hold it in my mouth any longer than I have to. Leaves a sweet, alcoholic aftertaste

D- Awful, I have a feeling if you could put this down rapidly you might vomit. It probably helps to be drunk already or homeless to handle this stuff in quantity. The ABV puts it on par with wines for serving size of 6oz in one standard drink (as opposed to 8oz for a typical malt liquor)

Conclusion- It might be fun to show off at a party or if you are feeling the need for a quick drunk. Undoubtedly this stuff will cause a nasty hangover in quantity. Open can of this only in case of emergency!!",1.0

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Sent as part of the ""Good Bad and Ugly 08"" BIF. As per the conditions of the BIF, I must review and send an Ugly beer. Here she be!

Dispensed from a 24oz can with a brick wall on the side enblazoned in spray paint graffitti the words ""Four O Street Legal"". Not sure of what street they are referring, but whatever.

Pours a clear straw color with a very nice looking white head. Plenty of lacing and the head actually stays for quite a bit. Nice.

Aroma is corn cob and sweet liquor. Possibly some rice adjunct as well. Not a drop of grains but I wasnt expecting that from a malt liquor. Again, not too bad so far.

Kind of sweet when it first hits the tougue. Then the rice cereals kick in. A little bit of that alcohol gag comes up due to the sharpness and solvency of the alcohol. Kind of an ""old valentine day candy"" sort of taste to it: a bit stale yet sweet and somewhat tolerable.

I have to say, this wasnt as bad as I was expecting. A beer with graffitti on the label cant be that good but this wasnt all that bad. Of course, I served this ice cold and as it warmed, it became less and less drinkable, but I cant say this is the worst beer I have had.

Pretty dry finish and candy alcohol in the finish as well. Overall, sweet and alcoholic. If I was REALLY desperate, I may have this. By all means, spend your money elsewhere.",2.0
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Received as part of a winter holidays gift of malt liquors from a friend who doesn't drink beer and thought this was something I'd like. As hilariously misguided as the gift was, I do appreciate trying something new and something I'd never buy on my own.

Pours a very clear corn husk yellow, with a one-finger white head that sticks around a fair amount, given the alcohol content. Fruity esters, sweet, dominate the nose. Perhaps it's low expectations, but the taste wasn't that bad. Clean and not as buttery as I am used to in my malt liquor travels, but fruity in flavor and slightly buttery in texture, and a very mild carbonation. Body is heavy with sweetness, but not quite cloying. One of the better malt liquors I've had, but not something I want to encounter ever again in my life. Once is more than enough.",1.0
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Well, it's a struggle to know where to begin. Gotta love a can that tags itself.

Hops like they ran past the mashtun with a hop cone at some point in the process. Medicinal and alcoholic. Taste is just as bad. Somehow I think of Duvel: what that is, this is the opposite. No sublety or grace or balance, but oddly enough, no worse to drink than the PBR I had last night: there's something compelling about the big bruising flavor, like a big, dumb drunk that you enjoy listening to at the bar only because he's not picking on you and you're sure he's bound to pass out soon.",2.0
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"Purchased a 24 oz. can of Four O at a liquor store in Atlantic City, NJ. The can was left in a hot car for a few hours to warm up the beer and give the aromatics a chance to shine.

Appearance: Pours a nice clear yellow with a solid finger-and-a-half of foam that quickly dissolves away. Many streams of fine bubbles from the bottom of the glass.

Smell: Very corny. A slight bitter element, almost as if some of the metal from the can leeched into the beer. Aroma detected at least two feet away from glass. Not pleasant.

Taste: For a beer with a cartoony graffiti landscape and the words ""Street Legal"" and ""10% ABV"" on the can, it showed a surprising amount of sophistication. There was a very strong corn taste, with the harsh bitterness, but lurking behind everything was a smooth cherry taste, more like Robitussin than maraschino, but cherry nonetheless.

Mouthfeel: The fizz just wouldn't stop. Stuck to my teeth and roof of my mouth. Not pleasant.

Drinkability: I finished the 2-4 of 4-0 quite easily once I got past the first 8 oz. of it. The beer's feel mellowed out once exposed to air. The price wasn't right ($1.55 plus tax) but that notwithstanding this is an adequate malt liquor for, well, Atlantic City.",3.0
Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,40 ounces can courtesy of Unclemattie: Poured a golden color beer with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing surprisingly.

The alcohol sting dominates this one but maybe thats a good thing because there arent any flavors in there that I care for. Hmm.

Four O Street Legal Malt Liquor,"This can of Four O is the challenger in the latest malt liquor grudge match that I like to call Malt Likkapalooza. It will be entering the ring today with A-B's own Hurricane High Gravity. The can depicts the Four O name spray painted on a brick wall beside the words 'street legal' with a cityscape in the background. That's to demonstrate its street cred no doubt, but the 10.0% ABV is enough for me. Who knew that La Crosse, Wisconsin was such an urban jungle?

Bright gold with multiple steady streams of fine bubbles leading up to an ivory-colored head that is ultimately as creamy as Hurricane HGL's cap, but is more sticky. There's an amazing amount of lace on the glass for a beer with a double-digit ABV. Definitely one of the best looks that I've ever run across for a malt liquor.

Just as the 'label' graphics promised, the nose is bold. It's incredibly sweet and apple-like. In fact, the beer smells like a generous portion of applejack was added to the glass. It's lower on hops that Hurricane and higher in alcohol. Surprisingly, there's very little nastiness to either one of these noses. Four O takes round two convincingly.

I'll be honest, I feared this beer a little bit. There's really nothing to fear, once tasted, but I do fear what trouble I might get into if I downed a few of these bad boys back to back. Like the nose, the flavor is brash, bold and bordering on hostile. It's everything that most malt liquors are times two. Strangely enough, I find it appealing in a perverse sort of way for that very reason.

Yeah, it tastes a little too much like grain alcohol. Yeah, it takes a little getting used to. Yeah, it'll make your head spin if you drink too fast. But it's sweet enough and just well-mannered enough that I find myself sipping it between sentences rather than the Hurricane. What better recommendation could there be?

It looks as though Four O has run the table on Hurricane. Its mouthfeel is more enjoyable due to its medium-full, almost creamy stickiness. All of those malt sugars (and added sugar?) have seen to it that the beer coddles the mouth, in contrast to the flavor's tendency to rough it up.

Four O is the overwhelming winner of Malt Likkapalooza IV. I'll admit, I'm surprised by the outcome. The over-the-top promise of the name and the can graphics were borne out in the actual drinking. If you like your malt liquors subtle, look elsewhere. If you like them loud and jarring, yet sippable, grab a can of Four O and hang on for dear life.

[I don't recommend drinking most of the can while reviewing though, because my brain is in neutral and my fingers are so numb that I'm having a hard time feeling the keys.]",2.5

If you're going to drink this, drink it cold. That means if you've got it in a brown paper bag, down it!

It has the typical malt liquor appearance with a more-golden-than-the-usual-lager color, and the quick to diminish bright white head. It does, however, leave some nice thin lacing if you put it into a glass (and who would want to do that?).

The nose expresses fruit (this is a lager, right?) and alcohol with sweetish malt trailing. Hmmmm... there are some higher alcohols here too.

In the mouth it's medium-full bodied and crisp, but the heat of the alcohol gives it an extra edge.

The flavor is not as alcoholic as the nose and mouthfeel suggest... oh, who the hell am I kidding, it's frickin' LOADED! Drink it cold unless you like the burn! The sweet malt does round it out a bit though, and on that note it does have some graininess to it, it's not just all adjunct.

Overall it's not the best but it's not the worst. In fact, it's kind of the poster child for what people think malt liquor tastes like. There are better examples of the style out there and I'd suggest you try to find them as opposed to drinking this.",3.0

10% 'quality lager beer'; black can, red/gold/white branding (different label than what's pictured here)... slightly hazy (decomposing), amber liquid; ample foam build with each pour, and it actually collared and laced a bit... on the nose: fusel-kissed medicinal spice, barmy yeast, artificial fruit aroma undertones... on the palate: Wells Banana Bread beer, nuttiness enhanced, dried out and fortified/tainted with cheap, rotgut ethanol... textures: brief, round swell up front, dropping clean in the finish aside from a mild oily warmth, but no burn; delicate tickle from the aforementioned spice/nut elements; mild effervescence

summary: almost 12 years to the day, I finally found another beer with a nearly identical flavor profile to that of the Carlsberg Special Brew I had at the Prince of Wales pub in Aberdeen, Scotland; blown away: memories, reminiscence, flashbacks flooded my mind... that said, this isn't a spectacular swill (but I'd love to try a fresh can), though it's remarkably drinkable because, dang, I did end up finishing the whole can somehow (pacing?), and experienced no recoil from beginning to end...

The stylish can reimagines the can as a can of beans and leans more to the experience as the physical attributes of the beer itself.

I don't know what they were thinking with this. The smell is akin to the most alcohol-forward malt liquors, chemical. The taste retains that cleanliness found in euro strong lagers compared to their American cousins, but it is just TOO MUCH ALCOHOL. I cannot stress this enough. It goes down hot. They were nice enough to add in a seemingly random helping of hops and a touch of sweetness, but none of the rough attempts at balancing I've had in British offerings of the same style.

Smell - Metallic, harsh boozy and grainy aromas. Vegetative mixture. Not much else. Saccharine sweetness. Could be worse.

Taste - And worse it gets. Boozy, artificial sweetness some metallicness going on. This is pretty harsh, not unlike the viking who is featured on the can's living conditions, a thousand years ago. Worse as it warms and the more you drink of it.

Look: Golden in color with fingerprint-through-the-glass clarity beneath a short head of bright white that hold briefly and then drops to a standard collar, but which also then continues to leave decent lacing behind.
Smell: The alcohol is clear as are some other esters due to a high fermentation. It's quite fruity with a lot of apple.
Taste: Unfortunately the flavor follows the aroma. The alcohol is too clear, and the fruitiness is too high - the label doesn't state whether it's an ale or a lager, but I'll assume it's a lager, and for that it's too rough. Even as an ale it's too rough. It's also sweetish and fruity, and only balanced by the alcohol and some limited bitterness. The finish is sweetish and dry at the same time (?) with the alcohol and stiff bitterness fighting off the residual malt.
Feel: Medium bodied and gently crisp.
Overall: Poorly brewed with flaws.

Good Ass Beer,"I can't give the taste of this ""beer"" a low enough ranking. This is worse than making a mixed drink out of boxer and natty light.

How to describe it... Imagine a bowl of rice krispies cereal. Except, you added waaaaaay too much sugar, and instead of milk, you decided to use seltzer water and vodka. That's about what this tastes like. It's absolutely vile. I would bet money that this doesn't actually have any hops in it. It's literally less than 0.1 IBU. because again, just like cereal, they just added sugar.

I feel like I should sue for false advertising because the side of the can says it was ""brewed"". There's no way this was brewed. this was made as part of MKULTRA; in which the punishment was having to drink this crap. They experimented for decades trying to find the worst tasting beer possible.


Of all the good beers I've tried, of all the bad beers I've tried: I've never once felt the need to make a review. This beer is just that bad. a cocktail of: literally any other beer+water+UV of any color+leaving it out in the sun for 5 hours would be better than this.

Again. I cannot reiterate how terrible this is.

edit: I'm almost serious. If I could have chosen a punishment for Jeffy Ep, where the choices were 1) forcibly shotgunning this beer, or 2) literally being skinned alive, I'd choose that he had to shotgun this beer. The pain and misery of even a single sip is undescribable.

I've had 2 of them now. Because I'm trying to determine all the ways in which it's terrible. It's like watching ""The Room"". You watch it once and determine it's terrible, but then you watch it again because it was sooooo bad that you need to confirm your sanity by confirming that it's really that bad.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't think the aroma was pleasant. But it's in a sort of funky, weird way. It smells like a Best Buy. It's got clean aromas and plastic, like a new TV. Faintly trailing are DMS and corn.

I can't fault the flavor. Clean, floral, with some cracker and creamy corn. It's sort of like a Miller Lite but with more flavor. Dry grain finishes the profile. It has all of the aspects of the old fashioned Cream Ale down tight. Easy.

Feel is like water, only lightly carbonated. Only way you can tell it's beer is the slight drying on the palate afterwards.

Aroma: Some malty/adjunct sweetness but that's about it. Not unpleasant.

Taste: The same sweetness from the aroma paired with a decent amount of clean hop bitterness. The description on their website claims that there are notes of ""Hop"" and ""Brown Ale"", which I'm guessing is the sweet, somewhat toffee-like flavor but it tastes more like the second runnings of a cream ale mash. Too smooth of a finish for the style. Aftertaste of some persisting sweetness. Decent flavor for 4.2% ABV and likely has a high FG.

Mouthfeel: Light in body but with a syrupy quality that makes me question the sessionability. Low carbonation for the style. The sweetness gets cloying very quickly.

Clear orangey-gold, with 1 1/2 fingers of quickly-dissipating pale tan head.

Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity),"Pours clear bronze, with moderate effervescence, and a finger of creamy-looking, near-white head that’s very slightly yellowed. The head settles into a thin cap pretty quickly and leaves sheets of lacing.

The taste is sweet up front leading straight through to a green apple finish. I really don’t pick out much more than that when served cold.

The distinguishing quality of the feel is prickly carbonation, which I view as positive attribute that adds to the beer’s quaffablity.

The aroma has more of a toasted, stale bread aroma with some light corn notes. Not as blatantly sweet as Mickeys, but there is still some sweetness to the aroma.

The taste on this is significantly sweeter - lots of malt, white bread, even a bit of honey. There are some light bitter hop notes. The overall impression is a of a stronger, very sweet AAL.

Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,"CAN you dig it? I pulled off a major trade in the Heinz Field parking lot a couple of weeks ago before watching Pitt lose (by a missed PAT!) to Cincy. I think that I developed a slight head cold during the snowy weather and so my reviews got put on hold until my sinuses cleared. Let the CAN Quest continue!

I came home this afternoon at the end of a looong ramp-up to the holidays and I wanted a beer real bad, so I thought that I would open a real bad beer (at least according to previous reviews and its overall score).

My pour created two fingers' worth of rocky, bubbly bone-white head that exploded with CO2 to the point that it fizzled itself out of existence. Once things settled in for the afternoon, I leaned in for a whiff. Do NOT try this without adult supervision present! Wow! It had a fusel alcohol burn accompanying a fruity sweetness and a cereal graininess. This was like Snapple's antithesis - made from the worst things on Earth. Color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity.

Things began to remind me of something else, like Pennsylvania Style Ice http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/782/52434 which was made by the same company! Say, who's zoomin' who here, boys? I truly believe that it was the same beer, but under different labels.

Mouthfeel was hot, with an alcohol burn that lingered well after the swallow. It was really unpleasant as a whole. It does not speak well when I have to nearly choke a beer down. I am simply glad that it remained cold during my review as I might have gagged otherwise.

When Frio Light first hit the shelves here, I bought a six pack of 16oz. of it, and it was amazing-it tasted like a poor mans Belgain Triple! Not too long after that I bought another 6 pack and it was flat out putrid and undrinkable. They seem to have stabilized the quality control of int to where it is generally a disagreeable pretty poor swill...that said, I really am of the firm opinion that QC , or more precisely the LACK of QC,is integral how this beer may present at any given point in time...I mean, with the more expensive American Adjunct Lagers you get precise consistent product. Case in point, I just bought a 30 pack of this Frio Light and it presented as a interesting AAL akin to a Pabst, or maybe the dregs of the barrels of some very good beer?

The taste was really bland, barely registering as anything more than fizzy water. The site's style guidelines read: ""The hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma."" Agreed. It was pretty close to flavorless, but the smell was at least noticeable. It would be hard to rate it as ""Poor"" in that case.

Expectations are below average. Reviewed live. Reviewed as a light/adjunct lager since the label identifies it as such. No ABV is listed on the label.

Per 12 fl oz: 92 calories. 2.8 carbs. 2.8g protein. .06g fat.

Served chilled. Side-poured gently as overcarbonation is anticipated.

A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.

Pours a one figner wide head of off-white colour. Horrendously thin, without any cream at all, and stale looking. No lacing at all. Retention is average - about 2 minutes. The complexion sucks. So does the consistency, which is uneven. Not a frothy or appealing head.

Body colour is a clear pale yellow of average vibrance. Clean, without any visible yeast. Appears adequately carbonated.

Admittedly, it's pretty bland looking, albeit to-style. Standard fare for a light lager.

Sm: Cereals, blonde malts, corn adjunct, clean barley, a generic malty sweetness, and the slightest hint of floral hop character. The adjunct presence is obvious. It's a standard aroma for a light lager, and luckily doesn't have the sickening medicinal sweetness or stale feel of inferior light lager aromas. I'm apprehensive but optimistic. I'll add that it does smell mostly like beer, not like water. And that's an important distinction.

No yeast character or alcohol is detectable.

An inoffensive aroma of average strength.

T/Mf: Cereals, corn adjunct, clean barley, sweet generic maltiness, and generic floral hop character. The malty sweetness comes through more in the taste than it did in the aroma, but it's still not medicinal or cloying. And it does have body and weight; it's not watery bland crapola. The adjunct may bother some, but I don't mind it so much here.

Light, smooth, and wet. Lightly crisp. Overcarbonated. Decent thickness.

Not oily, astringent, gushed, hot, boozy, or harsh.

Very shallow depth of flavour. Low intensity of flavour. Below average duration of flavour. It's a very simple build, but it does have cohesion, and to a small extent balance. While you won't find any complexity, subtlety, intricacy, or nuance here whatsoever, it's got a likable simplicity and there's a fair amount of flavour here given that it's a light lager.

No yeast character or alcohol comes through.

Dr: It's a drinkable brew and I think it's better than many light/adjunct lagers at the same price point. Certainly, Frio Light is an easy target for reviewers, but I think we need to give credit where it's due and acknowledge that this beer accomplishes its (admittedly meagre) goals. It's what you expect it to be when you buy it. I wouldn't personally buy it again, but it has its merits and perhaps those on a diet who still want to drink beer would find it quenching. I think it's fair to say that it's a fairly refreshing brew and you could do worse for a beer pong* or student beer. At the end of the day, it's an average light lager. I can't fault it for its style.

Frio Light,"This beer was left at my house by a friend. I think as a prank. I was about to just toss it out then decided to just give it a go.

Incredibly yellow, with a white head that fizzes up then thins out quickly. That smell is its most defining characteristic. It smells like corn, corn and more corn. I don't mind corn. But not in beer.

The taste is more offensive the more you drink it. I gave it a 1.25 based on what it is lacking, but that seems generous after a few more sips. Up front it's watery, but the more I live with the taste in my mouth the more the it just makes me think of what it might be like to suck on a penny.

I do not care for the watery, fizz at all. I hate it. I hate it so much.

The rest of this is going down the drain.",1.25
Frio Light,"This is the absolute worst beer that I have ever tasted.

Poured a light, piss colored, see-through blond, with a white foamy, non-lasting head. It does have some lacing.

Taste is like water that has been mixed with a sir peary that went flat and skunky.

Not a hop to be had.... this is just aweful... a horrible beer-like fluid.",1.0
Famosa (Gallo),"40oz'er

Famosa (Gallo),Its not Gallo beer being rated here it is Famosa beer being rated. It's like an American version of Sofia Vergara. It doesn't compare.,5.0
Famosa (Gallo),"It's pretty average. Very light in color with minimal head. Slightly skunky, bready, non- offensive flavor. Quickly dissipating head, almost non- existent. Easily poundable and inexpensive, on sale, at 10 bucks a 12 pack at Fresco here in Central Florida. Overall, average AF to say the least, though drinkable and not undesirable. For a cheap summertime brew, not bad. Nice and light, with a SLIGHT bit of flavor and hugely refreshing. Although, I prefer Icehouse or Budweiser to this stuff, to be honest. Definitely not my weekend truck washing/ grass cutting beer, for sure, but I would take it over Natty Ice any day. Great brew to try out if you haven't already, but won't be rushing back for more. It's ok if ya get it on sale. Worth a shot.",2.75
Famosa (Gallo),"Shared bottle at local tasting, as Famosa. Pale golden colour, low white head. Artificial and ""chemical"" sweetish / sourish aroma. Sourish flavour, otherwise bland as hell, dust, no bitterness",1.5
Famosa (Gallo),"Funny that this is rated as awful. For what this is and the travel it goes through as well and the unique quality it has over other beers from its region make me question if reviewers are simply saying it's bad because it's not an imp stout or ipa.

It looks like every other adjunct lager yes. But the smells are spicy and herbal underlying beneath a cracker base. The flavor follows the nose and is pretty unique given the region and style it comes from as previously stated. The feel is light enough and inoffensive.

If you are comparing this beer to American craft beers then you're doing it wrong. If all you drink is a Dipa then why even bother with this. From a point of view of this that's why I believe the rating is low. If you like clean lagers then this is a great beer.",3.5
Famosa (Gallo),Taste like a cheap cheap beer,1.0
Famosa (Gallo),"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear light straw color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades rather fast leaving a tiny bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heaviest of a doughty and caramel smell. There is an odd, salty almost meaty like aroma to the brew as well. At the same time there is a touch of bread and some light must.
Taste – The taste begins with a crisp cracker and caramel malt flavor mixed with a touch of graininess and some light hay. As the taste advances, the graininess increases and is joined by some very light lime like tastes. Toward the very end the sweetness increases a touch and with a bit of herbal flavor, one is left with a crisp, slightly sweeter, lager taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thin and crisp with a carbonation level that is average to slightly higher. For the style and the abv. the feel is great and makes for a nice crisp sipper.
Overall – A nice crisp “Mexican” actually Guatamalan style lager. Very easy drinking.",3.5

Famosa (Gallo),"Doesn’t blow you away in any category, but very few pilsners do. It’s super light in body & flavor, probably a good substitute for water when it’s hotter than hell in Guatemala. Tastes a little sweet when poured into a glass and is most refreshing straight out of the can.",3.0
Famosa (Gallo),"There is no date on the bottle. The pour is straw colored. The taste is grains, malt, with a touch of hops. I'm not getting any corn syrup in this beer, I would drink this again.

Famosa (Gallo),"Well, first up: it’s better than jail hooch. But nah, it actually ain’t that bad. It definitly is one of the most clear beers I have ever seen - I mean, this thing is more transparent than Trump’s brainwaves. Taste is here and there. Bad, but not all that bad (like Raul’s first sexual experience). I mean, I’ll drink it and high five my friends after - but greener pastures in the future are in-store.

Yep!",2.5
Famosa (Gallo),"(1000 ml bottle - though it says 1 qt 1.8 oz on the label... no bottle coding... purchased cold... poured into a liter Maßkrug)

L: crystal-clear, pale yellow-gold liquid; stupid amount of frothy, rocky white foam, as if this is over-carbonated or expired; loose honeycomb of bubbles on the sides, but beautifully craggy, tight cottony head in the middle... hmm, looks dreamy; Himalayan lace

S: almost smells skunked(?!), but also smells like a junk, dusty German pils (a la Bitburger?)... it gets more pleasant as it goes, almost like honey atop cream of wheat... overall intensity is mellow yet has relative depth

T: ultra-dry, cereal meal malt base; the finish does a relative 180, shifting to a restrained herbal-grassy bitter bite, as well as vague nutty-nougat malt; the combo of the grain and green lend a peculiar earthy color, perhaps like woolen upholstery??... it stays rather dry throughout, but the malt does tease with a faint honey sweetness... as it goes, it does improve (it's gotta breathe); the malt and perfumy phenolic aftertaste is rather Euro pale

F: slow flow and finish, though cut dry at the bottom and back... the warmth lingering may in part be the bitterness and/or smoky phenols

O: perhaps reminds me of Tsingtao maybe?; at any rate, definitely more akin to a Euro pale than AAL; grew on me along the way... had to get this bottle for its novelty gargantuan size - the empty bottle itself feels almost as heavy as a six-pack (of full cans)... I could see grabbing this again, especially in the liter bottle; funny conversation piece (1466)",3.75

M: Light bodied with low effervescence.
O: A nicely constructed AAL. Drinkable and very enjoyable.",3.75
Famosa (Gallo),"12 fl oz cans run $7.49 USD per sixer at some grocers in Austin, TX.


""Lager beer."" ""Contains sulfites.""

Pours a dull depleted yellow body. Clear/obviously filtered, but lifeless.

Head is thin and a bit weaky, but pleasantly fluffy.

AROMA: Mineral water, faint 6-row, obvious maize, a hint of starchy grassy hop character. Marries its adjunct to the rest of its profile decently, but the corn would be obvious even in a blind tasting. Suggests a skullable neutral lager with an inoffensive taste.

TASTE: Pleasant 6-row and corn sweetness is the name of the game in this simple lager, but a bit of fringe grassiness from limited hopping does surface as well.

TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, clean, refreshing, and approachable. Light-bodied. To give it credit, it's not a watery or syrupy brew like so many budget lagers. A little soft. Its texture is probably the best executed aspect of it.

OVERALL: A step up from most adjunct lagers and Euro pale lagers out there, with a refreshing taste and enough flavour to make it worth pairing spicy food with. Would make a nice table beer not to think too much about, but it's not worth seeking out. Within the style, it's generally well-executed. I could pound a sixer in a sitting.

Famosa (Gallo),"Quart+1.8oz (that's a liter in metric) bottle poured into 14oz teku. Poured a very hazy uric yellow with over an inch of white head that moderate retention and light lacing.

The aroma was low grain, low hopped, and a lot of skunk, despite the brown bottle.

The flavor was a big step-up, the skunk was almost non-existant, the grains had a gentle background, and there was a touch of floral hops.

The body was light, crisp, smooth, almost refreshing (and probably would be in a humid or beach side environment), and finished much drier than I anticipated.

Drinkability was fine, I knocked off that bottle with no problem. Overall, about what I expected when I grabbed this $4 quart+. If ya don't try it, you're not missing anything. But, if you're on the lookout for a lawnmower/beach/river/lake/chore beer, ya could do worse.",3.0
Famosa (Gallo),"From a bottle. Pale golden color with fluffy white head. Sweet malt and straw smell. Light feel. Sweet malt flavor with just a hint of floral hops. Just your standard AAL, nothing really stands out. A way to check Guatemala off your list, but that's about all to recommend it.",2.25
Famosa (Gallo),"Poor perhaps, but certainly not as poor as these average ratings.
Let's not have high expectations for this beer. It is made to be refreshing in a tropical climate. If it is expected to go with the native kitchen, it is somewhat spicy which requires a modestly soothing beer... which Famosa is. And the brewer has been in business for 125 years in a small country, which means (to my cynical mind) that the brewer is in tight with the powers-that-be and doesn't have too much competition... and so doesn't have to get better.

As for Famosa, it does not have good Looks. It Smells better as I get mostly malt. Tastes are balanced by hops. It finishes clean and refreshing, tho not full.

Would I have it again? Well, I have no choice. I bought a sixer. Maybe I should become a trader. I am nonetheless glad to add another country to my list... and move on.",2.75
Famosa (Gallo),"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into glass. Undecipherable stamping on bottle neck.
Clear, straw colored body. Half a finger of white head upon pouring, which eventually disappeared. No lacing.
The skunky aroma was immediately apparent upon opening, which is unfortunate because the real beer smells show sweet malts and spicy hops.
Taste is also skunky, but there is a sweetness to the malts and a spiciness to the hops that is not generally found in ""Mexican"" lager beers.
Thin to medium mouth feel. Good carbonation. Besides the skunk, this beer is more refreshing than smooth.
I liked the heightened flavors of sweet malts and of spicy hops. If I can find this beer in the can, I will try again and report back.",3.0

“XF WB XH C 1412 XF WB XI”” on can bottom. On shelf in the store. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 4.
Body – Light yellow, clear, very slight effervescence.
Head – Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), white, medium density, good retention, diminishing to a four to seven mm ring slightly fed by effervescence and a thin complete layer. Head retraction leaves a few small islands of tiny bubbles and a nearly complete ring of thin lacing.
Lacing – Very good. Volume reduction leaves a wide raggedy band of tiny bubbles with stalactites and connecting columns to the next band.
First pour – Light yellow, nearly colorless, clear.
Aroma – 3 – Dimethysulfide.
Flavor – 3 - Not much. Some corn and a very slight bitterness. No alcohol (5 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 3 – Thin, watery, soft carbonation.
Impression and interpretation – 3.25 – Very much better than expected. Lacks the skunkiness of mercaptans which I expected. Seems a little less crisp than US AALs but otherwise very drinkable. I can definitely see this being desirable when working or eating in the Yucatan or southward area.",3.5

Amstel Light,"Pours a pale straw color with a quick receding white head, Smell is basically earthy grains. Taste is light maltiness with a nice crisp hop bite. Feel is crisp and refreshing, light bodied, finishes semi dry. Overall for a light beer this is not bad at all. It is thin and lacking flavor,(but we are talking about basically a 3/2 beer) For what it is the ratings do not reflect the quality. High ABV stouts (even crappy ones) get above a 4 if the ABV is Above an eight. I am judging this for what it is. A weak,3/2 beer.",3.5
Amstel Light,"L - Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass. One and a half fingers of light off white head on an aggressive pour. Fades to a lightly foamy film. Lacing shows on agitation, but quickly returns to liquid. Lots of carbonation showing from the nucleation in the glass that is easy to see through the clear light straw color.

S - Honey and crackers up front. And that's really it.

T - Sweet honey and bready cracker taste follows scent. Maybe even some hints of cornbread. Very very minor crispness in the middle, but really muted and fades fast. The sweetness of the flavor is pleasant, and not skunky at all like some other reviewers have experienced. No real bitterness to speak of.

F - Thin mouthfeel like other light beers, but not total water. A nice amount of minor carbonation. Very easy to drink

O - Overall, this is one of the better mass produced light beers I’ve tried. It actually has a palatable and pleasant (if not straightforward) flavor profile. At this time, I’m not normally reaching for light beers, but if I had to choose a light beer, this would be the choice for now. Perfectly refreshing for outdoors and camping. Recommended for those seeking a mass produced light beer other than the big three American labels.",3.25
Amstel Light,"Look: Pours a crystal clear yellow color with a one finger soapy white head. Head lasts for about two minutes before fizzling away.

Aroma: Clean notes of cornbread and very, very light notes of spicy noble hops.

Taste: Sweet and mild. The flavor follows the nose, mostly just flavors of sweet corn, white bread. It ends on very gentle flavors of slightly spicy, floral hops. No off metallic or sour flavors. Not watery.

Feel: Very light and bubbly, but not seltzer or soda like. The sugar profile gives it some body.

Overall: For a light beer, it's pleasant enough. The flavor is very light and what little flavor it does bring to the table doesn't offend the palate. For a cheap beer it's alright.",3.0

The smell started a little skunky that's the norm for many a European lager, then drifts to bread-like sweetness. There is ample carbonation. The taste is lightly sweet, with just a little hoppiness to the finish. It isn’t much, but it does make the initial sweetness more tolerable. Unfortunately, the body and mouthfeel are like water.

Amstel Light actually has more color to it than many light beers, leaning more to a amber than the transparent golden liquid of most light beers. Taste-wise you get that classic euro-skunk taste followed by a malty breaded taste that is missing from most corn juice tasting light beers.

Very clean with a slight woody undertone. Throughout the beer, there is a constant reminder this is a light beer. everything is toned down and muted. As for feel. Very thin, watery and not silky or creamy. I'v found this to be a theme with some european lagers. So not really a point of contention. Overall, Good, Enjoyable Light Beer.

St. Pauli N. A.,"BOTTLE: 12 fl oz. Green glass with a pry-off crown cap. $7.99 USD for a sixer at a local convenience store in New Orleans, LA.

Currently #55 in the Top Low Alcohol Beers list.

APPEARANCE: Clear yellow-copper body with no yeast/lees. Appears filtered and clean. Head is .5cm, dying almost instantly.

Looks appealing for what it is, but its overall appearance isn't standout.

AROMA: Sweet adjunct-like notes. Malt extract. 6-row...smells like a maltster floor. I don't find much hopwise...maybe a scintilla of Noble hop grassiness if I really look for it, expecting it to be there.

Aromatic intensity is medium-high.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Drinks clean and easily aided by crisp carbonation and a smooth wet mouthfeel. Clean 6-row and malt extract up front with a big fresh malt finish. Simplistic, sure, but it's also balanced. I do get hints of buttery and metallic notes, but they're barely noticeable. A bit of green apple skin in the third act.

Light-bodied and very approachable. Has more depth of flavour than many full strength beers I've tried, and it has more authentic flavours than a lot of the flavored ales sitting on shelves across the U.S. and Scandinavia.

OVERALL: A very refreshing well-brewed clean drinking lager with a simple but enjoyable malty flavour profile. One of the better low alcohol beers I've tried.

St. Pauli N. A.,"St. Pauli Girl's NA is the ""gold standard"" by which I measure all other NAs. Though I am not such a connoisseur as to typically rate the ""look"" or ""feel"" of a beer, there is nothing I love more than the skunky smell of a good German beer--and nobody does it better than St. Pauli Girl! This is the beer that never lets me down, that never fails to elicit waves of joy upon sight, smell, taste, and after-effect.
Though as an alcohol drinker I became a devoté of Guinness Stout and the bitters, pilsners, and ""black and tans"" of the British pubs, I have always loved and preferred the smell of a good skunky beer like Heineken, Beck's, and St. Pauli Girl. The effect of those smells are Pavlovian as my earliest exposure to beers were in the company of my grandfather and great grandfather who were true devotés to all-things German--including their beers.
I look forward, through this site, to exploring NA beers as-yet unfamiliar to me. I am open to suggestions but be forewarned: I am VERY biased toward my skunky beer!",5.0
St. Pauli N. A.,"Minor froth and pale for a lager, what is lacking in first impression is compensated for in taste and a crisp, refreshing finish. For non-alcoholic, I don't think there are many that come close. It's actually much better than a lot of regular beers.

Mouth feel is medium-thin with a velvety, crisp feel. Overall, notes of beer, but without the alcohol. It drinks with some presence despite being a non alcohol lager.

Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Good aromas with bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey, pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Bit of cardboard from the NA process in aromas/flavors, but not overwhelming. Nice robustness and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, bready/grainy/sticky, and fairly crisp balanced mouthfeel that is good. A bit rough, but easy drinking. Overall this is a pretty good NA pale lager. All around good robustness and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. Very flavorful and not watery. Tastes very similar to the other NA beers I've had before. I've gotten used to the flavor, so if you can get past the cardboard thing they all have, they are enjoyable.",3.5

Michelob Golden Draft Light,"Poured from can into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer is pours a light golden color with a billowy white head of fizzy foam. The head fades very fast to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the beer is light overall, but consists of some cracker and bread as well as a bit of corn and caramel sweetness. There is a little bit of light hop as well as some light papery aromas.

Taste – The taste begins light and crisp with a cracker and lightly corn and caramel sweetened taste. The tastes are light upfront (appropriate for a light brew) and continue so throughout. There is a little loss of sweetness as the taste advances and along with some increases in a grassy hop and a little bit of grainy malt flavor, one is left with a light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite light and thin with a carbonation level that is high. For the light brew style the feel is great and makes this an easy drinking session style brew overall.

Overall – For the style this is a rather decent light adjunct. Not super flavorful, but low cal, easy drinking, crisp, and sessionable.",3.25

Michelob Golden Draft Light,"Michelob Golden Draft Light brewed by Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 4.10% This brew pours out a nice Light golden amber color with a small white head. Really spotty lacing to this brew, it does stick to the glass. The smell is rich with grains and malts. There are also some faint hops in the smell of this brew. It has the smell of most American light Lager brews on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste, it is rich and strong with flavors. I really enjoy the flavors in this brew. For being a light brew, it has some balls behind it. Reminds me of a regular brew more than a light brew. You pick up on some nice smooth grians and malts in the taste of this brew. For being a light brew, it has a lot going for it. To me this is what Light brew should taste like. This is a nice bold light bodied brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving Michelob Golden Draft Light a 4.50 out 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the chance to. This is one of Anheuser-Busch, best keep brews. If you get a chance to try this brew, look it up and review it as an light brew.

I'm not comparing it to a St Bernardus Abt 12, that would make no sense at all. I like it much better than Coors light or Molson Canadian, which are the usual beers on tap at the karaoke bars here.

Its got a sweet taste, again, I almost think of apples even tho its clearly not in the taste pallet but still... You can taste the hops or grains for sure so that ads to the authenticity of the lager.

It's inoffensive, refreshing, and tastes better than it has to. In terms of low-cost options in the Canadian brewing sector, I really can't fault it. But there's no sense pouring it into a glass, and there's no sense drinking it anything less than absolutely ice-cold.",4.0

Poured into a Jever Pilsener glass, this was a chill-hazed, slightly amberish golden color, with a miniscule white head that receeded to a thin collar in seconds. Despite the lack of head there's lots and lots of bubbles arcing skyward. No lace at all.

Big, crude grainy aroma and hints of white wine, so 50% what I expected and 50% WTF.

Grainy malts with a side of diacetyl. Yum...

Light bodied, but not as light as it should be. Lousily low level of carbonation.

Smell: sweet with a definite corn pops character thrown in the mix. The can says all-malt, but it does indeed smell quite adjunct-y. Not great, but relatively free of off-putting aromas.

Taste: like the aroma, it's quite sweet with a hint of corn, but really it's not too bad. Nothing I would go out of my way to get, but as the style goes, there's at least a little flavor here. One unfortunate area is hops, though -- they are not at all distinguishable. Points lost for that.

Snow is China's best selling beer. It originated in Shenyang. So, it can be found anywhere in Shenyang. They were owned by ABInbev but they've been sold to a Chinese company HQ'd in Hong Kong.

T - light, bland with no hint of grains; again, a rather bland beer

This stuff is about %2.5 ABV and 9 degrees plato (says so on the 500ml can).

look: Perfectly fine, nice golden yellow with a head that fades quickly, for Chinese beer it seems to be the norm.

Smell - a bit of grains, light and grassy, not much to say here either.

Taste - bland, like your average light beer.

Feel - like most Chinese lagers, rather light, smooth and fizzy.

I had the misfortune of drinking a Vermin Belch the other day, and I couldn't even finish it.

Victoria Bitter (VB),"Victoria Bitter. VB. The Virus Beater. The Very Best. The Vomit Beer. Victor Bravos. There's almost as many analogies for Victoria Bitter, as litres of this stuff drunk on a daily basis. It's arguably Australia's most famous beer - piss off Fosters - and is certainly the most popular. There's hardly a pub where you can't find it either in tap or can/stubbie, and the words to the jingle are more well known than the lyrics to the national anthem (is it girt by sea, or gird by sea?)

You either like VB, or you don't. There's no room for sitting on the fence with this beer. It's either something more sacred than holy water, or if your mum was on fire, you wouldn't even use it to try and extinguish her. I used to hate VB, I used to hate the bogan connotations that came with drinking this beer. I used to hate people who drank it. I was a downright snob, and used to look down on people who drank it - especially religiously. But my palate is diversifying, and let's give it a go, to see if I still hate it, or whether it's something that is at the very least tolerable.

Look: This is going to be my 11th beer review, and all but 2 so far have been Aussie adjunct lagers. I will get to the better beers eventually. Poured into a pint glass, we've got a lovely honey gold liquid, clean, filtered. A thin finger of foam has accumulated at the top, but it didn't froth up. It's a little darker than your standard Aussie adjunct lagers, and it actually looks more appealing.

Smell: The classic Aussie adjunct lager smell. Heavy earthy grassy notes come courtesy of the Pride of Ringwood hops, sweet pale malt, slightly sour. Am I overreacting by saying the sourness almost smells like Orange peel? I remember thinking it used to smell offensive. I no longer do. it just smells classically Australian.

Taste: Malty sweetness, nice bitterness. Getting that grassy citrus peel flavour coming through on the bitterness. Smooth, easy drinking. Flavours are mellow, but prominent. Subtle sour tang with a dry finish that makes me want another sip. Slight adjunct taste but not overly powering.

Feel: Fairly highly carbonated, which makes it convenient to slam down that ice cold beer. Ice Cold it is extremely refreshing. Body is medium,

Overall; Either I've lowered my expectations, or I've diversified my palate, and I'm no longer a snob. I can't hate this beer any more. I'm not saying I necessarily love it, but I have grown to appreciate it. It's a part of Australian culture, and it's not going anywhere soon. It's certainly more drinkable than I remember it, and whilst I probably won't go buying slabs of this stuff, I certainly won't hesitate to go for it if I'm at the pub and there's nothing else worth drinking.

Will say, the beer has to be drunk cold. Ice cold. You can't afford to let these warm up,. Once it's creeping up to room temperature, the bitterness from the hops seem to curdle and you get all sorts of nasty flavours going on. That's where I think most people go wrong with VB. It's simply not served cold enough. Most lagers should be ice cold, and ice cold is where the respectable flavours come out to play. Once it starts warming up, grab another one, or just drink em quicker.",3.0

Victoria Bitter (VB),"Sure it's just another commercial lager, but with it comes good memories of a broke youngster partying at the local RSL, hence the higher score.

Victoria Bitter (VB),"I've had it numerous times in pint glasses, stubbies, straight out of the can, even off the ground on one drunken evening.

The look is like any other dime-a-dozen lager, that classic piss-yellow tint. The smell has hints of alcohol and rice. The taste is well, I don't know; Like a Budweiser but with more tang. The feel is below average. Very carbonated and watery.",3.75

Looks a bit darker in color than its American counterparts and has a faint smell (of apples?) but still okay.

Then I read that it has added sugar, perhaps that's where this strange sweetness comes from! To sum it all up, it is not that bad overall (have been drinking Japanese adjuncts for weeks now celebrating the end of the year in 2017), even my wife seems to like it! It isn't a craft beer but it's not even supposed to be one. It is an okay American type lager, not great but nothing to complain about really.",3.25

However I was forced to drink this often, as a result of Aussies who regularly insisted on buying me a drink because of my ""accent"" and how drunk they always were! Haha...

This has a dryness and heaviness that makes it difficult to drink fast, and an overall flavor that is not really a flavor. It tastes like it has been pasteurised at 9000 centigrade for a year.

Beer in Australia is really expensive, Carlton and United must be making more money than Vegemite..

Had another recently in Bar Oz in Paris. Even compared with Euro lagers like Heineken and Carlsberg, this is even worse. Probably the worst beer I have had, it is really quite amazing how many Aussie hillbillies love the stuff.

Red,"Yesterday I reviewd Gold Bitter - Tooheys Gold, and commented how the Toohey's Bitter series whose zenith came about in the 80s and early 90s, has seemingly died out. Red Bitter, is seemingly still around, and able to be purchased in 30 can blocks. However, my local has them in singles cans too. As mentioned in my Gold Bitter review, despite the fact these beers are rare as hens teeth, they must still being drunk by people in quantities worth brewing for. So it's good to see these old school classics around, even if they're not what they were in there hey dey.

It appears that they've reduced the ABV on these again to 4% - still classifying it as a full-strength beer. Let's see if it holds up to it's label as 'full flavour'. As with the Gold Bitter, the design of the can is still classic old-school, with the Tooheys Stag being replaced by the weathered looking man holding a schooner glass. Clearly this must be a drink for the hardy and tough. Let's find out!

Look: As with Every Australian lager, it's a classic golden straw colour. Poured into my Arundel Brewing Co. Pint, it's heavily carbonated, lots of bubbles racing to the top. Head is a light frothy 1 finger, but look like it'll stick around too long. As with all Australian lagers, filtered, and you can see right through the glass. Looking like any Australian lager.

Smell: It's got all the classics of an Australian lager. Although I would have to say this one smells particularly 'dusty'. That's right, dusty. Almost like you have gotten a whiff of the inside of your vacuum after you've hoovered the floor. There's Pride of Ringwood hop notes, again classic Australian lager smell, and that vegetable smell which is all too common with Aussie adjunct beers. It's not horrid, just not overly exciting.

Taste: Sweet character. Not overly bitter. Quite bland. Aftertaste gets that slight vegetable taste, almost like you've walked into a fruit & veg shop. Dry finish, that lingers with that vegetable taste. Some unpleasant notes that could be chemical residue. It's not great. Reminds me of that stale cigarette mouthfeel, and hour after you've had one.

Feel: Highly carbonated, so it's drinkable if you go quickly. Fairly thin. Not a great deal of body to it.

Overall: 30 years ago in its heyday, this might have been a once quaffable lager. However, despite the fact it's somewhat readily available in Sydney, it's market of drinkers have clearly moved on, or passed on. With it's reduction in ABV to 4% - I don't think it's as full flavoured as it once was, and the overall flavour leaves a bit to be desired. I do have a soft spot for these old-school beers, but I feel like this one may not be the beer it once was, and as such is . I want to like it, I really do - if anything for the old-school packaging, but unfortunately the aftertaste is the killer, and it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.",2.0

Red,"Format: returning to this beer for the first time in years, as I have decided to try every beer I can find (whether I want to or not). A tacky macro 375mL can with that ""look how great my dodgy 70's label that I never bothered to update"" label.

Appearance: looks better than I remember - light yellow with chunky macro carbonation sprinting up the glass. A thin head with good retention.

Aroma: the main issue here is that there is virtually no aroma at all. The slightest cheap grain and off metal from the can / carbonation.

Taste: ah. It's all coming back to me now. Very light cheap grain, that off metallic fug and a really unfortunate chemical taste of some kind. That's the disaster I remember. Fortunately it is actually quite a soft flavour.

Aftertaste: what little there is drops away virtually instantly. You can tell what this was originally designed for - to be thrown back en masse without being too concerned with trifling aspects such as taste or quality.

Mouth feel: quite thin and a bit watery, with enough carbonation to make this somewhat refreshing in the same way that throwing back a can of water might be.

Overall: this is a very old-fashioned beer designed to quench the thirst of people that didn't really care what a beer tastes like. Or perhaps didn't want a beer to have taste, so they can drink it like water while working the farm on an incredibly hot Aussie summer day. Not sure, but it's pretty ordinary.",2.0
Red,"This beer sure does cop some flak...

It's a beer that's more than the sum of its parts:

There is basically no odor, nothing exciting to look at, it's cheap, it's low ABV.... however...

On a hot day, this goes down a treat - it's easy to drink, the flavour is weak and the mouthfeel is watery - just what's needed sometimes. A completely inoffensive beer.

The flavour profile is a slightly sweet grain up front and a mild hop bitterness on the finish - all in all, a well balanced brew. Very little aftertaste.

As I crack another can on this warm Melbourne I feel pleased, pleased to enjoy something that is a very honest, no bullshit, macro lager - but it is, by all means, a macro lager.

Walk in to your local bottle shop and pick up a cube of this for next to nothing - it's great on a stinking hot day when you need something refreshing, light and don't need to think about too much. Goes well with cheap snags in white bread and mowing the lawn.",3.0
Red,"Back in my youthful days, I was often eager to grab a 30 can block of this with my mates before heading to a party for a long evening of sessional drinking. It was cheap ($31 AUD for 30 cans) and served its purpose as a cheap alcohol delivery system. Reminiscing over my childhood days, I decided to try a can of this to experience a blast from the past and bring back those blissful memories of drinking as a teenager. However, I didn't expect to disgrace my tastebuds and wretch my stomach in the process.

A: An aggressive pour leaves the beer with a head of approximately one finger, which doesn't want to stick around for very long - after 20 seconds it's gone, and you wouldn't even know it existed, as lacing seems to be nonexistent in this brew. the actual beer itself looks almost completely translucent when held up to the light, giving it a typical appearance of several Aussie macro lagers.

S: Smell? You'd think it'd have one. I literally had to sniff until my nostrils caved in to get even the tiniest whiff of aroma from this beer, which eventually turns out to contain an offensive smell of stale hops and metallic odours - possibly a byproduct of the can sitting on the bottle shop's shelf for a few dozen light years.

T: Dearest Mary Mother of God, this tastes atrocious. A fierce taste of long-stale hops grinds the tastebuds and is further insulted by a watery aftertaste. A peculiar thing about this beer is that the hops and the barley can be tasted almost seperately. It is as if the brewery hastily tossed all of the ingredients together and quickly sealed it in a can. A complete lack of anything that could resemble a body leaves an inconsistent taste which, coupled with the painful bitterness of stale hops, gives this beer a truly appalling taste.

M: Nothing much to say here - the watery aftertaste leaves the mouth pondering over whether it just had beer or soda water in it.

O: After tasting this macro again, I look back on my younger days in disgust and scorn. There's a very good reason why cases of this gather dust in bottle shop shelves and are sold at ridiculously low prices, and that is because nobody has the temerity or the low standards to dare drink it. Avoid this beer at all costs!",1.0
Red,"This is

The Worst Beer I Ever Had.

Many years ago, as in BC - Before Craft, I had two weeks in England, sampling the finer ales on offer, and enjoying.

I returned to Aus, and had some of these left in the fridge, part of a case I had, bought as I had no money at the time and this was always the cheapest beer on the shelf. I had one and vowed never to drink it again.

Once again....

Red,"Beer from a can - how bogan of me.

Pours a standard, slightly pale golden with nice dense white head, medium thickness, disperses a bit leaving a thin cushion. Fed by steady carbonation coming from about six isolated sources at the base of the stenge. Not bad, seems an appropriate appearance.

Smell? Apparently there is one. Well, there should be, it's beer. Hmmmm...

A lot of effort and I daresay some imagination gets me a pilsener-esque malt kind of smell and maybe some hint of Pride of Ringworm. But this is the imagination of some weird offspring of Lewis Carroll and Hayao Miyazaki talking. There is absolutely nothing there, really. Just a void where aroma should be.

Very uneventful, short and simple palate. If my life were as interesting as this I'd look forward to the exciting pain and torture of hell. Starts off bland, finishes bready and bland. Seriously, I would love to give an in-depth analysis of the malt profile, the intricacies of the bitterness and the beer's complex vicissitudes, but it would be comparable to going deep sea diving in a bathtub. With no water in it.

There is the slightest, slightest whisper of some caramel malt on the front and mid palate (and that is ALL there is), and then once it reaches the back of my mouth for swallowing it gives me that bread yeast character from a blend, maybe of POW and some cheap adjunct. But even the nastiness of this beer is weak and practically unnoticeable. That's not to say it's not nasty, it's just too piss-weak to make me retch.

you wouldnt think tooheys could brew a worse full strength beer than their new, but by golly they have. its even more putrid than CUB's worst, which is possibly the biggest insult a brewery could be on the recieving end of. if it wasnt for carlton cold there'd be no doubt. theres nothing to commend this beer, not color, head. smell, flavor, drinkability. nothing. ive seen more appealing substances go down the toilet. in fact i reckon if you pissed into a glass after a good belgian ale it would taste better than this. and you wouldnt have to pay any extra to get that.

Flavor tuckers out into a bland, grainy and grassy finish. Light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation. If it looks, smells and tastes like a adjunct lager duck, then that what it is. I tend to rate this style higher than the average, mostly because, although I rarely crave one of these, their strength is being mild and inoffensive to the most people, and I find them to be drinkable if unmemorable. This is not one of the better adjunct lagers, and the flavor is simultaneously a little grainy rough and quite muted. This could be partially because, despite the unfortunate ""Fresh"" in the name, this has probably been sitting around for a long time, both in shipping and distribution. I know I've been watching for an opportunity to buy a single bottle for quite a few months (my favorite beer store got quarts of this; I wisely waited for a 12 oz. single).

Sol,"Poured from a 32oz caguama bottle best by January 2023

On the pour, fizzy looking bubbles come together to make a one finger head that quickly dissipates to a surprisingly fine covering over the top of the beer. The body is a light gold with lots of carbonation and some very light lacing.

Smell is very light and almost not there, bit what I can pick up is just corny malts and some skunked hops from the clear bottle. At least it's clean apart from being light struck.

Taste is a bit of a let down. Once again very light. Right on the very first sip there is a hit of bitterness that implies hops but that quickly fades as you drink and get used to it. There is a certain minerality and tartness as well that lingers until the malts fully take over about halfway into the sip. The hops don't taste fresh at all and are only providing bitterness and grass flavors. One again very clean with almost no yeast notes.

Feel is actually decent being very drinkable and has some actual body to it although it is still very light once you get past the carbonation and head stage of the sip. The finish isn't as short as I would've expected for a beer this light amd it leaves you feeling malty and a bit boozy for a decent while after your sip.

Overall it's alright. You can do better from Mexico, but it's about on par with all the other clear bottles that come from down there. Victoria and Tecate are both better and Tecate is the same style too.",3.0

S: peaches, bready peach malt, dusty stale corn

F: light and fluffy with a small amount of big-bubbled carbonation ... it's almost flat by macro-brew standards but it's not flat, plenty of prickle in the development toward the finish; over time it comes off as heavier than a lightweight, maybe a light-middleweight

Sol,"I bought a can at the beer store in Ontario 473ml at 4.5%. clear golden color with good carbonation.
Poured a 1finger head glass that disappeared but leaving as lace as you drink it .
My can is not from Mexico it was brewed by Molson Coors In Canada.
So maybe there will be a difference from the original beer.
The beer taste very light not much bitterness and just a plain malty hint of lemon taste .
Very easy to drink thought it was gonna be crappy beer but it's actually ok and an average beer to drink .
Maybe Molson Coors did the better job brewing this beer then the original from Mexico.
Canada has better water I think .

Sol,"Sol Cerveza is one of those Corona knockoffs that seem to be popping up left and right in an attempt to gain a foothold in the light easy drinking, adjunct lager category. You know going in this isn't a beer that's for connoisseurs, and is only there to fulfill a market of people who either don't drink beer or people just wanting to knock back a seemingless endless supply of liquid in the hope it gets them drunk and not bloated. This 650ml long neck of Mexican beer, is apparently imported from the Netherlands into Australia, for Pinnacle Drinks which is basically Woolworths alcohol importer. Isn't globalisation great?!

Look: Poured into a pint glass. Extremely carbonated. Hundreds if not thousands of bubbles surround the interior of the glass, and plenty racing their way to the surface in search of freedom or a better life than my stomach. Bubbly white head that disappears before you know it. Head look promising, but non existent after 30 seconds, giving an appearance of golden soda water. Straw gold, completely filtered can see right through the glass. Standard adjunct lager look to it, nothing to write home about. The head dissipating in seconds, is disappointing.

Smell: Classic Mexican/Central American adjunct beer smell. Corn, light citrus notes, stale white bread, but not a great deal going on.

Taste: Taste follows the nose. Very thin body. Very sweet, very smooth almost no bitterness to speak of. Maybe some light hop extract, but nothing to exactly write home about. Pretty bland, there's a weird chemical roundness to the overall flavour.

Feel: Highly carbonated, thin body , slight dry finish. Highly drinkable if you're just wanting to knock these back without tasting anything.

Overall: I'm not knocking it because I don't think it's good. i'm knocking it, because unless I'm lying on a tropical beach somewhere for it to quench a thirst, it's not doing anything for me. Outside of a hot environment where you're relaxing and just drinking for a buzz, it's not worth the effort and the carbs. It's a summer beach beer that'll help get the taste of salt water or chlorine (if you're in a pool) out of your mouth. Nothing more, nothing less.",2.0

Lone Star Light,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear straw color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam. The head fades superfast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is super light with just a little bit of caramel and malt. Along with these smells comes a touch of paper and herb.
Taste – The taste begins with a light cracker taste matched by a little bit of caramel sweetness. As the taste advances some paper and a touch of herb come to the tongue all while the sweetness increases just a bit to leave one with a still dry, but light and crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is average. The carbonation should be higher for the style to make it more refreshing.

L: clear yellow, SRM 2-3 tops and so clear it looks like air in the glass, yellow-tinged air; pushes up quickly-dissipating head of white foam that eats at itself like a gose head; bubbles everywhere, and they push up a constant fluffy collar and most of a skin; fun to watch; not stick or lace

S: stale grain, sour grain, yeast everywhere ... loads and loads of dusty yeast; as it warms, hints of cracker malt show up, subtle and lightly sweet

T: grain, stale grain, big corn note midswallow through the finish and it's not creamed corn but real live corn; lots of yeast; over time it gets some of that American adjunct lager housepaint note many of them have ... hard to describe ... might the yeast mixing with other notes

F: that lightweight/heavy carbonation combination us soda drinkers grew to love; it's over carbed of course, but I still like it a lot ... helps cleanse the palate

O: the grain flavor is much, much more prominent than I expected, and while the nose isn't worthy of worldwide acclaim, every now and again you can pick up a pinch of barley malt sweetness; for the genre and at 3.85% ABV, it's fantastic. I don't expect much from an American light lager, and this one easily surpasses those expectations.",4.0

Molson Dry,"750ml can purchased from Ontario grocer. Poured into a large glass mug (the entire 750ml fit in the mug). Lively and foamy head that lingered for a few minutes and dissipated to a 1/8"" film throughout the drink. A surprising amount of lacing. Carbonation was heavy off the start but tapered off and was rather subdued by mid-drink. Smells of corn with a very slight skunk - that familiar Molson aroma that is ever present in every college dive bar I've frequented in Ontario. The taste was surprising: very little of the ""adjunct skunk"" that I know and expect from Molson product. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised with a nuanced flavor with light grain notes, temperate hop bitterness on the back of the tongue and a dry finish - no off-putting aftertaste, either. I purchased this can with the intention of slamming it in a review; I was expecting a boozy version of Canadian. That didn't happen. I honestly enjoyed it. It's simple, refreshing and was attractive from pour to finish. I wouldn't turn this down in the future.

Smell - No smell other than some creamed corn and the slightest hint of apple skin.

Mouthfeel - It is indeed dry, carbonation is a bit too much but is okay with the lack of flavor.

Genny Light,"Clearly labelled ""Genesee Light"" on my box and can label (not ""Genny Light"") - though I'm assuming it's the same beer. It also appears as Genesee Light on Genesee's website.

Introduced 1978. No ABV appears anywhere on the packaging. ""12 fl oz average calories: 100. Carbohydrates: 4.0g. Protein: 1.0g. Fat: 0.0g.""

Can is blue and white, with a simple label design. Standard pull-tab 12 fl oz format. No date codes anywhere unless the nebulous code on the bottom means something (I can't be bothered to google). Cost was $0.66 per 12 fl oz can at a beer distributor in NYC.

HEAD: Fills 80% of the glass, suggesting potential overcarbonation. White in colour. Boasts impressive frothiness and creaminess for a light lager; I'm impressed. Head retention is superb - ~10+ minutes, but that's to be expected in a 4.00% ABV brew. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. Terrific.

BODY: Not so terrific. It's a weak looking pale copper, suggesting a watery brew. Clear and clean, though, with obvious filtration and no off-putting sediment or lees.

Looks typical of the style, with a lackluster body and an impressive head. I suppose it's above average for the style overall.

AROMA: Corn adjunct, pilsner malts. I hoped for more graininess, but hey, at least it isn't metallic or anything. The corn adjunct doesn't seem cloyingly sweet, but this aroma definitely suggests a brew which is too sweet for its light body. I'm apprehensive going in...

Aromatic intensity is mild.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Okay. It's got a near perfect body for how light and neutral in taste it is; that's a welcome change from the syrupy or watery budget lagers out there. Has a nice softness. Smooth, wet, and almost a bit refreshing, finishing pleasantly creamy to pleasant effect. Only a little overcarbonated.

Flavour is neutral, hitting on faint shallow notes of creaminess, weak corn adjunct, and generic pilsner malt. Very basic, not even throwing out any grassy hop flavours. But it isn't too sweet by my estimation - just insipid and reticent. I'll take that over a budget light lager riddled with metallic off-flavour any day of the weak, but I'd be kidding myself to say it's a well-executed brew. Very innocuous and inoffensive, which is more than can be said about many adjunct lagers (light or otherwise). It's balanced inasmuch as a beer this simple can be; there's not much to balance or harmonize.

OVERALL: It's basically exactly what one expects when picking up a budget light lager - inoffensive, neutral, not unrefreshing fare that would pair well with food if only because it's so insipid and drinkable. This is the kind of beer pong brew one could crush a sixer of with ease - and hey, it's only 100 kcal per can, so have at it. At $0.66 per can (the equivalent of $2.20 per 40oz), it's tolerable, but I'd definitely be more inclined to buy Trader Joe's Simpler Times or discounted Ballantine XXX when in the mood for a cheap neutral brew. In any case, along with Genesee Beer and Genesee Cream Ale, it's surprisingly good for its price and I'd happily recommend it to others interested in some nonjudgmental casual drinking.

This beer satisfies what seems to be the brewers' aims: it's a low calorie pleasant easy drinking lager. I'll enjoy polishing off the cans I picked up and I find this preferable to many adjunct lagers out there (American and European alike). It would make a terrific Summer barbecue brew or a smashable session lager to pair with atomic buffalo wings, but it's not going to impress discerning drinkers - even if does accomplish its meagre goals.

Low C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE

NOTE: As it comes to temperature, some unfortunate off-flavours do poke out their heads - DMS (cooked vegetable off-flavour) chief amongst them. I'm forced to drop this down to a ""C / AVERAGE"" as a result, but be sure to serve as cold as possible and you'll be grand.

Hurricane High Gravity,"This is the best cheap beer hands down for a few reasons.
Number one is the taste. When I was a heavy drinker I would buy Pitbulls, Earthquakes and Natty Daddys. If it was a particularly rough week I'd have to drink Camo. All those drinks have a terrible sour taste to them that makes you cringe after a swig. The only reason you want to get drunk is to hide the same your feeling. Hurricane actually tastes fine as long as it's really cold. It doesn't have that sour and sickly aftertaste at all (as long as it's cold.)
Number 2 is the strength. 8% is lower than a heavy IPA, but it's way better than a light beer. It gets you drunk. After a rough week 2 (or 3 if you don't have to wake up early the next day) of these will relax you quite a bit. The drunk is good too unlike some of the super cheap paint thinner cans you can buy.
That's really all you need to know. The 'look' and 'feel' of this beer aren't important. It's the price, the ABV and the drunkeness. Enjoy!",3.5

Hurricane High Gravity,"Poured from an undated 25oz can into a pils glass.

On the pour I am honestly surprised by a 2 finger fine head. The body has lively carbonation as expected, is a dark straw to gold crystal clear, and is crystal clear. The head recedes to a decent covering and remains relatively fine, some lacing is left.

Aroma on the other hand is as expected for a ""high gravity lager"". Smells kind of like sweat fermented ""green apple"" off notes along with skunk which I guess implies some sort of hopping. An alcoholic note resides at the back along with a vague note of malt. Overall it just smells like yeast that was treated like an alcohol producing slave and worked way past its useful limits with low quality hops and a malt bill that's been watered down with adjuncts, likely rice or corn syrup.

Flavor is quite similar to the aroma with some harsh out of place esters and a hard to explain tartness, behind that a surprising amount of hop bitterness creeps in likely to cover up dirty fermentation notes. Alcohol is detectable and the only positive to that is that eventually the burning and inebriation covers more and more off notes making what malt is present on the finish more and more noticeable as you drink, which is about the only redeeming factor once you actually start drinking.

Feel is at first light any other full flavor AAL but the co2 bit is quite high, and the finish is quite dry but surprisingly drawn out despite the general thinness on the palate. Not the worst but not the best pretty average, but it keeps it drinkable.

Overall it could be worse, but this isn't a very high quality beer. It will get you drunk, it's cheap, and it's not the worst thing that's passed my lips.",2.75
Hurricane High Gravity,"I find that instead of acquiring a taste for expensive craft beers, it's better to acquire a taste for cheap, high gravity beers.

Well.. it depends on the batch brewed but your bound to have a Hurricane effect either emotionally, physically or psychologically from drinking it. I’ll leave the graphic effects out.

Nevertheless it is on par with its other contenders for pour, taste, smell and overall quality. Which is in a class of its own. It’s not terrible by any means.

Hurricane High Gravity,"Light gold body, clear; lively carbonation; thick white head, dense and foamy. Very faint aroma; just touch of graininess. Respectable flavor; grainy, sweet, and bitter with a fairly prominent alcohol presence; phenol suggestion. Medium-heavy body; some sticky residual sugar notes; somewhat dry with a strong alcohol effect.

A basic American malt liquor. It hits the ABV style squarely, has great looks, but little distinctive smell and the taste, while not bad, doesn't lend itself to repeat visits.

Hurricane High Gravity,"Purchased as a tall can at Exxon for $2.07. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Bright & clear gold with a one-finger quick-to-disappear pale white head.
S - Ethanol and corn come through first. Cracker and grass.
T - Lightly-browned toast and generic cereal grains. Wet hay and ethanol on the finish. Fairly sweet throughout.
F - Medium-bodied, lots of carbonation. Refreshing, but you likely won't reach for another. Dense.
O - Aside from reviewing it, I would only have this beer on two occasions: either with a friend while splitting a frozen pizza, or alone in a deep depressive state. This beer is the plastic jug vodka of beers. Depressing, terrible, but not as bad as it could get. If you're looking for all the beer part of a 4Loko with none of the added flavoring, this is as close as it gets. Would buy again, and would recommend trying at least once.",2.25

The Hurricane High Gravity pours quite well. It has a dark golden body and a small head.

The aroma it emits is one of sweet caramel.

The flavor also brings forth a sweet caramel taste, followed up by a bread-like flavor.

It is one of the smoothest and most appealing malt liquors I have tasted. Most malt liquors are consumed just for the alcohol percentage, this one actually tastes and feels good!

This malt liquor provides a surprisingly decent taste compared to the other counterparts that were place in the same area of price-range. I'd buy the canned version rather than the plastic 42oz bottle since I personally believe it tastes better.

Hurricane High Gravity,"25 Oz bottle poured into glass
Look - lots of bubbles, golden color. Foam is thicker than i anticipated.
Smell - not far off from Budweiser, stale rice and grains with some sweetness. Not too bad.
Taste - It's strong in terms of alcohol and it has some bold flavors. It's not that rough like some others are, and there is a slight (and I mean slight) hop presence. It is sweet, almost syrupy. Carbonation is high, about as high as a beer can get.

Overall, a little better than some others in this category. I wouldn't say i really enjoyed it but that's not really the purpose of it. There are plenty of great beers at 8% ABV. These are just barely drinkable and cheap to make so there is a market for them. Grade is a C-",2.75
Hurricane High Gravity,"I am one who truly enjoys finding redeeming qualities in that which is under appreciated and overlooked, however there is simply none of that to be found in this truly hideous concoction.

Purchased west of Atlanta for a mere $1.29 in a 25 oz. can. Poured ice cold in a traditional Weizen glass. Thin soapy head dissipates very quickly to nothing leaving behind a single strand of bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Many malt liqours are criticized for being too flat but this far exceeds that stereotype even freshly poured and ice cold.

Look is somewhat appealing. Slightly off color golden straw, but with a slight hint of light brown overtones. The smell is truly acrid. Atrocious. Similar to being behind a sanitation truck with your windows down on 95 degree afternoon. Its that bad, even cold. Stale moldy bread comes to mind. Taste is similarly disgusting. It truly tastes like garbage and thats what gives this selection such low marks even against the basement low expectations in this style and class of beer.

Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy saliva consistency. Some reviewers here have described the taste as ""clean"" and perhaps my sample wasnt fresh, but I would never use the word clean to describe this brew. The fusel is very apparent in this brew, not in an astringent burning alcohol way, but you definitely get the impression of adjuncts and byproduct.

I have found that properly pouring lower quality beers ice cold in a weizen glass at the correct angle and giving them a chance to head up and breathe can really bring out the very best of their qualities and true potential, if any is to be found. Removing them from their humble confines of tall cans and forty bottles can really enhance the entire profile of even the lowest quality of beers. This would not be the case at all with Hurricane. Even the best possible treatment could not save this beer, it still tastes like nasty 40 swill no matter how it's treated.

Attempting to enjoy this while watching Oklahoma's defense attempt to stop Alabama was a similarly futile effort. Taking this down was a truly laborious task. I felt compelled to pour it down the drain more than once, but I wanted to give it an honest try, as many beers have the ability to change your impression from start to finish and various points in between. This, however, did not. Bad start, bad middle, worse end.

Drinkability and smoothness are the main reasons I opt for this style and class of beer. However this had none of the redeeming qualities you can find in its budget oriented diamond in the rough contemporaries. Drinking this truly harkened back to the high school days of slamming flat, warm, low quality beer with no enjoyment of flavor or experience, simply pursuing the effect alone.

But perhaps the effect is this beer's selling point. After drinking a single glass It certainly impairs, but in a very rough and very dirty feeling way. None of the slightly bubbly giggly pleasantness one can expect even from its low quality cousins. A single can literally weakened the knees and had me faintly stumbling upon standing. But at 25 ounces and 8.1% ABV, this is the alcohol equivalent to drinking 4-12 oz bud lights in quick succession. So while it certainly delivers in that regard, it's not at all what I would describe as a pleasant buzz. Very heavy and dizzy inducing. Two or three of these and your night would likely end in the spins.

Some might argue that its unfair to judge a beer in this class so harshly and say ""what did you expect."" 'You get what you pay for"", but for so many other offerings in this class you actually tend to get a bit more than what you paid for. Thats what I love about budget beers that are overlooked and underestimated. Even among high gravity malt liqours. So many of them perform so admirably in terms of smoothness, imminent drinkability, clean-ness and even flavor. I believe many of the cheapest beers would hold their own in blind taste tests against more expensive higher end lagers, with all but the most discerning of beer connoisseurs. Hurricane however, absolutely would not, and it lives down to all the stereotypes of poor, low quality malt liquor.

So if you find yourself at the end of the beer case in your local gas station with only 2 or 3 bucks to spare, eyeing the budget friendly varieties, or if your plan is to enjoy some forties with your friends in an exercise of campy irony, or if you just want a brief respite from the overt pretentiousness of craft beers today and simply want to enjoy a football game drinking the beer of the common man to feel how johnny paycheck lives, you would be much better served to reach for any of the other offerings on the shelf.

If you are unfimiliar with malt liquor and are simply curious to try it, please don't associate all malt liquors with this. Dont let this ruin malt liquor for you.

All things considered (smell, taste, mouthfeel, consistency, effect) this may very well be the worst beer I have ever tried.",1.0

Hurricane High Gravity,"Drank from a 25 ounce can. Score is based on the style.

Look - The can almost looks a really nice, borderline classy matte white when covered in condensation. As it is wiped clean, the silver luster underneath reveals itself in a spectacular sheen. Although the ""Hurricane"" text looks quite cheap and like something you'd find on a toy airplane or similar, the ""High Gravity"" text, the cursive ""Malt Liquor,"" and the winged H logo lift it up to a fancier tier. If the can didn't instruct me to ""be bold, be smooth, be powerful"" and inform me that this drink was about to bring me ""an equally bold experience"" compared to a category 5 hurricane, I would give this can perfect marks.

Smell - Strong odors of sweetcorn, wet grain, fresh cut grass. Typical smells I'd expect from an AAL, but from a gas station malt liquor tall boy? This one has my attention.

Taste - Surprisingly hits you with a pleasant explosion of flavor. Most malt liquors have an instant or very quick repulsion to them, but this one is somehow enjoyable. Very sweet caramel and milk chocolate tones to start tamper down to a typical bready lager flavor that finishes on a weird combination of vanilla pudding and bell pepper. I am shocked at how much I like this.

Feel - Normally these high alcohol ultra-cheap beers have a bit of a sting to them, but this one is quite mellow and goes down easy. The normal medium-thin body you'd expect from a malt liquor, but maybe just a hair under the usual extra-bubbly carbonation in other examples.

Overall - I never though Mickey's would be toppled as my favorite malt liquor, but Hurricane might have just done it. Everything about this beer was a pleasant surprise to me. A weird amount of complexity and enjoyability out of a $1.50 gas station pick. To anybody who likes drinking bottom-shelf beer as much as I do, this one is a real winner, and if you get the chance, try it yourself.",4.5

Game Day Light,"The best way to describe Game Day Light is to use simple words, as this is a simple beer. The flavor can be best described as musty. The carbonation is overbearing and chafing to the mouth. The aroma is of overly ripe fruit (Grapes or plums). It has a strong head... Which burns out to reveal the aforementioned molten carbonation.

However when purchased for a song at 3.99 USD for a twelve pack of cans or even at a slightly higher 5.99 USD it can be a pleasure to drink like water and a painful tincture to imbibe quickly. I can personally attest that after nearly drinking a pallet of this beer it can liven up a party with a lack of beverages very quickly.

If you have to have a beer which you can enjoy taste-wise and you are tight on cash, look elsewhere. A malt liquor might simply be a better choice. If you need a beer that will ensure some intoxication at a decent price this is probably a poor choice, but it is an option which can be exercised.",2.0

While visiting a nearby 7-11, I found myself face-to-face with this oddity. I was compelled to purchase and give it a go. It pours a ridiculously clear very pale straw topped by a quickly-disappearing finger of white fizz. Giving the surface a deep sniff, this beer has the same problem my boy Phil Fry once suffered from: it has no nose. I wanna say there's some watered-down corn syrup, but that could just be the air in my apartment (I think my air conditioner has issues). But, yeah, I smell nothing here, as though water were sitting in the glass. Hm. A taste yields some of that suspected corn syrup (swimming in what seems like an ocean), along with a hint of rice and a slight tinniness (I'm assuming from the can). There isn't much here to be objectionable, but that's mainly 'cause there ain't much here to begin with. The body is infused with helium, with barely any carbonation and a very watery feel.

Smell: Malt aroma is grainy, slightly sweet with a hint of corn and slight, spicy hop aroma. Little bit of DMS present.

Taste: Flavor is dry and crisp. Some corn-like sweetness and a graininess on the tongue. No real hop flavor and bitterness is very low.

Mouthfeel: Body of beer is very light and watery with a strong, carbonic bite.

Drinkability: It's a light, refreshing beer best served chilled and meant to be drank quickly. On a hot day when compared to other beers of the style I think it holds up.

However, theres an entirely unwelcome sweetness here that sometimes makes me wish I’d opted for the others. Still, at $1.69 per 25oz in my area, it easily wins against Icehouse Edge and Steel Reserve as the absolute most cost-effective buzz that can be had from beer and nowadays is actually cheaper than soft drinks.

Natty Daddy (8%),"Poured from a 25oz can

Appearance is not promising on the pour large soda like bubbles that never get over 1 finger and very lively carbonation. Color is a dark straw to light gold. Looks like cheap lager. Head a few minutes in is just a ring around the glass.

Aroma is what you'd expect. Cheap beer. Not necessarily revolting but not appealing. It kind of just smells old and oxidized with a tart slightly off AAL lager yeast aroma. Zero hops detectable. Not great but I've smelled worse, unfortunately not many.

Flavor is not the same as the smell but not better. Very light malt forward but the off flavors creep in quickly. A slight tartness and alcohol bitterness and burn are all present. At first it reminded me of expired. budweiser with vodka in it. As you drink the 8% beer the flavor becomes more palatable. Not terrible but there's a lot off.

Feel is surprisingly easy to put down and the carbonation isn't too intense. The head comes back into existence a bit to give it some thickness and smoothen it out a little. It's drinkable but in the stomach it is quite heavy and the abv makes it a bit ridiculous that in the mouth at least it's this easy to drink quick.

Overall it's bad but not to the point where every sip is regret, and the ABV makes it get better over time. This beer certainly had a time and a place, but generally it's not a great one to be in. It gets you real drunk without being completely disgusting.",2.75

They should call this ""Ratty Daddy"". Not a lot of aroma or flavor. Wouldn't care for this again.",2.0
Natty Daddy (8%),"Sampling this 25 oz can cold and poured into my .5L dimple mug. Picked up can today and its been in my fridge for a few hours.
The beer pours a bright clear golden color with a frothy bleached white head of almost 2 cm. This foam fades quickly to a thin edging and one wispy island in the center of my glass.
The aroma is very mild on this brew. I get a little bit of grainy malt and some corn and apple juice notes. Smell is generally sweet and almost not there, maybe too cold?
First sip reveals a light body with very fine and slightly tingly carbonation. Slightly sticky mouthfeel that coats my lips on each sip. Goes down very easy each mouthful
Flavor is bolder than the nose and has similar components. I get some grain and corn and again apple juice sweetness. No hops to note and the ABV is hidden as well.
This beer drinks super easy, has pretty good kick and cost me $1.59 for the 25 oz can. Pretty good value if you are looking to forget about things for a while. I do find it pretty boring and not very flavorful. Wont be buying again as this we as for the Malt Liquor tasting.",3.0
Natty Daddy (8%),"This beer obviously has more alcohol than its non-Daddy namesake, but it has some familiarity with it (or really any American AAL). It's probably a little sweeter at the end of the day, but it mostly came across as rather bland, were it not for the carbonation providing a little bit of excitement.

Adjuncts (corn) seem to be involved with the malt, and while I got no hop profile, something had to have been used to keep this things from out-of-control sweetness. The main thing I got that wasn't generic was some red delicious apple.

I am going with an ok offering, since it avoided offense, but to me it was more that there just wasn't a whole lot to like or dislike.",2.5

Natty Daddy (8%),"What can I say about Natty Daddy? It does it's job, and it does it well. It's a cheap gas-station beer through-and-through. The price reflects this. You can get a 25 fluid ounce can for next to nothing. The look of the can portrays it's brand well; it's here. It's bold. It's gonna get you fucked up. It smells the same way it tastes; not great. But hell, for this cheap, who gives a fuck. The taste is sort of hard to describe to be honest. It tastes sort of like perfume/nail polish/rust/cheap beer. Like, that's literally the best mix I can describe. It's fucked. But again, who gives a shit. You need to get drunk quickly, and cheaply. If that sounds like you, this isn't a bad option. The feel is actually decently smooth for the price tag. Overall, it's fucking Natty Daddy. We all have drank it once in our life. So what are you waiting for? Go drink it you Neanderthal.",2.0

Natty Daddy (8%),"It has a rusty taste like if it was made of water with a high concentration of dissolved iron. It also often tastes after apples like if the hard apple cider or its destilate was mixed in. It's a low quality beer BUT it is indisputable winner in a cathegory of price per alcoholic content. The affordability of 25oz of 8% alcohol in Natty Daddy can be beaten only by the price of 24oz of 8.1% alcohol in Steel Reserve or the price of 24oz of 8% alcohol in Edge brand. Steel Reserve and Edge taste much better and feel much more ""beerish"" than ND. But they usually cost few dimes more than ND. In case all 3 contestants cost the same money I definitely go for Edge or Steel Reserve instead of ND.
I give Natty Daddy 3/5 overall. Although it does not taste very well, it also does not pretend to be what it isn't. The price is perfectly adequate to the quality and presents even a better deal for those who focus merely on quantity of ethanol.",3.0
Natty Daddy (8%),"Yah, so the first sip wasn’t that bad. It actually kinda tasted like cider. Then, well, it’ went down hill, like full tuck on the downhill bad. Awful. Straight metal.

Budweiser 66,"A 300ml clear glass bottle with a BB of March 2013. The label states that it is brewed in the UK, and describes it as lightly carbonated with a smooth, easy taste. Sounds like bollocks to me.

Poured into a straight pint glass. A clear pale straw colour with light carbonation. A hard pour results in a large head of white foam that disappears rapidly. Aroma of almost nothing; initially some faint malt and little else. As it warms, unwelcome hints of stewed corn and sulphur appear. Gross.

Tastes of ultra-light malt with a faint sweetness. No hops or bitterness whatsoever. This could well be the most flavourless beer I've ever tried. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with a mild tingly dryness. No body - could pass as mineral water. A weak aftertaste of stewed veg.

Crap. This has to be the blandest, most characterless brew ever to pass my lips. Almost no taste, a weak and unpleasant aroma, and no body or depth. Just bad on every level. Avoid at all costs!",2.0
Budweiser 66,"A - Very pale yellow with absolutely no head at all. A couple of tiny bubbles rising to the surface too but not many.

S - Hardly any smell at all, mainly a very faint sweet smell but bland for the most part.

T - Very bland again for the most part although it finishes with a sugary, sweet kind of taste.

M - Very light bodied & smooth going down with very little carbonation.

D - This beer has absolutely no taste other than a very faint, sugar like finish & the fact that there was no head at all when I poured it suggests it should be avoided. It tastes so much like water than I wouldn't even call it beer.

Budweiser 66,"This beer is brewed for the UK market only (I am lead to believe), God knows where it is actually produced.

Clear 300ml bottle, the cap already promised to a BA in the US. 'jermsumm' gets it in my next package.

The brew number is a special one, it means something to a lot of British people, which is obviously why Bud choose 66.

When a Brit hears the number 66 it reminds him of different things, depending on age and education. 1066 The Battle of Hastings, where we defeated an invading French army: 1666 The Great Fire of London, 1966 When England won the football World Cup for the first and only time, or the iconic Route 66 from Chicago to LA: However, a number between 65 and 67 is what it'll mean to most who buy this beer (if they can count that high).

I poured the beer into a Hoegaarden Crand Cru stemmed tulip glass to give it some class (this failed to have the desired effect).

It looked like a regular lager/pilsner/helles, golden clear, clean and bright. The white head leaving before it had fully arrived, a trait I hate.

You'll not be suprised to hear the beer had very little aroma or taste, in fact it reminded me of fizzy water such was its characterless, gassy, flavourless make-up. Perhaps I'm being unkind here, hey, no I'm not, this beer is terrible to the core (if it had a core to be terrible too).

There was a mini hint of sweetness from something, but I couldn't detect any hop, malt or yeast involvement what-so-ever it this so called brew. Most likely the worst beer I've ever reviewed since joining this site.

My son-in-law bought me this on his first anniversary of his marriage to my daughter, can't wait for next years treat!",1.0

Hite,"Drink this a lot back in old days in Korea because I was a college student with tight budget. Typical but blend Pale Lager, and it is easy to drink, gives you refresh feelings... Does not have rich aroma. Lack of body. Even nowadays in Korea, this beer isn't for savoring, but to mix with soju, making higher alcohol content which is called 'Somac' (Soju + Macju(beer)) so Korean people who tend to enjoy binge drinking can get drunk easily. Few weeks ago, I went to local Vietnamese restaurant and they had this beer for their beer menu. It gives me nostalgic feeling but skipped and ordered 'tiger' from Singapore. I would drink Hite beer again, if I only meet my good old friends from high school or college at neighborhood tavern.",2.75

Hite,"Ok this is not a beer that you sip for appreciating the nuances of its bouquet and complex flavors. This is a light, crisp rice lager that's best drunk ice cold in order to wash down a spicy Asian meal or better yet, a grill-at-the-table Korean BBQ. For this purpose, there's none better IMHO. That's why it'll be hard to find a Korean restaurant that does not have this brew on its menu.",3.5
Hite,"Pours an amber-golden color with a vanishing, medium sized head.

Smells of toffee wrapped straw and a light herbal note on top.

Has a fizzy, superlight mouthfeel, thin and highly carbonated.

Tastes basically as the beer smells, sweet malts among a metallic, bubbly carbonation and an omnipresent watery flavor hole. Develops a surprising dry note during the finish.

Insustrial lager, too light, too thin, too boring.",2.5

Blatz Beer,"Please delete if you choose to do so.
Trigger warning: the last time I drank a delicious can of Blatz Beer was around 1979 so in some respects this review is for historical reasons only.

My local beer shop on State Street in Madison Wisconsin sold Blatz way back when. I bought several 12 packs over the course of a few months and walked home 2 to 3 miles with the 12-pack on my shoulder back to my apartment on Spring Street.

Back then, Blatz was a welcome alternative to the national and regional beers available at the time. It wasn't promoted or expected to be all-star or world class, just a solid brew that you might prefer to Old Style, Schmidt, Miller etc,

All good things come to an end. After 8-10 six-packs I got tired of the taste and moved on to other brews. I remember the store clerk telling me that they had Blatz Beer on sale for xx dollars. Didn't matter, I was tired of the beer.",3.25

Blatz Beer,"Pours a standard translucent gold with a fluffy white head that's thinner than expected and dissipates relatively quickly. It smells slightly sweet, but has a very thick barley forward smell with a hint of grassy hops and a touch of wet corny sweetness. The taste is fuller than expected with a bigger malt presence than most and has a slightly hoppy edge to keep it from being sweet. It's thicker feeling without being thick like a Schlitz or a non adjuncted lager. It goes down like a light lager but it's not. Overall the sum is greater than it's parts on this one. Pick it up if you want to drink something you've never had before.",4.0

Blatz Beer,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - The logo is incredibly attractive, but the can as an ensemble isn't that great. The silver color doesn't draw me in, and the tessellated little Blatz words across the can just clutter things up.

Smell - Very faint metallic sweetness. Maybe some grape? Not much there.

Taste - The first thing that comes to mind is cream soda. Somewhat vanilla sweetness, but even with its lightness, it still begs for some bitterness to round it out.

Feel - Thin body with a pleasant amount of fizz. Goes down quite easy.

Overall - I was hoping to find a new hipster-y grandpa beer to love, but this one is pretty lame. Not bad nor good, I don't know when I'll get back to it after this.",3.0

Blatz Beer,"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 10/14/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit too fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a delicious pale adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the better AAL I've had, as expected of Pabst.",4.0

Beer snobs like to rip on basic lagers, especially when they're relatively cheap. The bottom line is, this isn't a bad beer, especially for the price. No obvious corn or rice flavor to it, no unpleasant smell or taste. On a warm summer day, I can think of a lot worse beers to be drinking, even highly rated craft beers.

Blatz Beer,"Blatz is quite good. It is refreshing and it also comes in an exceptionally sturdy cardboard box that can be repurposed for many years to come. The 24 pack of bottles generally runs about 15 dollars and the beer is quite good, several bottles can be drunk with no major problems. Many of the craft/special beers, which are good in their own right, can contain lots of alcohol and other chemicals that cause the drinker to become drunk and sick after only drinking one or two beers. Blatz is so well balanced that the enjoyment can be prolonged well into the 4th or 5th beer making the total experience on par with or exceeding that of some of the very rich and chemical laden craft-type beers.",4.75

You get that macro yellow, small 1/3"" white head. Aroma smells like mass production and grains.

Super carbonated, long boil high alpha acid non proprietary Cascade and noble hops? This is my party beer. Good in so many situations, reliable, cheap. Its not my go to for hops, malt or yeast (which is kinda fruity here, that or its the corn adjunct).

Clear Creek Ice,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - Unlike Mountain Crest, the dated look of this can isn't that charming. The design is gross and old looking, no allure to be found here. I guess it's functional, but it's not good.

Smell - Incredibly beyond balanced malty, yet almost on the verge of nothingness. A truly min-max scent.

Taste - On the verge of being too sweet, but right at the turning point, the dirty bitter alcohol cuts in firmly. The best descriptor for this is grungy. You can taste the cheapness.

Feel - Chocolate milk? It's silky and creamy, but it feels like something I don't want. I can't say it's bad, but it's just not what I'm looking for.

Overall - Mountain Crest was surprising and exciting, but this is just lackluster and disappointing. I guess it would make a good party beer at $13 a case and 6.2% alcohol, but that's the only situation I can see it in.",2.25

Clear Creek Ice,"Pours a hazy, orange-gold in color, topped with a tightly-frothed head of good duration. Good lacing, not a bad looking beer overall...

The nose is a pungent, adjunct-laden mess full of vegetal off-notes and boozy goodness -- in other words, quite average for the style ; )

On the first sip this is sweet and slightly-sour/astringent, with broad honey-like notes. Fusel alcohol is also present from the get-go, and perhaps not an altogether bad thing considering the fact that it's to be expected for the style and this beer was purchased solely for the bang-for-buck factor.

Mouthfeel is average, drinkability is slightly better than average, but I'm setting both of these sliding determinants at ""average"" and ramping up the taste a bit to 'better than average' -- for what it is it's a drinkable beer, and I've certainly enjoyed worse from other breweries over the years.

Now, I wonder how it would compare in a side-by-side with ""Simpler Times"" . . .

The carbonation is moderate dull (in a flat soda sense), the body medium weight, and cloying as all get out. It finishes sweet, in the aforementioned wrong ways.

At 6.2%, it's a heavy brew. I didn't realize it was a malt liquor until I ventured to BA. I sipped this curiosity with an open mind dispute the mostly negative reviews here.

The beer poured a thick, creamy yet ultimately slight-tasting head. Mouthfeel was actually really good, probably the best aspect of the beer. Taste was smooth, slightly citrusy. Good lacing on the pint glass. Taste was nothing like any malt liquor I've ever had.

Clear Creek Ice,"Another powerhouse beer from Wisconsin. I feel I have been spoiling myself with the generaly good beers I have reviewed. I decided to change it up and review a popular seller, based solely on cost and alcohol content...how bad could this be?

A: The head comes like a raging hurricane hitting the coast, leaving almost nothing it its path. When the storm finally subsides, there is a small amount of clear liquid puddle. It is a strange pale yellowish, perhaps from the farm land swept along the way.

S: Corn-Metal stale'ness. Smells like the beer left over from a college frat party. The remains of beer pong the night before. Maybe Clear creek ice is a mutation from Keystone Light, after it sits long enough, it transforms.

T: Sweet corn taste, high fructose syrup in some capacity. Similar metallic taste which I smelled before.

M/D: Very Light, high carbonation. If anything postive can be said about this beer, mouthfeel isn't great but ok, at least until you swallow it.

After all is said and done, it's exactly what I expected. It has the bare minimum in every category to make it drinkable. Add to it the fact the it is only 50 cents a can and 6.2% abv, and you have a popular beer. If those were the criteria, it would be on BA's Top 100 list.",2.0

I could smell the plastics factory as soon as I did the Crack action. OMFG! In the early iterations of Doctor Who, the Cybermen were molded from plastic. Is Minhas a cover for a Cybermen production facility?!? What is that noise in my backyard? ""You will be upgraded shortly. Stand by."" Nooo!

I'm back. A lovely thick head of bone-white beauty with perfect retention. Color was exactly as The CyberLeader ordered, I mean, a deep gold to offset our aluminum-colored suits, I mean with NE-quality clarity, whatever that may have meant to the former human entity who is now Cyberman # 30993. Never mind the off-task musings that are still filtering through. Nose was a perfect accompaniment to the melange here in the Upgrade Facility with a definite smell of plastics accompanied by cotton candy to increase the feel-good factor during said upgrade. Mouthfeel was medium with a beautifully pleasant taste of ... No, what have you done to me? It tasted like an admixture of perfume and plastic, like a scented Barbie doll. ""You will obey the CyberLeader and enjoy your beverage!"" Ooof, it's another Epic Fail on the part of Minhas, but they don't care. They're out to subvert us all! ""You will be re-upgraded."" Nooo. This beer stinks and I wouldn't feed it to a cybernetic hybrid under even the worst of circumstances. Finish was sickeningly sweet. Now, I want the upgrade so as not to have to taste it ever again.

Re-Upgrade complete. # 30993 now in complete compliance with Minhas plan Sol3. Lovely beer. Yum yum.",1.0

I bought this in a 4 pack of 16 Oz cans for $2.79, and wasn't expecting much. However, it's quite sweet when you first drink it, with not to strong an aftertaste. I could see some lady friends of mine enjoying this, and not complaining about it's lack of ""skunk"" that is usually associated with Malt Liquors.

Dark gold with a ton of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass and a lumpy grey tinted white head that fades quick and leaves some scraps of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is mostly grits with a whiff of alcohol. The taste isn't bad, sweet corn, green apple skin and a touch of grain alcohol. Medium bodied and easy to drink. Tastes more like a lighter malt liquor than a typical ""ice"" beer. Not bad for what it is, cheap and high octane.",3.0
Clear Creek Ice,"This beer looks like a macro lager. Its smell is faint. It lacks scary funk; this is nothing like OE; one might say it is clean smelling. I sort of like the fact that this beer, as its packaging suggests, is quite plain, in a midwestern-american kind of way. This beer should be served cold because it is meant to quench the kind of thirst that can't be quenched by hydration alone. Palate is mildly sweet with alcoholic headiness lurking just below the surface. There is nothing really off-putting about this beer. It is stronger than the typical swill and tastes fresh and unsurprising. I like it and I hope it stays on the shelf around here.",3.5
Clear Creek Ice,"Bold goldenrod beneath three fingers of sheep's wool colored foam that is of acceptable quality. Not that most loyal drinkers will care, since this stuff probably goes straight from can to mouth. A few blips of soapy lace won't last long.

I hesitated when assigning the style since American macro lager could have been chosen as well. Strictly following the ABV guidelines, however, puts this Minhas Craft(?) Brewery lager into malt liquor territory. Good thing too, because it smells like one. It's lightly corn-like, with a hint of huskiness and a hint of ethanol. Thankfully, it's too underpowered to be overly offensive.

Clear Creek Ice tastes like watered-down malt liquor. That's a good thing for those who don't care for the taste of malt liquor... and not such a good thing for those who want a big alcohol bang for their buck.

Does the flavor really deserve a description? Oh all right: sweet corn, untoasted grain and a small splash of grain alcohol. It really isn't any more complicated than that. What were you hoping for, Belgian yeast? Conjure up a flavor memory of your favorite malt liquor. Now, subtract a little sweetness, a little flavor and a little alcohol. Street cred score: zero.

The mouthfeel is actually pretty decent if expectations are on the reasonable side. The sugars give it substance and a slightly slick finish, while the carbonation is right about where it should be.

Although the scores seem a little bit high in retrospect, Clear Creek Ice does what it was brewed to do and does it pretty well. Sure it's sledgehammer simple, but it's also better than any macro lager you'd care to name. Bottom line: training wheels malt liquor.",3.0
Country Club Malt Liquor,"If this bottle has a genie, he's a greasy extrovert of a genie, probably wearing lots of bling and parachute pants.

Long ago, I helped a stranger who was struggling to unload some heavy items from her car. Afterward, she thanked me by handing me a can of Country Club, chilled in a cooler in her trunk. This is how an '80s gas station tastes. I haven't seen it again, but I recall it vividly, even now: wet dog, corn, and alcohol, with a modest armada of grit afloat. Astounding. It did have a nice sort of metallic can note, to be fair.

If I see it again, I'm gonna try it, just to remind myself of the benchmark. Nothing -- not Coors, not Keystone, nothing -- could be as quintessentially awful. The label is a perfect predictor of everything inside. If they stop making Country Club, there will still be plenty left unsold in the gas stations of 2237.",1.0

Country Club Malt Liquor,"I remember this one from ""back in the day,"" and found it, a rare find around here, at a backwoods convenience store. I just had to try it again. Malt liquors were first marketed to white men back in the 1960's, believe it or not, and my Grandpa Bennett would always crack open an 8-oz. Country Club or two after work. My mom reportedly gave him holy hell when he was caught giving me a few sips as an 18-month old. I guess that he was just checking to see if the Irish parts of my body, i.e., those that are involved in processing alcohol intake, were working properly. And thus my ghetto taste in beers, apparently. Anyway, I was not too impressed, overall. It was flat and corny-tasting, with a weird, psuedo-metallic aftertaste. As I bought cans, I can't blame any skunking for the less than par experience. Still, I will give it the benefit of the doubt, the six I bought could have been sitting in the cooler for years. Wouldn't try it again, though.",2.5
Country Club Malt Liquor,"40oz clear glass bottle with a branded screw-top. No ABV listed on the label. ""America's premium malt liquor.""

Pours a clear pale copper body with a good 3 fingers worth of off-white foam sitting atop.

Aroma yields pale malt and cheap corn, lending this some sweetness but seemingly not too much.

Taste is of pale malt and a bit of cheap corn adjunct, which isn't bad when coupled with the smooth, wet, light to medium-bodied mouthfeel. I always fear budget malt liquors will be syrupy and sticky, but this avoids that.

Drinkable albeit forgettable inoffensive fare. I doubt I'll ever try it again unless I'm after a cheap buzz. More insipid than anything else.

D (2.18) / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
""Lucked"" into another clear 40oz bottle of this. Pricetag reads $3.00 (USD). The white and gold label design looks like something out of the Reagan era.

Pours three fingers/7-8ish cm worth of off-white foam. Frothy and billowing. I can't knock it, and the retention is pretty nice at 6+ minutes. Body is a clear thin watery dark urine colour. No visible yeast or sediment; it's obviously filtered.

Aroma brings notes of creamed corn and inoffensive pilsner malt along with a cheap grassy hop character. Diacetyl and DMS are indicated, and it seems too sweet. More of a grainy aroma would be nice. Average aromatic intensity.

Taste is creamed corn, DMS off-flavour, and pilsner malts with some cheap syrupy sweetness dragging it down. Too sweet, though not egregiously so, and I've had more syrupy more thick malt liquors. Obviously, it's unrefreshing, but its creamy softness on the palate warrants commendation. Smooth and wet, and not as overcarbonated as many budget malt liquors.

Overall, it's an inoffensive brew that drinks best at colder temperatures and will satisfy casual drinkers after a cheap buzz. I liked it better this time around than when I initially had it; I imagine these clear bottles sitting around in seedy Brooklyn bodegas are at high risk for being lightstruck. Not a terrible beer, but I can't recommend it even at this budget tier (see Ballantine XXX for a more worthwhile choice for budget drinkers).

High D (2.24) / NOT RECOMMENDED",2.25
Country Club Malt Liquor,"When you drop that beer in the return slot the next day. That's the appearance. Sweet, corn aroma, nod bad for what it is.

Woof, this gives the big fusel alcohol feels. Not even that strong, but it amps it up on your breath. Its some high bitterness low hops, high alcohol, corn malt bill type of malt liquor, but without the punch, even though its mouthfeel kinda makes you think maybe otherwise.",2.5
Country Club Malt Liquor,"I am a gross fat monster and so I've been looking for Country Club for years.

I read somewhere once that it was the first high-ish ABV beer that was directly marketed a malt liquor, and I've come across more than a few old print ads showing fifties-era frat boys pouring this stuff out of what look like pudding cans while coeds stumble in the background. It would be another decade plus until ads came along that were brazen enough to directly implicate malt liquor with date rape (thanks, Billy Dee Williams!), but we still got Country Club to thank for that trend. Needless to say, this beer has long been on my must-try list.

Forties were just sitting at the bottom of the cooler in some gas station in the middle of upstate New York. I jokingly told the clerk that I thought they stopped making it in the 70s. He said they might have, considering how poorly they sold at this particular location, so that didn't bode too well for its freshness.

Untwisting the cap, however, I pick up only a faint whiff of skunk, which is actually kinda complimentary in a weird way (some green bottle Euro saisons milk this effect quite well). The skunk is almost exclusively aromatic, however, as the flavor is neigh indistinguishable from MIckey's. Trust me, I've drank a lot of MIckey's, and this is just a skunked Mickey's.

Which isn't bad, in my book, even if it's not exactly good. I wouldn't drink Mickey's so goddamn often if I truly disliked its flavor. It's not for beer geeks, yeah. But as a malt liquor served in 40s, it gets the job done and is absolutely inoffensive.",3.0
Country Club Malt Liquor,"I had been seeking this out for a long time. I found it at a liquor store in Waltham, MA one summer day in 2012. It was found in the customary 40 ounce bottle, just sitting there with a gaggle of other 40's; as if to scream out ""take me home."" I bought it and took it to where I was staying. I cracked open the bottle to find wafts of skunk, but these skunky scents did not deter me from enjoying this malt. The taste was something else, like a classic malt liquor should taste: sweet malts and a hint of adjunct.

I was able to consume the 'Club. Overall I'd have this again. Since that day however, I have been unable to find it; s though the beer gods seem to have said ""only once.""",3.75

Country Club Malt Liquor,"Second can picked up from the cheapo bin at Kroger. Best-by date on the bottom says December 21st, 2015.

Poured into a standard pint glass; very pale yellow while pouring, a tad darker in the glass. It's very clear, with lots of bubbles rising up constantly. Actually has a decent-looking head of foam on it at first, and though it shrinks away somewhat quickly it does leave behind a ring around the edge of the glass and some ""islands"" of thin foam on top.

Smell upon first cracking open the can was a pretty strong blast of corn and funkiness, though it wasn't nearly as flat-out *bad* as the smell from the first can, which I remember being by far the grossest smell I'd ever gotten from a beer (it was much more sulfurous than what I got this time, I'd almost describe it as ""farty"") -- I wonder why there was such a difference? Either way, the smell fades once it's in the glass for a bit, but taking a sniff gets you some corn and a bit of some not-so-pleasant sweetness. Fortunately, that weird sweetness does fade away after a while so you mostly smell just a bit of corn. It's not the worst smelling beer I've had, but definitely not all that great either, and I have to count the initial nasty smelling blast upon opening the can against it even if it is a bit more pleasant afterward.

Taste is actually a good bit nicer than the smell. It's pretty pleasant overall, actually -- certainly not what I expected going by what I've heard about malt liquor in general. The primary flavor is sweet corn, and there's also a bready, grainy malt kind of thing going on in there. There's also a bit of a not-so-pleasant sweetness which reminds me of the similar flavor I picked up in Busch Signature (just a bit more than in this one) and Foster's Ale (so strong it was overpowering and, when I got to the second half of that giant can, a drain-pour.) That kinda-gross sweetness seems to come out more if you drink bigger gulps, but even then it's still not quite strong enough to make the overall flavor outright *bad.* On a positive note, that weird sweetness (much like the smell) seems to be ""tamed"" more and more toward the bottom of the glass, Maybe this actually benefits somewhat from being allowed to warm a bit, contrary to all I've heard about lighter-colored cheap beers being best when ice cold.

Mouthfeel is actually pretty nice -- I was pleasantly surprised by this aspect of the beer. It's not super fizzy and prickly, but it's not at all watery or thin-feeling at all, it actually feels somewhat substantial which makes it easier to drink smaller amounts at a time to prevent the nasty sweetness from building up too much. Leaves an interesting slick/sticky sort of feel on the lips and tongue after drinking a bit, haven't had many beers that did that but I kinda like it. No complaints here.

Overall -- is this a great beer? Nah, not really. But considering the horror stories I've heard about how bad malt liquor is in general, I was honestly pretty surprised by this one -- it may not be anything super amazing, but it's definitely not anything super awful either. I've actually found it pretty pleasant to drink both times I've had it, the only real negative is the smell and even that's not so bad after the initial blast upon opening the can. If you can't afford the prices of most ""craft"" six-packs but still want something that tastes halfway-decent and feels like more than just light fizzy beer-water, this really wouldn't be all that bad of a choice -- I'd certainly take it over something like Bud Light, especially considering that this is 2 dollars cheaper for a six-pack!",3.0

Blonde Ale,It would be interesting for those guys that drink a lot of Modelo. It a session beer for the summer.,3.0
Blonde Ale,"12oz bottle - ok, back to the sorghum and brown rice extract method of removing gluten from the beer equation - gulp.

This beer pours a clear, medium golden amber colour, with two fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly fizzy off-white head, which leaves a few minor instances of sea plume 'lace' around the glass as it quickly sinks out of sight.

It smells like apple or white wine vinegar mixed with rubbing alcohol, with a heady dose of free-range berry sugar tossed right in, and an acrid vegetal graininess (my old nemesis, sorghum, right back out of Cletus' back 40 again, it would seem). The taste is sweet, musty, and kind of thin apple cider, more unpleasantly vegetal maltiness, some stricken earthy yeast, cheap dark sugar notes, and a hollow attempt at weedy and floral hop bitterness.

The carbonation is fairly light in its incessant and pandering fizziness, the body on the wan side of the barest middleweight, and not really all that smooth, as the tart and pithy fruity nature doesn't lean that way. It finishes off-dry, that stale apple cider thing still a real going concern, while the other goings on are of no concern.

Yup, the divide between the two processes for arriving at gluten-free (or reduced, I get it) beer ever widens. I can't really tell apart all the alternative grain offerings, especially from this brewery, as they are all pretty much a variation on what I've detailed here. Oh, and I just noticed that New Planet is from freaking Boulder, Colorado! How have they not yet been run out of town, or at the very least, um, better educated?",2.0
Blonde Ale,"there's nothing wrong with the look of this beer but that's where the positives end. there's only six listed ingredients so i don't know what makes it taste so bad. i've tried all three of the ''omission'' beers which are gluten free just like this one, and the omissions are good so it can't be the gluten free factor that makes this one so bad. it's overwhelmingly citrus at first and the aftertaste is just horrid. luckily i bought this in a mixer-sixer so i didn't have to stomach more than one.",1.0
Blonde Ale,"I had a colleague who is gluten-free and I told her that I would keep my eye out for G-F beer options and report back to her on my findings. In the interim, I retired from that job and I still have the beers awaiting review. I have not felt perfect these last couple of days, so I thought that I would try something(s) fairly innocuous.

From the bottle: ""Refreshingly Smooth""; ""Gluten Free""; ""Ale Made From Sorghum and Corn Extract""; ""For every New Plane beer you enjoy, a portion of the proceeds is donated to help our planet.""

Geez, Louise, no sooner had I begun to Pop! the cap than I got a bunch of foam coming up through the neck! I placed the bottle in the awaiting glass and waited for it to calm down before proceeding. Can you say, ""Gentle pour"", boys and girls? It acted like soda pop, creating three-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, bone-white head that burbled, popped and fizzled its way out of existence. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had an apple vinegar-like sharpness and I have noted this before in other G-F beers. Mouthfeel was thin, kind of watery. The taste had a tart apple-like flavor, which, while not great, was drinkable. Finish was semi-dry with an apple-like flavor that seemed to linger. I am not sure how I feel about this one as I have other tests to conduct. It was reasonable, especially when you consider the narrow bandwidth of the gluten-free style.",2.5
Blonde Ale,"Poured a light gold color with an airy looking, white head, no residual lacing. Smell some hops, citrus, and some bread, very cider like.

Blonde Ale,"As a long time celiac sufferer, I've kept up a long search for a decent (""good"" GF beer is like a white rhino) GF beer. New Planet would be out of business if there were many good options. This ""ale "" is as undrinkable as the rest of the beers produced by New Planet. I'll drink anything tolerable as there aren't many options, but this stuff tastes like you sucked on a dirty penny and then provides an aftertaste that lingers on your palate and makes the experience even worse.

S: cookie-like, biscuity malt scent, bit of cakey sugars on the tips... with subsequent refills, the intensity of the grain aromas drops sharply, leaving only a faint fragrant spiciness

T: dry, pear/apple fruit note up front; mellow, dinner roll malt aftertaste... little residual bitterness, but a subtle metallic twang lingers (am I dehydrated??)... second sips and beyond extend an almost pale bock malty goodness, but with a dull, dry swipe of any underlying complexity (too bad)

Finishes really crisp and icy with some malt. I would certainly choose this if I was looking for a great Ice beer to drink while being outside in some humid weather. Definitely more of a flavor punch than most macro ice beers and slightly less carbonated which i love. Give this beer a grade of B-",3.25

Bard's Gold,"Date: 2/16/21; I am not seeking a gluten-free beer. However, having a family member who cannot drink beer because of gluten; having produced sorghum from sugar cane in a previous job; and knowing that sorghum has a smell and viscosity similar to canned malt from previous brews, this beer piqued my interest. When pouring from the can, I was surprised by the light color since sorghum has a dark amber hue. I was disappointed with the head, which quickly disappeared (apparently a trait of malt-free beverages). I began to think I was drinking a Bud-light. I was wrong. The smell had a hint of sorghum, nothing powerful since there was no head to capture it. The taste was subtle, but having a palate for IPA's, this is what I expected. First sip to last, I enjoyed this beer. The second can was as good as the first. I imagine I would enjoy it more on a warm summer day after cutting the lawn.",3.5
Bard's Gold,"Tonight I had my first Bard's Gold and I am pleasantly surprised.

Bard's Gold,"DATE: March 28, 2020.... OCCASION: two weeks into the COVID-19 quarantine, still (mostly) gluten-free, I measure a beer shared by my Coors Light-loving friend Billy... GLASSWARE: 22oz. pilsner... pours a tawny, sallow, champagne-tinged body with active effervescence... its head does the usual malt-free disappearing act, though its bubbles continue to rise and disperse at the weight of air... really not appealing in this light... immediate sorghum, hard fruits like apple, banana and pear, candied sugars, cosmetic counter perfume overload and a base solvency... nothing really alluring here, unless you dig cider or sorghum... its first sip is dry, thin, nearly lifeless (watery) and without fanfare... a late bubble in the throat may suggest its intentions, but it doesn't muster much beyond a thin rinse... I turn to Billy, and his reaction suggest Coors Light has not been approximated... the flavor is constantly ebbing, with faint hints of berry, apple, sorghum, cheerio, and bubblegum fluttering in and out of the picture, elusively if not frustratingly so... its singular profile doesn't leave much else to say, so I end with a simple disclaimer: if you have already enjoyed malted beer in any form, there's no need to dance with this one.... if you are a Celiac sufferer, maybe these will grow on you... all the same, cider might be a better option...",1.5
Bard's Gold,"The smell reminds me of a gluten beer I had many years ago, but really can't put my finger on it - an amber ale or an english, or Epic Pale Ale? The mouthfeel and actual taste are not very beer-like overall. Candy syrup, possibly molasses, but not much flavour. The telltale sorghum astringency is there which slowly builds up as I drink. You'd probably get used to this overall if you drank it a lot.

For a sorghum beer, the sorghum is pretty well masked. Drinking multiple beers in a single session is the real test, but not sure I'll be up for the challenge. This is probably preferable to cider, but overall feels like a weird soft drink. As I live in Australia, I had to buy a whole box to get my hands on this. Hmm.",2.25

Bard's Gold,"I recently tasted Bard's Gold, a lager. I'm an avid beer drinker and have been trying to reduce the amount of gluten in my diet so I did a taste test of all the gluten-free beers on the market. Bards was the best of the lot. It is important to note that many of the competitors in the ""gluten free"" space are not truly gluten-free...they have ""warning labels"" that say they have been brewed to remove gluten...after a bit of research it appears that these beers use an enzyme to break down the gluten protein so the gluten can't be found in a test...but the gluten parts are still in the beer. I don't fully understand the science, but if there are parts of gluten present, it seems like misrepresented marketing to me??? Bards is made with malted sorghum (which doesn't contain gluten) and not wheat or barley (which contain gluten) like many beers. Looks like AB has a gluten-free sorghum beer too but it is made with a syrup and not the malted grain...we all know how important malting is to the beer's taste!

My body feels so much healthier as I eliminate and reduce the gluten in my diet and am glad that I found Bards. I'm looking forward to drinking more Bards in the near future!",4.5

If this is all I get: fail. I picture that guy in the Matrix, wanting to think that daily mush is a steak. Well, it ain't; no blue pill proffered.

Specifics:

No head or gone to nada before I noticed. Smells beery, in a lager kind of way. Looks like a lager. But tastes like something new, however not, importantly, beer. Almost cider I suppose, but I like cider. Not cider either. Sorghum ""beer"" is its own thing.

There is an aftertaste, which I guess is the sorghum. Or rather, It's like an after-sweetness, and also this slippery after-mouthfeel--like you went to the wrong sushi bar and maybe it's time to get worried.

Appearance (2.5): Very small, short-lived head on this, snow-white and starting around half a centimeter thick. No fingers to measure this one—this beer is fingerless. Some lacing, actually. The body is a pale yellow, and clear. Well, at least there’s some sudsy lace.

Smell (1.5): Kind of smells like the water cup at a beer pong table: vaguely beer-like, but mostly water. Some very plain barley scent that might be most accurately measured in parts per million. Some sweet corn? I suppose the lowest score would be if it legitimately smelled bad, but this just doesn’t smell like anything to speak of.

Taste (1.5): Following the nose, this is more of a palate cleanser than anything else. It’s got a strange aftertaste though, like unflavored grits mixed with some overcooked vegetables. There is just the GHOST of a hint of bitterness in the finish, vaguely herbal and vegetal. I’d love to say that it has a distinct pilsner yeast note, but it simply doesn’t.

Mouthfeel (2.0): Well, there is some carbonation. It’s low-key, fizzy, and dies quickly, though. What this beer DOES have going for it is quenching-ness. It’s very light, goes down easy, and I suppose it has a somewhat dry finish, for lack of sweetness or viscosity.

Overall (2.0): Can I give this a 1.75? This is definitely not a good beer, and not a good representation of the style, either. To be perfectly honest, with this little taste, body, and feel, I’m shocked that it even retains 5% ABV. That said, the beer was meant to be light, inoffensive, and drank in large quantities, all of which it achieves without much trouble. It’s not the worst of the worst—that would be a slushy of Classic Ice, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, and Rogue Chipotle—but it does not stand out in any way, whatsoever, and is forgettable at best. Don’t get me wrong, I can dig a good AAL once in a while. But even in terms of the Brazilian market, with which I consider myself relatively familiar, this is far from anything notable.",2.0

Minhas Light,Just a light beer. 2010/09/06,2.25
Minhas Light,Blech.,1.5
Minhas Light,"Poured from a can into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a light golden color with a fizzy white head. The head fades super fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell –The aroma of the brew is mostly of a corn smell mixed with a little bit of a musty aroma.

Taste-The taste begins with a sweeter corn syrup taste mixed with a little bit of a grain. As the taste moves on some lighter flavors of caramel and even more corn come to the tongue. In the end one is left with a somewhat more sweet corn cereal taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is very thin and light with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thin body is prime for the sweeter and subdued tastes of the brew. A little higher carbonation would have been slightly better for the lightness of the brew, but even so, the feel was alright overall.

Overall – For a 4% abv. brew that clocks in at only ~95 calories I am not going to expect a flavor powerhouse. Nothing is really off in the taste, but nothing is really on either. It is sort a standard light brew overall.",2.5

Minhas Light,Well....better than bud light and quite honestly if u drink light beer this is a good alternative to the big brand guys it has better flavor and ur paying 9.50$ for 24 beers,2.25
Minhas Light,"Appearance - Light yellow. Very clear and very bubbly. Short and very short-lived sudsy white head.

Smell - Light and very sweet pale malts. Corn and candy.

Taste - Sweet and corny, but obviously quite light. Light pale malts with no apparent hops character. Slight metallic tang and a little bit of a cloying aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - Light and crisp.

Overall - Pretty inoffensive and refreshing. Judging by some of Minhas' other efforts, this could be much worse. As is, it's a decent low priced stand in for the more flavorful of the macrolager lights.",3.5
Minhas Light,"Bought a case a few weeks ago. It was cheap and I didn't really want to spend too much on beer at the time. 10 dollars for a 30 pack, will do.

Not even going to pour this into a glass, it's not worth it.

Smell: Very fruity. That's about all I get. Fruitiness and maybe the slightest bit of a used up hop smell.

Taste: Well, it's light alright. Water, fruit, corn, and a ghosting of stale hops. Can't really expect too much from this.

Mouthfeel: Decently carbonated and very thin. Watery the whole way through. It goes down very easy to say the least.

Overall, it's not vomitrocious. It's not good either. I can't say I will be picking this one up again.",2.0
Minhas Light,"So it was $2.29 for a 6 pack. Decided to take a shot with the goading of my co-worker.

Pours super pale yellow, huge head that actually leaves a bit of lacing on the plastic hotel cup (I'm classy fuck you).

Smell is um..not pleasant. something offputting about it. Not beery at all.

Taste is, well I've had worse, tastes like a macro light, no worse than Bud light and a crap load cheaper.

Mouthfeel is water, strike that, it's carbonated water. Kinda like H2OH, if you've ever had that.

Drinkability. I've already 4 in, and have one more to finish, along with 2 more New Glarus, the fact that I can still type after 10 beers in the last hour says to me that it is pretty sessionable. Not that it tastes good, but at this point I'm really not getting the full flavor, and it hasn't made me puke yet, so bottoms up.

In short, cheap beer, not objectionable if you are just looking to get hammered in the cheapest way possible and you have something against malt liquor. But if you want beer, then don't buy this.",2.0
Minhas Light,"Bought a case of this (24pack) for 5 bucks... hard to beat that!

A- Pale yellow, a bit of fizzy head that immediately reduces to nothing.

S- Doesn't smell like much.. Maybe a bit of hops mixed with lots of water..

T- Tastes just like it smells... like water and bit of sweetness coming from something. The good news is it doesn't leave too much of an aftertaste.

M- The mouthfeel? Put water in your mouth and see for yourself.

D- This beer is pretty sessionable for me. While I dont think the taste is great, the lack of a bad aftertaste is a plus for me, and I have no problem throwing 10-15 of these back in a night. I can't say the same about some other macro brews.

If you are looking for the cheapest reasonable beer possible to get drunk, I'd recommend Minhas. It definitely isn't any worse than your typical Macro brews, but about a third of the price. If you are looking for good beer, avoid at all costs.",3.5
Minhas Light,"The CANQuest (TM) rolls on, thanks to my having gotten the hang of resizing photos for submission. I have a bunch of CANs that I was holding in abeyance until I could get a picture uploaded since they look better unopened, IMHO. This was one of them. CAN you dig it?

From the CAN: ""Brewing beer in Monroe, Wisconsin comes naturally. Since 1846, our brewmasters have handcrafted premium beer from only the finest natural ingredients - a proud tradition that continues to this day.""; ""Calories 97, Carbohydrates 3.6g, Protein 0.73g, Fat 0g"". I include these stats because although the CANs look very similar, this is NOT Minhas 75.

The Crack & Glug produced two fingers' worth of fizzy bone-white head that burbled and popped its way out of existence. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with the barest hint of a chill haze. Bear in mind that when I type ""pale"", we are talking REALLY light in this case. Nose had that now-familiar Minhas grape bubble gum odor that seems to be a product of whatever poor yeast strain they have overworked to the point of near death. Mouthfeel was thin, not quite watery, and with a taste like drying tobacco in the mouth. It was almost passable if you like that sort of sweetish smell and taste. Finish reminded me of my youth when we used to chew tobacco, especially Red Man. I gave that stuff up a long time ago and CANnot recommend either it or this to others. Minhas!",1.5

Tecate Original,"Poured from a 32oz bottle best by November 2022.

On the pour a fizzy one finger head forms then dissipates relatively quickly leaving a ring around the glass amd some light bubbles floating on top. It looks quite light, with a not quite yellow light straw colored body and streams of lively carbonation. Brilliantly clear.

Aroma is largely corny malt, with a hit of slightly skunked hops on the back end. The hops are actually detectable which for the style is nice. Slightly funky from the skunk but it sort of brings the mexican beer vibe and some hop aroma is still intact.

Flavor follows the aroma with a bit of a mineral hard water taste on the front that quickly morphs into a corny malty lightly bitter but smooth ""beer flavor"". Quite crisp despite the hint of skunk and the malts are quite prominent with a corny but not syrupy sweetness that leaves you feeling refreshed but like you're drinking real beer.

Feel is a bit light and watery with a decent carbonation bite before the head builds up and gives a bit of texture. Doesn't feel very big but that makes it quite refreshing. I just wish it was a little less watery, but the strong malt flavor makes up for it.

Overall one of my favorite Mexican lagers solely for the flavor. Cheap beer either gets the feel right or the flavor right and this one almost nailed the flavor, unlike most American beers which go only for a good feel. This one is a bit light but actually tastes quite nice.",3.0

Tecate Original,"Tecate is crystal clear, and the color of ripe hay, much like any mainstream lager. The head is cloudy, bone white, and shows decent retention.

At first blush, Tecate smells of white bread and soda crackers. From there, the aroma thins out somewhat, initially leaning more towards the aroma of soda cracker. In the middle, the nose becomes more neutral, lacking the roundness you might find in European pilsners. The finish offers hints of leafiness and fresh cut grass, indicating use of European hops, at least.

On the tongue, Tecate starts out smooth, and light in body. Malt profile makes itself known in the form of soda crackers, and yesterday's biscuits. In the center there's just a hint of green apple tartness, although still none of the rounded quality of a European pilsner. The finish is European enough, giving me hop flavors in the form of peppercorns and dried leafiness.

It's not a world class lager by any means. But it is crisp, light in body, and completely refreshing. And that is in large part what you pay a lager to be on a hot, summer day.",3.0
Tecate Original,"The contents of two 12 ounce cans were combined until a clear glass Imperial pint mug was filled. The beer is a bright and very lightly colored amber, almost as clear as seltzer water. A slight head occurred during the pour, but there's very little within a minute or so. It's almost odorless, unlike some American Adjuncts which at least throw a little malty sweetness or a little yeast toward the nose. There is far more glass lacing than there is taste. But, it's not all bad. Somehow the malt that doesn't show in the taste, creates a pleasantly bodied brew. This isn't malty to taste, so it is in good balance with the very mild dose of hops. Perhaps, under the right circumstances, this might pass as an acceptable session beer.",2.75

Carling Black Label,"Happy CANada Day, hosers! Take off, eh? This is one of my FAVORITE holidays of the year since it provides me with the impetus to a) drink CANned CANadian beer ISO The CANQuest (tm); b) watch hockey (either pre-recorded games or movies, like ""Slapshot""; c) watch ""Strange Brew""; d) eat some beaver & e) parade nekkid in the street while waving a CANdian flag. 2017 was their 150th Anniversary so I pulled out all of the stops, using sparklers & firecrackers as accoutrements, which was attention-getting, to say the least. The local CANstabulary was bemused & amused as they led me away, but I was less-than-thrilled with the 1st & 2nd degree burns, especially to my sensitive bits! Needless to say, I have scaled back since then.

A BIG ""THANK YOU!"" to my local, in-person trading partner, @tone77 , for providing me with a buncha beers for today's CANebration! He said that many of them will take me back to the early days of The CANQuest (tm), when AALs were the standard & the norm. No matter! Today, we CANebrate & inebriate! Cheers to our CANuck neighbors!

This beer really takes me back. It was ~ 1969 & my late-Pops was a hardcore unionist working at the now-defunct ALCOA plant. A strike was in the offing & so a meeting was held at my parents' house to decide a course of action. My 'rents, while not teetotalers, were not big imbibers so alcohol consumption was kind of a rarity. I was ~ 4 y/o at the time & curious, so when somebody offered me a sip from their CAN of Carling Black Label, Pops nodded in assent & I partook for the first time in my life. I CAN only remember being astounded by the bitterness of the hops just before I dropped the CAN from my hands, spilling it all over the carpet. Uproarious laughter ensued, except from Pops, who promptly escorted me to bed. LOL.

I had ""O CANada"" playing on YouTube as I Crack!ed open the vent to begin this momentous CANebration.

This reminds me of another story. I was a Plankowner aboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) in 1989 & when we opened the Staten Island Naval Shipyard in late-1990, I was a fixture at Rangers games @MSG. It was easy - flash my active duty ID, pay a pittance & sit in the infamous Blue Seats where the action happened. Beer was a given & if I got there early enough to where they were not sold out, a potato knish. Profanity was the native tongue up there & cocaine was openly snorted, but those are tales for another time. On this night, the TOR Maple Leafs were in town, necessitating the singing of both the U.S. & CANadian national anthems. I know the latter in both English et Français so I was singing along when I suddenly registered the voices behind me. Right tune, wrong words, or so I thought. After the anthems were done & we were seated, I donned my Curious Cat suit & turned to ask the guys behind me as to what had transpired. They were Spanish-speaking Latinos of Puerto RiCAN descent who had grown up in Hell's Kitchen & were lifelong Rangers fans. They had been to so many games that they sing the national anthems in SPANISH! I sat back, flabbergasted.

Onward! I went with a nice, free-flowing Glug since this was such an auspicious ocCANsion, leading to the foamy formation of two-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, rocky-bone-(Great) white (North) head, but with only moderate retention. 8=( Color was a pretty Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with CANadian-quality clarity & now The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus appeared to join the CANadian CANebration! Whotta party. Nose was actually not bad, when rating to style.

The adjunct that mars most, if not all, AALs is the inclusion of corn. I have loved Fritos corn chips since Kindergarten when I first had them as a snack, but I do NOT like the taste of corn in beer. It is an extender that traces its roots to illicit beer being made during Prohibition when anything & everything was fair game as far as ingredients were CANcerned.

Yes, there was a corn aspect to the nose, but I have encountered FAR worse with some like opening a bag of the aforementioned Fritos! 8=p This was on the low end of that f**ked-up spectrum. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was more innocuous than anything else. It was light in flavor to the point that adjuncts were more of an afterthought than something with which to be CANcerned. I was kind of surprised at just how flavorless this seemed to me to be. My palate, as a self-avowed, self-described hophead, seemed to have evolved to the point that AALs are rendered simply ethereal. Not bad, just not destined for Guy Fieri's ""Flavortown"". Finish was crisp, dry & refreshing on this hot, hazy, humid CANada Day, which is just what they were shooting for. Sure, it's a flawed beer, but the style itself is flawed. Remember, Rate to Style & NOT to Taste, boys & girls!",3.5

Mickey's,"Just got back from my local beer emporium with a 6-pack of this classic college-boy swill. Still in the green glass ""hand grenade"" bottles I remember from the 70's. I poured a bottle into a pint-size German lager glass I've got which is one of my favorites to use in looking at, smelling, and tasting beers as it has a wide mouth. The beer starts off fairly well: nice amber color with a decent amount of foam and a floral smell. About half-way through the glass though I notice a creeping metallic taste, faint at first then becoming more pronounced toward the bottom. Also present is a kind of disagreeable syrupy sweet mouth, (the corn syrup adjunct perhaps?) with a faint overtone of skunkiness.

Overall, not a beer I would particularly recommend to anyone I like. Back in the Old Days was often consumed with copious amounts of the ""Devil's Lettuce"" so that might have affected my taste and memory of the brew. I'll try it again in a day or two and see if my opinion changes. As malt liquor beers go, probably as good or better than most.",2.0
Mickey's,"Crystal clear yellow-gold, ample carbonation, but my pour started out too gentle and even though I poured the last 2/3 quite vigorously, it still only garnered a short white head that disappeared in a minute or so. Some lacing as I tip the glass. I thought about just chugging it from the wide-mouth bottle for more authenticity, but instead I used the closest glassware I have to what I remember from the dive bars in the 60s - a sham pilsner glass.

Aroma is not bad at all. Kind of nice, actually, if not too strong. Bready and grainy with hints of fruit.

The initial swig starts with an impression of a taste that is, well, interesting. The grain from the aroma is more prominent in the initial sip. The middle picks up some sweet corn flavors, perhaps honey, with the finish and aftertaste being bread doughy with a mellow, doughy, aftertaste. If there is any bitterness there, I almost have to imagine it. IOW, it is quite mild. While my initial impression of the taste was ""interesting"" (Minnesota-speak for a ""nice"" way of avoiding stating an opinion), the flavor did grow on me, even by the finish of that initial sip, and it continues to does grow on me the more I drink. I actually am enjoying this, and could see pounding a few in a summer afternoon on the deck.

Mouth feel is medium to thin bodied, more substantial than most AALs.

Overall, as I stated, I quite enjoyed it. The only format I could find was the six pack of 12 ounce bottles, and I won't have any problem wanting to finish the rest.",3.75
Mickey's,"Purchased a 6 pack of hand grenades at a neighborhood liquor store for too much money ($8.99)
On the pour it's beautiful fine 1 finger head, effervescent bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass for at least 10 minutes now, standard lager color nothing wierd. Even forms pretty good lacing as I drink.

Smell on the other hand is malt liquor, not appealing almost tart, but not as bad as old english kinda just smells like old beer and yeast maybe a little metallic.

Taste brings some redemption from the smell, not necessarily smooth but theres almost a hint of banana flavor but there is a little bit of that tart off note from the smell but not nearly as intense. Then it fades into a grainy almost grape nut cereal taste that leaves you feeling warmer than most mass produced ""lagers"" out there. Still very sweet and corny though.

Feel is a bit heavy to be a drinking and working beer but good for relaxing if you're not feeling like spending much money but want a little more flavor.

Light grain taste; light corn; light hop bitterness; clean. Medium body; nice residual sugar mouthfeel, soft; delicate warmth permeates the beer.

I'm not sure why there is a lot of dislike for this beer. It's at the low-end, ABV_wise, of being a malt liquor, yet it comes across balanced and relatively complex for an adjunct lager.

Mickey's,"The Legendary Mickey's Malt Liquor. My first go round with this beverage. Didn't want to use a glass because I love the big mouth bottle, but I decided to pour it for the sake of a review.

Semi-aggressive pour has the malt liquor foam up out of the glass a bit.

Settles to a 2 finger pure white head on top of a nice looking gold body.

Can't quite put my finger on what the smell is, but it's not good.

Taste is sweet, corn, finishing with a bit of a metallic twang.

Feel...not much.

Extra Dry,"Tooheys Extra Dry, or TEDs as they're colloquially known in Australia, is a well known mass produced adjunct lager, that had its heyday in the early to mid 2000s. Originally brewed at 5%, it's alcohol content has decreased significantly to 4.4%. Once a popular beer amongst teenagers and young adults looking for a quick easy buzz it was marketed as an easy drinking lager, and gained notoriety with music festivals and outdoor events. Nowadays, it's less popular, and Tooheys are attempting to revive it, by playing on it's declining popularity with a marketing campaign of being 'proudly ordinary'.

Look: Standard Aussie mass produced adjunct lager look to it. Golden hue, medium size head, soap sudsy looking which disappated quickly to a white bubbling slick. It's an Aussie lager, it looks pretty standard.

Smell: Classic Aussie adjunct lager smell. Grainy, faint fruity hop aroma. Bready yeast, a little chemically, almost like a citrus air freshener. A little bit of egg white.

Taste: Sweet maltiness, slight fruitiness. Not overly bitter. light graininess . The dryness lingers in the palate, and tastes a bit chemically. Quite bland even for an Aussie adjunct lager.

Feel: Light, refreshing when ice-cold, highly carbonated. Tastes like a beer that you're going to knock back several of without really caring about what you're drinking. You're drinking it for the buzz it will eventually give you if you knock back enough of them.

Overall: I like many Australians drank a fair bit of this back in the day when we were young, dumb and thinking we were cool. I remember many a headache afterwards, and associated nasty hangovers with this stuff. I must say, it certainly isn't as good as it once was, and the fact that Tooheys are advertising it as 'proudly ordinary' is really all that needs to be said about TEDs. It's an ordinary beer. Nothing fancy, it's not trying to be stylish. It's there to serve a purpose, and not to be savoured. Although I don't know how much longer than can keep marketing this when they keep knocking down the ABV. It's going to be mid-strength the way it's going before too long, following in the footsteps of the Carlton Cold.",2.25

Molson XXX,This was not awful! Alcohols was well hidden despite cheap ingredients. Mostly inoffensive nose of malt and corn. Flavors similar with some bready notes similar to Molson Golden. I would have another of these for sure in a pinch.,2.75
Molson XXX,"Got a 12 oz bottle of this for free recently. Poured into one of my pint glasses, this pours a very clear, medium golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles continuously and rapidly rising to the surface. Has a nice white head that's an inch thick when first poured that settles to a very thick surface coating and a very thick ring lining the inside of the glass and decent lacing. Head settles eventually to a nice film layer of surface foam and there is some pretty good lacing in the inside of the glass too after a few sips. Aromas of some bready malt sweetness along w/ what's likely corn and rice and not much else. Not the best aroma by any means, but not unpleasant or offensive either. The taste is pretty much the same, some bready, malt sweetness followed by rice and corn and just a slight hint of hop bitterness. As I get a few more sips into this and as this starts to warm up a bit, I'm starting to taste an unpleasant grassy, cardboard, metallic bitter like off flavor of some sort. Also a touch of hops. Has a crisp and also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel w/ moderate carbonation. That unpleasant grassy, metallic bitterness taste lingers on my palate after each sip. I'm not even going to finish this one.

Molson XXX,"Another review from April 2017, screw top Molson. I don't even remember how I came across this.

Looks like we've been designated as a malt liquor. Ok, so I'm guessing they went with corn to bump this abv up to get placed in this category. Ok, never found Molson to be all super grain 100% barley feels anyways.

Pours the most common color appearance of anything under the rubric of beer, golden, good clarity, 1/3"" white head with poor retention. Aroma of well, malt liquor frankly, corn and rubbing alcohol.

Yeah, taste is largely fueled almost fusel like fueled with some sharp booziness. Big carbonation. Not much for taste here, a stinging booze, mild high alpha acids, mostly corn notes, you'd have to search for something resembling a grain malt bill. I'm not saying regular Molson is all that, but its better than this. Its like they just wanted to amp the abv up and took the cheapest way of doing it. I dunno, it looks decent, and the carbonation and body are light, but you really gotta drink this one super cold to avoid the alcohol bite and sting.",2.75
Molson XXX,"I expected a lot more from this one. A dark yellow pour with minimal head. Scent is a mix of malt, alcohol and some hop bitterness.

An aftertaste that is unfortunately dominated by an unappetizing metallic taste",2.25

Molson XXX,"I am by no means a beer snob. In fact, I truly enjoy discovering diamonds in the rough amongst even the cheapest most overlooked macros. Many of them are remarkably smooth and imminently drinkable. You can casually drink them without noticing or being unavoidably reminded that you have sacrificed a great deal of quality for a very low price. Molson XXX is a beer that you can't sip casually and forget what you are drinking. It's the kind of beer that will have you looking at the glass with a furled brow, puzzled and disgusted each time you take a sip as if you might somehow be able to tangibly see the reason for and cause of your displeasure.

24 oz. tall can purchased from a Kroger store in East Atlanta for around $1.40. Poured cold into Weizen glass. Decent frothy head that subsides rather quickly to leave behind a watery almost non-existant lacing with no noticeable bubble strands flowing upward after about 2 or 3 minutes. The look is quite flat and watery, and color is much darker than I was expecting. Almost a light rust colored hue. Certainly not a classic bright yellow golden straw color.

Smell is not too terrible, although slightly perfumey. Undertones of saturated wheat, yeast and stale grains. Otherwise smell is somewhat nondescript. Judging by the smell, I was expecting a sweeter tasting maltier beer than what it actually is.

Taste is immediately offputting. The alcohol taste is overpowering and readily apparent. If I didnt know better i might think this was spiked with rubbing alcohol to achieve the 8% mark boasted on the can. You immediately know you are drinking an 8% and the alcohol is not nicely tucked away and understated like it is in some other high gravity contemporaries. I dont think the bitterness in this brew is coming from hops, but something else entirely, and I would describe the taste more as a dark sour than a bitterness. But even sour is too nice of a word to describe the taste of this beer. Absolutely foul. Dirty metallic spicy copper immediately assaults the tongue, and the aftertaste is similarly wretched making this beer damn near undrinkable.

Mouthfeel and consistency are also poor. Watery, although there is some slight spicy carbonation that trickles down the throat. Noticeable alcohol afterburn going down, that makes it difficult to discern if the burn is from carbonation or just alcohol. Somehow syrupy thick and watery thin at the same time. Truly a paradox, but not one that has you looking up at the stars pondering the complexities of existence, more of disappointed perplexed feeling of how is this possible. And why? Just why. Consistency of saliva coupled with the detestably offputting flavor makes for a truly terrible combination.

Trying to finish a glass of this is a difficult and unenjoyable endeavor. I want to hang on and finish this to give it an honest evaluation from start to finish, but it gets more disgusting and unpalatable with every sip, even given the best possible treatment, perfectly poured in a chilled Weizen glass.

Much Like Icehouse Edge, this beer took a basic smooth and simple template and crammed as much alcohol into it as possible through obvious adjuncts, leading to a grossly imbalanced final product. I dont mind tastefully balanced adjunct lagers at all, in fact in may cases I actually prefer them. But in Molson XXX, it is too obvious that the adjuncts selected were chosen specifically to raise the alcohol content and nothing else. There was no attention paid to smoothness, flavor or drinkability and instead of raising the alcohol content in proportion to the body and flavor of the beer, the alcohol outpaces Molson XXX's meager frame in all respects, pushing any redeeming qualities this beer might have far into the background, vastly overshadowed by an imbalanced, disgusting alcohol taste.

Overall, I was very disappointed, even though my expectations werent high going in, for a cheap high gravity gas station malt liqour, but I have had many others in this category that outperform this in every way. I expected more from our Canadian northerly neighbors. Perhaps this beer is designed with the sole purpose of warming you up in sub zero Canadian temps with an affordable alcohol content, but there are far more efficient and enjoyable vehicles for achieving this objective, even at this rock bottom price point. I found this to be in perhaps the bottom 3 of any beer I have ever tried. Hurricane high gravity is the worst beer I have ever tried, and if given the choice only between these 2, I'm really not sure which I would rather suffer through.

A truly miserable brew that exaggerates and accentuates all the negative stereotypes of cheap malt liquor, and then some. This beer should be completely avoided unless you are already 7-8 in and are just looking for a cheap nightcap to finish you off . Perhaps then you may not notice just how awful it really is, but again there are much better options to achieve this objective at the same price or less.",1.25

Molson XXX,"I got this from a beer store in London, Ontario whilst there for my son's hockey tournament. It poured a clear golden with no head and no lace. The scent had grain presence.

Molson XXX,"24 Oz can poured into glass
Look - like any average beer, maybe a tad bit more amber color with some foam not much lacing
Smell - Not a whole lot there, smells like a malty bread beer. Mostly grainy not much bitterness or sweetness detected.
Taste - Sweet. Fairly sweet malt and do pick up some of the alcohol which is to be expected. It has a sour profile almost like sourdough bread, not totally unpleasant but not great either. Not too much bitterness although it settles in after a while. I would say an IPA is a mix of bitter vs. sweet but this is a balance of sour vs. sweet. I don't particularly love the style and so that plays a part in my rating, it just doesn't taste all that great or satisfying, although if your plan is to get buzzed then this is fine. Prickly carbonation but that is consistent with Molson.

Molson XXX,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. A 2"" sudsy white head drops slowly with some mild lacing. Color is slightly hazy gold with plenty of streaming carbonation.

Overall: it is a bit cloying and sweet, but that is not unusual for the style.",3.25
Molson XXX,"The clear deep golden yellow colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1/2” white head that recedes slowly but visibly and leaves an ring of irregular patches of foam around the glass and a thin irregular island of foam on the surface. Eventually there are only a few patches of lacing on the sides. Sipping creates a couple of sheets of lacing that turn into small scattered patches of lacing that mostly recede to the surface of the liquid.

The aromas are mostly about the malt but there’s noticeable corn here as well. The hops are slightly grassy and in the background.

As expected from the nose, the flavors are mostly about the bready, crackery malt and corn sweetness. There’s also some grainy character from the corn and just a hint of grassy bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable but not unpleasant.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp with the finely bubbled, moderate and persistent carbonation. The medium length finish begins as the malty, grainy sweetness begins to fade to a slightly grassy, almost bitter and semi-dry ending.

Keeping style in mind, this is a reasonably tasty and drinkable malt liquor with a moderately high ABV and easy to drink. That said I’ll not be seeking out more in the future but only because I prefer a bit more hop flavor and bitterness from the hops.",3.75

It did have a sort of a weird smell that made me think I might be drinking something possibly sweet but once it hitmy tongue all that disappeared.
The only thing impressive about this is that it would make a decent beer to serve for the purposes of a movie that required a bubbly drink with a thick head.

Pale amber body color, hints of red and pale orange with a very nice clarity. Minimal carbonation through the body with a creamy to fairly bright white two finger head. A bit of staying power, as it slowly settles to a thin puck and collar.

Aroma is slightly a mix of good and bad. Floury and pasty malts, hints of straight DME, and a faint touch of grass like quality. Light touch of caramel sweetness, but also a bit of a chalky quality.

Palate is a bit of a surprise. A pretty decent body on this, with touches of light malt sweetness that doesn't go overboard. Clean finish with a pretty simple malt character. There's a bit of carbonation almost mineral quality but the body is big enough to cut through it to not be distracting.

Old Milwaukee Light,Old Mil has a beer I drank when I was in college because of the price when I was in college was 9 bucks a case and as I have got older its made a resurgence in my area after being on a single case stack at the local beer store they now carry it by the pallet. This beer is extremely smooth and to many drinkers tastes like beer nothing offensive but does not blow you away. can basically copy and paste this to the Old MIl premium but no point to go with premium due to no noticeable taste difference and just higher calories. EDIT REVIEW. this beer has replaced Busch Light as my go to beer combination of flavor and cost. There is a reason that this product has won so many award and is the most award winning light beer regardless of hipsters and fanboys wanting to trash it because it is a (Cheaper) beer. People need to realize that just because a beer costs more does not mean it is better.,3.25
Old Milwaukee Light,"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 9/23/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.8%. Overall this is a very nice light adjunct lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Nice clean pils malt/grain showcase, with great earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. One of the best macro light lagers I've had as expected of Pabst.",3.5
Old Milwaukee Light,I usually drink labatt light blue. Royal or Milwaukee's best light but old Milwaukee light was 50 cents cheaper than the best light. I tried it nice clean sweet taste. It didnt have foam overkill like best light overall a much better buy than bud light miller light or Coors light best bang for the buck,4.75

Old Milwaukee Light,"From notes taken 09/24/17:

Very pale and clear straw gold. Lemon-white cap of fine, uneven fluff, with surprisingly good retention. Nose is faint lemon, sweet not sour, pinch of yeast, some grass. Light grain palate, adjunct but not distractingly so. No honey suggestions, which is good. Overall, like mineral water with a few drops of lemon and melon juice. Pretty standard fare, refreshing enough, light in body, with tight spritzy carbonation.",2.5
Old Milwaukee Light,"An hour before my buddy's wedding in Bascom, OH this week, I decided more ""emergency"" beer was needed for possible late night. So I ran down the road to Tiffin to pick somehing up and this was what I ended up with. I was going to do the regular Old Mil but they only had thirty packs and that seemed excessive.

This is incredibly bland and flavorless but also overcarbonated and watery. Fine for easy pounding but not something worth looking out for.",2.5

Old Milwaukee Light,"Im embarrassed to say this, but this beer is actually a great tasting light beer. Who knew? It's got a clean taste with no tinny or weird aftertaste.

Don't be embarrassed like I've been, pick some of this up, it's actually better than most of the more expensive mass produced light beers. True Story!",4.75
Old Milwaukee Light,"Super light yellow aal light beer kinda thing going, solid white head, almost average retention. Aroma was just industrial beer smells, aluminum, corn.

Taste, super carbonated, light noble hop, almost no barley content. Super watery mouthfeel. Even though its really lightly hopped flavor wise, the lack of a malt body allows a distinct, soapy bitterness to jump around. High alpha acid hops and a super long boil = less hops to pay for.",2.25

Old Milwaukee Light,"Picked up a 15 case of these naughty puppies in cans. If Old Mil itself is any indication, these aren't going to be much better. Tossed it in the fridge, kudos to my staff discount, and proceeded to pound one back with some leftover Chinese take out. Taste is of air. Nothing. A hint of hops that teases you and then withdraws completely like a hooker who realizes you've only got spare change in the ashtray of your car. That's about it. No smell, nada. This is a working man's beer, without a doubt. I sell a ton of Old Mil each day and mostly to contractors or site workers. This stuff only sells when someone comes in specifically looking for it. People are more than happy to take any number of light beers over this stuff.

Can is pretty righteous. The girl is a lot hotter than the regular Old Mil pinup so that's a definite plus. Easy to drink, hard to taste. I don't mind it. I'm not buying this for the taste. I'm buying it because if I don't, it'll hang around my cooler until it expires like all of my Labatt Blue. Let's all be honest here. Light beer is meant for those who don't want a beer gut and a stained, yellowed tank top as their main piece of attire. This cannot be rated as thoroughly as a craft beer. This is a domestic, light, canned beer produced for the masses, not small batch brewed to a 700 year old tradition or some nonsense. For what it is, it's still crap, though.",2.0
Foster's Lager,"2003: (330 ml bottle, ABV 4.5%): Light golden colour, large head that doesn't last long. Initial fresh Heineken-like aroma that doesn't linger, bland watery flavour, aftertaste has a little strange and unpleasant bitterness in the end. So boring they could have named it ""Neville Chamberlain"".",2.5
Foster's Lager,"25oz can

Pours over a finger of pillowy, slightly fizzy white head into my Kolsch glass. Retention is decent for a macro, the head hangs around a minute or two, but surely fades soon enough. Initial lacing actually looks ok as well.

Nose is pretty standard, light malt, corn, some sweetness.

Flavor has some light maltiness, faint corn, very one dimensional. No hop flavor to speak of, but what do you expect? That said, it's actually not bad, pretty clean.

Carbonation is on the higher side. Light, but has a little body. Not bone dry like some lagers, this has a little sweetness to it. Bitterness is barely there. Overall a serviceable mouthfeel.

Drinkability is great.

Appearance turned out ok. Lacing just barely held on.

This isn't exceptional, but ""clean"" is ahead of the curve for a macro. Overall it's unoffensive and easy drinking. Not bad.",3.5

Foster's Lager,"750 ml can poured into a tumbler style pint glass.

Foster's Lager,"750ml can

This is the beer I used to steal from my dad when I was [REDACTED] years old, grabbing out of the minifridge while controlling each smooth muscle movement as to not let any sound penetrate up into the upper caverns of my old suburban household. It was just okay back then, now it is pretty awful, caramel malts that are astringent and slick on the tongue, basically tastes like grain and cheap cereal, along with a half shot of even cheaper vodka. Ugh",2.75
Foster's Lager,"Not sure why but the name and look really speak to me. Also it’s Australian so that’s cool. Just looks like an old oil can or what I assume they used to look like. Either way, I approve even if it’s just an adjunct, if your drunk enough anything will taste good.

Edit: good is comparative, it taste like oily sandy mud but much better than many other adjuncts. Also cool can.",3.5

Foster's Lager,Pretty solid. Would drink again. Malty and sweet. Almost no bitterness. Not nearly as bad as I expected.,3.0
Foster's Lager,This beer I liked early on until I realized all the stuff in it like corn syrup,2.0
Foster's Lager,"Look is very good for an adjunct 3ish finger head on first pour out of the 750mL can. Laces when I drink pretty well and is a darker straw color but still pretty pale.

Smell gives away some macro properties and has an odd metallic off smell, but the malt comes through, the off smell could be the hops but other than that no standard hop smell detected.

The taste is mild sweet and grainy in a good way if you like malts with a hint of hop bitterness befor the sweet finale, but again the hops are just hinted at.

Feel is smooth and soft, easy to drink, but clearly not light. Very foamy once you sip but in a good way, not overwhelming.

Overall it's good for the price point, about 3 bucks at a neighborhood liquor store. For the only way to get it being in a single 750ml can it's pretty good, but still not super interesting. I would drink again every few months for the novelty of the can.",3.25
Foster's Lager,"750ml can into a tall glass. Best by 2/28/22, so plenty fresh.

Looks nice enough, though pours a little syrupy. Crystal clear pale golden yellow body with good carbonation. Small white head retains well, a little lacing.

Unpleasant perfume/floral aroma.

On tasting, sweet, malty, drying, none of which is in a good way.

Mouth medium, finish initially sweet, then turns a nasty light bitterness.

Overall, while better than many of this style, still not something to be repeated.",2.5

L - Gigantic can aside, it pours a pale amber. Half-finger pale ginger head that dissipates extremely fast.
S - Sweetness. Wheat and corn, a bit of rice, and grass. Not very complex, but not exactly offensive.
T - Tastes like it smells. Relatively sweet, with a strong general grain backing. A bit of a green tea note.
F - Very refreshing. Light carbonation. Easy to drink.
O - As far as single cans go, this is the best bang-for-the-buck you can find at a gas station. Easy to drink, hits the spot on a hot day, and is a relatively inoffensive brew. It's like the Aussie Budweiser. This being said, I've had better beers for cheaper. Taking into account what it's trying to be, it's not bad. Could be better, but not bad.

Iron City Beer,"(16 oz can, 0391 2002; purchased cold sixer from Mineo's Pizza in Pittsburgh... poured into my newly-acquired 9 oz Genesee taster glass... reviewed from the Cortland Motel, Cortland, NY)

L: crystal-clear, pale bronze colored liquid; persistent white cap... collar keeps; laces a bit

S: caramel cookie hot from the pop, kinda Dortmunder golden... corn muffin develops and persists; great presence

T: dry underbelly up front, but expansive, apple tart overtone rushing out... the corn kernel soon takes shape - Miller-like, but more overtly, brashful-y corny - and provides a surprising dimension and depth to its basic

F: slippery, silky smooth texture; mild rolling viscosity; subtle acidic-biting carbonation... perhaps a touch too much plush up front for some; ultimately dynamic and stimulating... certainly appropriately cut and dry

O: their IC light, which I had at a Bucs game a couple nights ago, bore a diluted resemblance to this, but maintained that grainy overbite... pretty solid adjuncted lager, tickling my cornhole, light but greasy... happy with the purchase, and drafting a raincheck for a revisit (1795)",4.25

Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,"Clear dark amber with a small ivory head that vanishes in a blink.
The aroma is sweet caramel malt and hints of cheap whiskey or rum, some grassy notes.
The taste is also sweet caramel malt and brown sugar or molasses with rum, plenty of alcohol taste and burn. The finish is still sticky sweet with rum notes and just a hint of grassy hops.
The body is full and a bit oily, light carbonation.
Altogether my first problem is rating this as any kind of pilsner, it just does not resemble any pilsner I've ever had. It is more like an extra strength barleywine or maybe a ""boilermaker"". Whatever it is, it is drinkable and packs a pretty good punch for the price. If that's what you are looking for, this is for you.",2.5

Let me tell you maybe the bad reviews are due to drinking this too fresh or in the wrong glass or the wrong temperature or improper storage, I don't know. But I am drinking a bottle right now that has aged gracefully for 14 years and reminds me of nothing more than J.W. Lee's Barley wine, the only thing missing is some time in the barrel.

Poured at about 44 degrees into a snifter this beer has an appearance of opaque orangish, rustic brown with minimal head. The aroma is of sweet hints of subtle wet cardboard and wet basement yet has some bourbon, caramel, vanilla, fruity woodness mixed in. The flavors are very much of the aroma with some hints of tobacco. I'm telling you if I didn't see the bottle I would have thought it was a J.W. Lee vintage. For $3 this beer kicks ass! It might just need to age and be stored properly. This is for sure the best Lithuanian beer I have ever had.

Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,"Rinkuškiai ""Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils""
16.9 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, coded ""L.13021""
$2.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: Cool label. I'm not sure what the santa hat is doing on a guy who looks kind of like the devil, but OK. And what is ""naturally fermented beer""? Is there an un-natural way of fermenting beer? I have not heard of that yet but I digress. It pours a clear amber-orange body beneath a short head of bright white that is fizzling away before my eyes. At 15% alcohol though I guess that a little of that is expected. Ahhh, wait, although it's clear, not quite fingerprint-through-the-glass clear, but clear, the bottle says it's ""partially filtered, bottle-conditioned"" and maybe that's what they mean by ""naturally fermented beer"". Unfortunately partially filtered is not the same thing as bottle-conditioned, and I highly doubt you'd get much additional carbonation at 14+% alcohol unless you had a really tolerant yeast strain, but OK, here I go getting off-track again, back to the beer. There's some higher alcohol and ethyl acetate in the aroma. Not good. There's some adjunct laden and bready & caramelish malt as well but the nail polish aroma is distracting - big loss of points on that count. Of course, to be honest, I was kind of expecting that. This isn't from Russia, it's from Lithuania, but that's close enough and I've found a lot of the beers from the Baltic region with higher gravities and alcohol contents suffer from hot and fast fermentations. Personally I believe that they actually like this over there, but different strokes for different folks, right? At least it doesn't taste like anti-freeze was added, that's pretty much soley a Russian thing. Moving forward, and if you think I was kidding I wasn't, the flavor reflects those higher alcohols and ethyl acetate as well. It's not the worst I've ever had but it's still not good. I'm only a couple of sips into this and I'm not sure I want to finish it. I fear I might black out, or maybe do something weird if I get drunk on it. It's malty though, and at least I like that; and it's balanced by a low-level bitterness and the hot alcohol which equals a dry finish. There are, unfortunately, no noticeable hops. Perhaps some leafy, grassy, and spicy undertones are there but that's it. No, this is more like the malt prior to distilling Bourbon. Given that it's flawed it's hard to score it well, but at the same time I have had worse so it is what it is, and it gets what it gets. Medium-full in body with a dextrinous side and a moderate, soft carbonation that leaves it smooth and doesn't amplify the alcohol or heat that's there. Not the best by any means, but certainly not undrinkable.",3.5
Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,"The look is that of a Samuel Adams Boston lager. The smell and taste is basically the same. Decent beer that has been sitting in a rusty bucket, it even slightly stings.

It doesn't taste like one of those iced beers, it's not thick, it won't make you puke if you chug it(which has happened to me with King Cobra and Natty Daddy).

It smells of sweet malt, brown sugar, caramel, and dark fruit. The smell is vaguely reminiscent of a Barleywine. The taste, though, is awful: cloyingly sweet with astringent alcohol; there's nothing subtle about this . . . and nothing good, either. It's bereft of carbonation and the booziness is over the top. This may be the least pleasant beer I've had. Don't let the look and smell fool you; it's simply dreadful stuff!",2.0

apples and slick malts with a warming almost clean finish. Decent mouth feel for such a beast;
slick, smooth, and warm as a camp fire in the belly. Overall, if you want a fast beer buzz this works

The selection was not all that impressive, although I managed to build a mixed sixer and on the way out, I spied this bottle sitting on a clearance table. While most people might run in the other direction from such things, for me, it was a clarion call! This brewski and I are crazy!

I Pop!ped the cap, but I was uncertain as to how to proceed with that ""partially filtered"" business. I went with a gentle pour that produced only wisps. An agitation of the liquid stubbornly brought forth a momentary finger of tawny head that quickly reverted to wisps. I spilled a little on my hand and it proved to be some of the stickiest stuff that I had ever encountered! Color was solidly Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-plus quality clarity. The nose was extremely sweet, like toffee or caramelized sugar. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, but its decided lack of carbonation kept it from achieving fullness. It had a decidedly dollop-like quality on the tongue, though. It just sat defiantly, awaiting my next move. The taste was really sweet & sugary, beyond simple maltiness, this was like dumping a bag of sugar into a pitcher with Kool-Aid mix, adding water and stirring. It was sugary & malty to the point of saturation. Having established that piece of the puzzle, the next thing to hit was its heat. As a previous reviewer remarked, at 15% ABV, this is up there with wine, or put otherwise, this is a 30 proof beer! Phew! They could have distilled this and no one would have been the wiser. I didn't really catch it until the finish, when my gullet suddenly lit up like I had swallowed barium. This leads me to my next aspect - it is a Sneaky Pete! The labeling cops to its intensity, but the taste gives nothing away initially, and then, out of nowhere, it comes with a rabbit punch to the fontanelle at the base of the neck, rendering one nearly unconscious! I consider myself a seasoned beer drinker, but this had an immediate, adverse effect on me. Why would they brew something this strong? It must render the average consumer crazy! The big takeaway on this, for me, was that it was not unpleasant (think Manjit & Ravinder Minhas products), making it just that much more dangerous. I felt no guilt or shame, just a creeping drunkenness that seemed to increase with every sip.",3.0
Crazy Brewski Imperial Pils,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy copper coloring with a thin halo of white head. Aromas of tangy sweet malt notes, and some farmhouse skunky characters. Flavors are caramel rich and tangy forward, like a straight malt extract. This is swill, seriously. Wow. The body is full and slick. There is no mistaking what you are suffering through on this one. Good lord. The higher ABV builds a warmth as you go, and the finish has a solid linger of shame and regret. In all honesty, this is an extremely out of balance, over-boozed take on an imperial lager, and it missed.",2.5

Aroma was slightly mango-esque, so it didn't miss the mark by much there.

Taste, the mango character is also there in the taste. But its all downhill after hitting that extract. Still super fizzy. Lacks a malt, yeast or hop aspect of the beer, but hey, this hits that adjunct spot with some sugar added in to cover up the alcohol. Its nowhere near as offputting as the lime one is.",2.25

Pure Blonde,"When I was a fresh-faced, just out of high school 18 year old, I loved my Pure Blondes. Truth be told I didn't know shit from shoe polish when it came to beer, and I think I enjoyed it for it's light, crisp taste, and it's tremendous marketing at the time. The bogan truck driver going through the pristine forest, where angels were bottling Pure Blonde out of a river, only for the truck driver to grab a Dove out of the area and open up a beer with the dove. It's fallen by the wayside for me ever since I had my first Pale Ale, and since then I've watched it go from 4.9% ABV, to 4.6% ABV and now a rather pityful 4.2% ABV.

CUB have also played around the marketing of this beer, over marketing the fact it's ""low-carb, and vegan, and organic"" etc.

Let's see if I still have fond memories of my 18-year old self. Poured into my pint glass from a 375ml can

Look. Having poured this out of the can aggressively, it's only produced a fingers worth of frothy white head that's dissipating quickly. Standard Aussie Lager look, clear, pale golden, maybe slightly lighter than your more full strength options. Clear, filtered, bog standard.

Smell: Grassy/Citrus hop notes but definitely Pride of Ringwood in there as well. Slightly malty, slightly grainy, slightly bready. Not too bad.

Taste: Smooth, mellowed malt sweetness, followed by a slight bitterness. Slight grain flavour, but a few seconds after the sip I do pick up a chemical aftertaste.

Feel: Highly carbonated, but easy drinking. Goes down smooth. Highly refreshing. Would be worth a can or two to quench the thirst on a hot summer day.

Overall. It gets a pass from me. Maybe it's old nostalgia from my adult teenage years, but I can't hate it completely. It's not nearly as good as I remember it from being 18, and I think the reduction in ABV from 4.9 to 4.2% is playing a part on that, as the flavours are quite mellow.

I don't buy into the whole low carb charade a lot of Aussie beers are going with now. It's probably one of the better 'low-carb' lagers out on the market as it's not overly sweet, and easy drinking. I'm unlikely to buy this at the pub, or a slab of it unless it's on special",2.5
Pure Blonde,"A pale, clear lemon yellow with a small but lasting and lacing creamy white head. Aromas of grain, straw, lemon pith and grass carrying through onto the palate.

Pure Blonde,"Format: a 355mL green bottle with a pretty standard macro label.

Appearance: a pale amber yellow in colour with sparse carbonation. A fluffy white head that drops to a thin film, sporadic lacing. Okay.

Aroma: not very much there at all. It was at this time I noticed it was a low carb. Oh God.

Taste: actually picks up a bit here - some light but quality grains but that's about it. Still, okay for a low carb.

Aftertaste: drops away very quickly, as expected. No hop bitterness, just a slightest touch of grain.

Mouth feel: light in feel with a moderate to higher carbonation. Feels pretty much like a standard macro lager, which isn't bad for a low carb macro lager.

Overall: if my brain fell out and I decided that low carb beers were a good idea (even though carbs are low in beer anyway, and it is kilojoules to watch out for), this wouldn't be a bad one. Fortunately I am still have my full faculties however, so this is going into the ""not bad for a low carb, but still pretty ordinary as an actual beer"" category.

San Mig Light,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass

Appearance – The beer pours a golden straw color with a two finger head of pure white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma of the brew rather nice for a light brew in a clear bottle. While I was expecting tons of skunk, there was none, instead the brews aroma was quite strong of a cereal smell; sorta like cheerios. Along with these smells comes some corn syrup and a bit of caramel as well.

Taste – The taste begins with a bready taste mixed with some caramel. As the taste moves on, some of the caramel fades, being replaced by a blend of light fruits and corn syrup sweetness. All the while some hay and grass develop in the middle of the tongue, with them only fading later more toward the end of the taste. With the flavors that are left at the end of the taste, and with a little bit of a cardboard taste that comes at the very end, one is left with a malty, lightly off (cardboard and corn) taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thin with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. For the somewhat off and lighter abv. of the brew the feel is quite appropriate and makes for a more easy drinking brew overall.

Overall – A decent light brew overall. Its aroma was very surprising to me, but its flavor was a bit lacking. Nothing all that hot here, but hey, if you are drinking a light beer looking for tons of flavor, then you are automatically barking up the wrong tree. Also for only 100 calories for the 11.2 fl.oz bottle, this light beer packs more punch then the average light beer so….",3.25
San Mig Light,"Crystal clear light straw gold with fine and fluffy pure white head of lower retention. Not bad lacing though. Smells like table honey. Similar to a Dos Equis (I should know, had one earlier today). Taste is way different though. Honey component is still there, but for the most part it's — I don't know what else to call it — dry hay, with kind of a medicinal (but non-phenolic) finish as well. While all of this doesn't make me gag, it's far from a compliment. I'm not a horse. I pity the people who feel they have to drink this over not only other San Miguel offerings, but most other light beers. I wouldn't even call it bad, I just have a hard time recognizing it as a beer. At least as far as flavor is concerned. Appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel are all okay or tolerable. Very light body, lots of spritz. This makes it easier to ignore what it tastes like, I think. Surprisingly astringent for what it is, but bubbles up after it's been swallowed. I don't weight my ratings according to a beer's style or price point. I rate them all as 'beer'.

But today, I'm going to take my beer goggles off, drop my snobbery,ayour thirst quickly, easily, with no fuss, and not get you too smashed up in the unforgiving tropical heat that is Queensland.

Look - 2.5/5: The iconic gold can, referred to as a Mango in Queensland (drinking out of the can is known as 'sucking on a mango') is pretty Iconic. And you gotta admit, bright yellow can, Australia, sunshine, happiness.
Poured into a standard Ikea tumbler, rough pour, an extremely filtered, clear golden colour. Slightly darker than the can itself. Frothy bubbly white soapsuds head, it's a classic Aussie adjunct.

Smell - 2.25/5: Corn, Wet grassy hops and bitterness, provided by the Pride of Ringwood obviously, some light biscuit malt. I've smelt this time and time and time again, mix and match any Aussie adjunct lager.

Taste 2/5 - Cereal grain, light bitterness from the hops, light maltiness, watery, almost like I'm drinking a flavoured sparkling mineral water, beer flavoured mineral water with a slight chemical aftertaste.

Feel: 2.25/5 - Highly carbonated, watery, thin, but on a 35 degree, 80% plus humidity day up in Far North Queensland, that's what you need.

Overall: Outside of Queensland, the Northern Territory, or North-Western Western Australia, this is a terrible, terrible beer. I know it's a midstrength lager, but hell, even Great Northern Super Crisp has a better overall flavour than XXXX Gold.
However in those aforementioned months, particularly during the summer months of the year, this is an excellent brew. It's thin, crisp enough, highly quaffable, and being a 3.5% beer, you can drink a few of them and still be in a condition to do stuff afterwards. And that's where and when I'll accept XXXX Gold as an acceptable beverage. Because those are the conditions this beer is brewed for. You wouldn't go drinking a super thick IIPA, or a stout in those conditions, no. And you shouldn't be drinking this in the Snowy Mountains of NSW in the depths of Winter (unless you were driving, you were being sensible, and there's no other light-mid option). To me it's always tasted like a beer flavoured mineral water.",2.25
XXXX Gold,Gold in color with with excellent clarity. There’s a fingernail of eggshell white around the rim and covering all but a sliver of the top. Light lacing. The aroma is of corn and a hint of grassy hops. I’m tasting a bit of diacetyl and some grassy hops at the back of the palate. The mouth is watery and thin.,2.75
XXXX Gold,"Best by August 20th 2019. Can.

Looks gold enough to me. Pretty fluffy head of foam, lacing is good.

Simple nose of corny grain, some but not enough of that Aussie malt, mild touch of hops.

No surprises in the taste. Light flavours, it is 3.5%abv, of corn/grain, tiny malt sweetness, low presence of hoppy bitterness. Served cold cuz I reckoned that would put it at its optimum.

Pretty decent mouthfeel considering.

Nice to try, once.",3.0
XXXX Gold,"The very definition of a mid beer...
An Australian domestic made for the working class, sitting at 3.5% and 375ml, which equals 1 “standard” drink. Allowing people to manage their alcohol intake at places where you need to drive, out in the bush, the beach, the pub home after work, this beer is extremely popular because it targeted a demographic of people on the move.

Goes down best with fish and chips from your local, or after mowing the lawn on a hot and humid Aussie day ice cold. 3.5% means it lacks much punch however, it can feel a bit watery as well as lack carbonation from time to time. Clear, bright and orangy-yellow, one finger of head when poured, however due to my fondness of this domestic drop, I prefer I straight out of the dark bottle, its just an icon of suburban Brisbane. Not a classy beer but a well mapped and demographically targeted beer that’s just very average. It is popular here for a reason!!",2.75

XXXX Gold,"Well, well, well well well - XXXX the beer Queenslanders love to hate - nowhere else in this big brown land are people so vehemently against one of their own iconic products, but nearly every single Queenslander I met when I lived in Brisbane hated this brewery and the beers they produced. I often found myself wondering who was drinking all the XXXX and how they could stay in business, then a mate told me ""It mostly gets sent down to NSW, Victoria and SA"" like some form of cruel punishment to the other states for being terrible at the State of Origin. Then I found out that XXXX got bought out by Kirin, which explained everything. Anyway despite my polemic I had an ice cold XXXX Gold once and didn't mind it so much (as I recall it was a choice between that or a VB).

Poured from a 375ml Stubbie into a nonic pint.

A: Like a plethora of Aussie macro Lagers XXXX Gold presents a clear golden body with a white head that fizzles to nothing.

S: Barnyard apples that have been dropped on the floor mingle with grainy malts and vegetable hop notes. Certainly not as bad as I remember from the Bitters aroma, however it must be noted that this is the watered down version.

T: Grainy malts mostly. There is a hint of apple and the finish is an awkward dry cabbage flavour (Pride of Ringworm strikes again!). About as refreshing as a glass of sheep dip on a hot summers day (and I'm not referring to the whiskey of that name).

M: Understated, watery and light bodied with a crisp medium carbonation.

D: Look this is really a winner when the other options are VB, Toohey's New and XXXX Bitter - aside from that there is little reason to touch this with a barge pole, unless your plan was to knock it off a table to smash it on the ground with said barge pole.

Food match: Whatever they're selling at the footy match you're currently attending as that is the only reason you purchased this beer in the first place.

Side note: The classic New South Welshperson joke goes that ""Queenslanders call it XXXX because they don't know how to spell BEER"" [Yeah there's definitely some inferiority complexes at play between those two states].",2.0

Molson Canadian Ice,"Finale from the mixed pack. Never knew they made an ice version of this. Had the original plenty of times though I haven't seen it in quite some time..but maybe that's because I haven't looked for it considering High Life is always my go to cheapy. The word "" Ice "" I almost always another way to say "" hangover imminent "". Lets do it.

Looks the part. Clear yellow, big white eggshell head with a shit load of carbonation. Nothing left after a finished glass.

Chemical comes to mind on the nose with fair hints of alcohol. Adjuncts are all there as expected. Creamed corn dominant.

Taste luckily loses the chemical factor. Thank Satan, thought this was about to be another Labatt maximum Ice disaster ( The worst disaster since 9/11 ). Adjuncts amp up, hillybilly asshole level corniness.

Feel is rather sticky, sweet and corny with a super level of carbonation. Swallows with a shallow alcoholic bite and leave your mouth dry as a transexuals vagina.

Overall it's pretty average. The scent is a throw off, the feel is a bit odd but otherwise it's just your standard run of the mill brew. Probably not worth the imminent hangover.",2.75
Molson Canadian Ice,"Because it was on a sale rack next to the cash register.

Standard version of an ice beer. Good Lord, there must be a real demand for this stuff because everybody and his brother seem to be making multiple versions. It's lightly colored, lightly hoped and lightly flavored with a higher ABV being it's primary asset. Maybe the target customers really don't mind a lack of malt into their purchase decisions, and that's ok too. Like roaches and spiders cheap beer has it's place in the overall scheme of things.

Just the thing for the Ice Beer ticker who rarely travels North.",2.25

Golden Eagle Beer,Bland ugly looking beer that had done separated sediment. Smell is cloying sweet of corn and honey. Taste is far better than the nose. Tastes of lemon and champagne are bright and zesty leaving a mild vinegar finish. Finishes crisp. Quite fascinating for an adjunct. Really hits the spot with spicy food.,3.0

Golden Eagle Beer,"Golden Eagle Lager Beer has a thick, slightly off-white head, a clear, very bubbly, deep golden appearance, and lots of thick lacing sticking to the sides of the glass. When I swished the bottom and poured, some yeast chunks were seen in the foam, and the foam turned tan (at the top). The aroma is full- pungent, sweet, malty, and noticeable as soon as the cap is popped. The flavor is really strange. There is an overriding charcoal taste in the beer, so it has a pronounced rauchbier character. One will also pick up sweetness, barley malt, and hops, but the smoke is overriding. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Golden Eagle Lager Beer finishes crisp, refreshing, and smoky. Overall, even with the bizarre nature, it is still quite good. Check it out, for an unusual experience.

Golden Eagle Beer,"A: The beer is crystal clear light yellow in color and has a moderate to high amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a half finger high bright white head that quickly died down but consistently left a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface.
S: There are strange and unpleasant strong aromas of burnt rubber and melted plastic in the nose.
T: Similar to the smell, the taste has flavors of burnt rubber and plastic along with notes medicinal flavors and some smoke along with some hints of cooked corn.
M: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.

Golden Eagle Beer,"Found some of this at a liquor a store I frequent. This is my first beer from India. Poured into my pint glass with some vigor and got no head. Pale yellow in color. Nose is extremely faint. Musty and some lemon rind. Taste caught me off guard. I felt like I was sipping something that sat in a ceramic jar in my grandparents basement. A musty/earthy(in a bad way) flavor, similar to saki, that is hard to get through. It then transitions to pennies and a unpleasant dryness. Sadly my $4.24 got poured down the drain.",1.0

Golden Eagle Beer,"Mohan Meakin Limited - Golden Eagle Lager Beer
No freshness date, but there is a Mfg. Date (MAR 19 - must be almost a year old) and a Batch No. (3815)

The cap opened with a soft hiss. I assumed that there was probably not a lot of carbonation, and tasting it revealed that it does, indeed, have a moderate, very fine bubbled carbonation.

I noticed that there's an odd color to it as poured it. It's golden, but there's something else as well. I don't know if I'd call it pinkish, or perhaps greyish, but there is a certain cast to it, and it appears 'dusty'. It's also a bit hazy, but I expected that. It built a very thin head of white, but that dissipated quickly. With a limited carbonation that's to be at least partially expected, but I'm sure there's more going on than that.

In the nose I found some malt and a touch of grassiness, but it didn't appear fresh at all. In fact, blindfolded I might not even have guessed that it was beer at all. It's not off-putting though, it's just more like an Eastern Bloc lager than a European ""Pilsner"".

The flavor is interesting, so at least it's got that going for it. It's malty, with a bit of an adjunct side to it (...some kind of unrefined sugar), and some dull, kind of grassy hops. It's also a touch buttery with a hint of DMS (Dimethyl Sulfide/cooked corn) and even a touch of plastic (or is that burnt-plastic?). Obviously there are some fermentation issues to be dealt with, but again, they're not really off-putting. It's hardly bitter, although there is some (probably around 12 IBU's); and it finishes pretty much the way it began but a touch dryer. Oddly, I kind of like the buttery and almost smokey phenolic... it's weird, it's interesting... but it's not a very good example of the kind of beer I believe they were trying to make here. Or perhaps not. Maybe this is exactly what they wanted. It does seem like it would go well with Indian cuisine. And that makes me question whether this is bad at all, or not? Maybe it's good that we have this weird beer. Maybe it's good that there are odd derivations out there. When everyone starts trying to produce the finest European-style golden lager, everything becomes homogenized, and we end up with ONE beer made by everyone. Hmmm... didn't that happen with American lager?

As for the mouthfeel, I did like that. It's light in body, but also a bit sugary, and it appears almost light-medium. The carbonation is soft, and very fine bubbled (there's not much to be released), and it's fairly smooth across the palate despite the lack of body.

Drinkability? It's a light bodied, fairly sweet beer. That gives it a little something. But it's also not quite what you might expect a beer to taste like; and without hop flavor and bitterness it's not particularly refreshing unless you drink it ice-cold. And that's the way it should be 'enjoyed', because the phenolics become more pronounced once it's warmed.",3.0
Golden Eagle Beer,"A: poured a light golden orange with pale yellow highlights that had a thin ring of head with very little lacing sticking to the glass.

S: plums and vinous notes greeted me first but had a blend of grains but it had a weird earthy aroma that I could not put my finger on it.

T: the flavor was also big on the plum but had grape accents with good sweet malt backing. It had berry fruit notes to it that might be juniper berries.

M: the brew was light body with a fair amount of carbonation which had. Slight sweet but crisp finish.

D: it drank really good and went even better paired with some shrimp tandoori.",4.0
Golden Eagle Beer,"A: Against natural lighting appeared a golden-honey with a brilliant clarity, enough so to easily read the finest of text through. Random instances and burst of carbonation appear while the head was dirty white in color, porous and soapy in appearance, while short in execution.

S: There was a bit of green leafy hopping on the nose, quite pronounced with instances of candy oranges and white sage honey. There is a backup of herbal notes, oranges and a sweet white peppery twang on the finish. Overall sweet but somehow intriguing per style.

T: Sweet honey and corn syrup composes the initial flavor. Oranges, with a warm sweetness of butter scotch and a slight touch of herbal terragon best sums things up. Overall not as interesting nor complex as the nose led you to believe. There is a bit of ripe fruitiness on the finish as well some leafy green hopping. Overall offers a bit more spiciness and flavor complexity then your average American adjunct so ill leave it at that.

M: Light mouthful but feels a bit bigger at times due to the slippery texture and watery honey like feel. Tame carbonation lacks the crispness or should I say ""fizziness"" that most American adjunct lagers are noted for.

D: Once again, considering by style this was somewhat more bearable then your typical beers offered by BMC. A bit overly sweet certainly limits this in multiples, which sadly is the whole concept of a light lager, so it bears a double edged sword. A bomber pushes my patience and tolerance but I finished it.",3.0

Golden Eagle Beer,"Trip to the I.D. always turns up a new beer or two.

REally sugary aroma and not much like malt. In fact, the more I try to pin it down the more I think it smells like brown sugar. No hops to speak of and a little fruit/estery for a lager.

Pale gold with lots of rising carbonation but no head. Has a little hazy apperance too.

Flavor is tough to like. Tastes a lot like honey malt with just the barest amount of bittering hops. It really comes across sweet and lightly malty, again with the sugary emphasis and not malt.

Medium bodied with a light but refreshing carbonation level. The mouthfeel is one of the few positives I can find to say about this beer.

Well it is drikable but more like a soda pop. It's pretty sweet and carbonated and taste not totally unlike beer but the sweetness is really not good.",2.5

Golden Eagle Beer,"650 ml bottle:

Pours bright, clear straw yellow with a thin white head that lasts a few seconds before vanishing.

The smell is some husk, a bit soapy, something oddly smokey-ish.

The taste is sweet - in an artificial sweetener sort of way, soapy, some wet cardboard. As is progresses there is an odd smoky touch that seems out of place. It's not quite as pronounced as in some other offerings from India, but is enough to be out-of-line with the style, and along with other flaws in here, this just ends up being something rather of a mess. Lightly sweet, with almost no bitterness in the weak, fizzy finish.

Light-bodied and rather fizzy, the aftertaste - thankfully mild - is not very pleasant.

Almost half-way through, I considered ""drain pour"", but I managed through it - something of an achievement. This is not one I would recommend trying - weak, soapy, wet-cardboardish, rather fizzy, a bit smoky - rather a mess all-in-all.",2.0

The taste starts with a macro lager like sweetness, but quickly becomes the same as the smell. I've never tasted anything like it. It certainly isn't good, but it also isn't quite as offensive as one might expect.

YUCK!. Easliy the worst tasting beer I have ever had. An almost medicinal taste, very similar to a weak disinfectant, Dettol, or something.

Smell: A nasty aroma of stale hops and overcarbonation. This isn't looking good.

Taste: Barely one note of light hops bleeding into a sharp finish. There's very little to say about this beer's taste. It's a bit like water with a beer flavour; in fact the main note is water. This beer is bland, uninspired, unambitious, and poorly built, even for the price.

Mouthfeel: Wet and fizzy throughout. Unrefreshing. Neither smooth nor coarse, but discernably awful.

Drinkability: At least it's a bit better than most American macro lagers. At this price range, if you're just looking to get intoxicated, you're better off going with Steel Reserve. This beer might taste better on the way up. If I weren't a broke student I wouldn't be having another.",1.5

Look - Transparent yellow without a head and an assload of carbonation. No stick.

Smell - Here's where things really get fun. Absolutely astringent in every sense of the word. All reference to beer was filtered from this thing and replaced with leftover industrial cleanser.

Taste - If you've read the scent, you already understand the taste. Bitter as all get out to boot.

Feel - Heavily carbonated like champagne on steroids and far too thick bodied for its own good. Swallow induces the gag reflex and nearly makes you spit up the beer.

Overall - Absolutely atrocious in every sense of the word. Figured this was going to be another generic light lager without a frill that scored in the mid 2's and forgotten by tomorrow morning. Instead I will remember this for all the wrong reasons. A light lager...hell any adjunct lager style is supposed to be easy going and poundable without a care in the world. This thing fails in every single regard aside from maybe the appearance. Up there with steel reserve and labatt maximum ice in terms of worst tasting beers I've ever had the displeasure of consuming. Any other light lager you can grab at a supermarket is like a TIPA compared to this. Seriously. Even something as putrid as NATURAL ICE tastes like heaven compared to this.

what I can add from memory: don't know what I was thinking, but I gotta lower the marks for smell and taste, as its initial aromas (and they eventually vaped off) were truly off-putting... aside from its introductory stench, Lone Star is a pretty basic adjunct lager, but on the lower end of its echelon... only a when-in-Texas thing I guess (2031)",3.25
Lone Star Beer,"Drank from the can. Date on can: Dec 05 2022.

Other reviewers have already summed up the vibe: clear, yellow, fizzy, perhaps a bit darker than your typical American adjunct. Aroma is sweet grains, corn, bread and yeast with a bitter, grassy hoppiness. Taste follows the nose well. Very reminiscent of Coors for me, with a clean mouthfeel and solid flavor for the style with a bit more balance than most adjuncts, which tend to be too sweet. I quite enjoy the body of this one, it's not as thin and ultra carbonated as a Pabst Blue Ribbon, actually has a tiny bit of chewiness.

Figured I had to try this while I'm living in Texas and it actually slightly exceeded my expectations. Coors was my previously highest rated American adjunct macro, and I think this one might slightly edge it out due to a better aroma, but it's very close. This isn't something I would pick up routinely unless I was in a monetary bind, as it is priced quite modestly, but it certainly gets the job done, most especially on a hot summer day.

Lone Star Beer,The national beer of Texas. My go-to.,5.0
Lone Star Beer,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium golden color iwht a bright white and soft head. SRM of 6. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of pale malts, bread malts, bread yeast, and some corn adjuncts in the middle. Yeast on the finish. (3.75)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of pale malts, corn adjuncts in the middle. Some bread and yeast. More adjuncts, corn, carbonation to finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Stronger carbonation. A yeasty and full mouthfeel to finish.

Compared to Miller High Life 6/16/22: Pours a darker color, stronger aromas. More yeast, bready, corn adjuncts. Less smooth simple pale malt. Less carbonation and sweeter.

Compared to Venice House Lager 6/16/22: Pours a darker or paler, clearer appearance. More pale malt aromas, less sweet biscuit. More clean, pale malt. Lighter and cleaner. Simpler.

Overall: This one exceeded my low expectations. Nice pale, bready malts and yeast here. Bready, yeasty, full-bodied and maintains a nice bread flavor. I'm not sure why I expected less, but this one dranks pretty well. I'll seek it out again sometime for another review (Rating: 3.97)",4.0

This is almost like a wheat beer, but lighter. It even has hints of banana esters, but at least omits the phenols of a hefeweizen. Still, it's sort of confusing.

Having this straight out the bottle while sitting on the front porch of the gun store at Ten Bits Ranch, the chances of line contamination are nil, but I have no frame of reference for this brew otherwise.

Ahhh yes, this is quite comical. Never even knew there was a light version of good ole PBR. Drank about ten thousand regular ones on my college days. Friend came over with a mixed thirty of "" who knows what "" out of his now deceased grandfathers basement. Not even sure if this stuff is brewed anymore. Oh well, for the sake of experimentation!.

Look - Surprisingly deep yellow with a big frothy white head that pops and splats like soap bubbles. Carbonation is fairly high as expected. Head actually retained quite well and left a bit of lacing to my shock. 3.5.

Smell - Grains are on high much like its older brother. Adjuncts are clearly apparent though do not lead the way which is always a plus. A bit of an alcoholic smell despite the low ABV. 3.

Taste - Bit fresh bready grain ordeal going on right from the get go. Adjuncts fall to the back end and you're met with that slight grape flavor Pabst is typically famous for. Must admit, it tastes exactly like its big brother. Even if this beer is old it has held up quite well. 3.5.

Feel - The body is as watery and smooth as ever with a massive dosage of carbonation. Feels thin, even for a light lager. 2.75.

Overall - I'm honesty more impressed than my score may lead you to believe. I will admit I have and always will have a soft spot for PBR and they managed to pack the majority of big brothers flavor and all aspects into a little brother version. Cannot complain a bit . 3.5",3.5

Schaefer Light,"It's silly to attempt a philosophical description or review about this beer or any other in it's class. If you are buying it, there is a reason and that reason is you are looking for a good value beer. Schaefer Light is an excellent value beer.

Do you really care what it looks like when it's poured? Why would you even be pouring this beer?? Drink it straight from the can on a hot summer day.

Like most every other macro or American adjunct, the aroma is grain, sweet, some corn.

The taste is where Schaefer Light shines above it's brethren. It leaves absolutely no aftertaste at all, finishing clean and crisp. Extremely clean, absolutely refreshing. Medium carbonation, great mouthfeel, and completely enjoyable.

I know it's cliche or chic to say how much of this you consumed in college when your tastes were unrefined or that it's the worst beer in existence, but Schaefer Light is actually a great tasting, refreshing, value beer perfect for a 90 degree day, or when you want to put many back and don't feel like crushing a huge IPA with an ABV over 8. Very enjoyable.",3.25
Schaefer Light,"Across the board gross. Worst beer in existence. Pours with barely any color and a bit of foamy head on top. Aroma is weak watery corn adjunct, hay, water, blegh.

Schaefer Light,"*consumed from a room temperature glass mug

A - The color is a clear lemon jolly rancher. Or maybe one of those pale yellow diamonds. But don't be misled. This beer is no diamond. Pours a standard hotel towel color white fluffy head. Very bright very bleached.

S - Well bad news first. Summer officially started here this week. The kids are out playing. The weather is nice. Imagine that old slip-n-slide getting pulled out of the attic and dusted off. That slightly worn creaky rubber plastic smell. Now imagine a mother skunk sliding down that damp Tarmac. That's tge image this beer gives me. Normally these adjunt lagers have vague smells of corn sugar and processed rice. This bad boy doesn't even have that. It's the beer that just never was.

T - As you can now imagine. There's not a lot going on here. You know that sceene in Back to the Future when Marty starts to fade away. That's this beer. The time stream has been changed and you never actually drank this beer.

M - Tough to comment on. Left over slipnslide water from the above image perhaps.

D - It's affordable. That's worth something.",1.5
Schaefer Light,"Purchased in Alexandria, MO, which is right on the Iowa border. Geographically and culturally, it's one of the most depressing areas I've ever been to. The brokenness is hard to describe, since it doesn't fit into any of your typical templates of poverty or decay. It's a forgotten, dying area. The population dwindles every generation. No one remembers when the place had any sense of having a future. It--it's been decades since failure became a reality, in those parts, and the people there have become strangely comfortable with it.

And, well, don't that vibe come close to mimicking the aesthetic of retro beer? Of course the reality of the matter is, as always, scarier than the Disneyfied fashionistic version of the things (side note: isn't it sad how Disney, MTV, and the New York fashion scene all share the same basic aesthetic now? At least shittiness used to come in different flavors.)

(Side side note: isn't it sad how all these retro beers are brewed by Pabst, meaning by Miller? At least blandness used to come in different flavors).

(Final side note, passing as my review: this is absolutely indistinguishable from PBR light. Trust me, I know.)

It's all an illusion, man. Even the poverty. Even the scariest, most depressing things have become co-opted, absorbed into the horde. This is what it is, and what it is is passable, because that's the scariest part of everything, man, the fact that nothing ever seems that bad.",3.0
Schaefer Light,"Schaefer Light has a thick, white head and a clear, straw appearance, with a pretty good amount of bubbles streaming up. Some sheet lacing is left behind.

Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Schaefer Light finishes crisp, refreshing, and easy drinking. Overall, I was happy to see that this brand had no foul or ugly mineral water aspects.

Quite the looker for a Light Lager; medium yellow, sterily clear, with good head retention in super bright white.

Light corny aroma, a little grain, and something vegetal.

Unsurprisingly, there isn't much flavor. Pretty much the same as the aromas but sweeter than they suggest. A little dryness.

Just what you'd expect, fizzy yellow beer.

The pour created a massive two fingers' worth of bone-white head that actually crowned above the rim of the glass before slowly reducing to to a dense cottony mass. The beer's color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a light cereal/grainy quality underlain by a mild lager sweetness. Nothing new here, folks.

Boris Bold,"500ml can, purchased across the border in Dunham.

Beers like this bring back memories of all of the strong lagers I enjoyed back in the late 1980's and early 1990's in Europe. Some were harsh and some were sweet, all have a fun memory tied to them. Bright and perfectly clear golden hued brew. Mild sweetness with a bready maltiness in the nose and on the palate. Faint cooked veggies and some faint caramel hit the tastebuds. Ample hoppiness for the size and the dryness of the beer, alcohol is very noticeable ... warming but not out of place. With each sip this brew grows on me, enjoyable.",3.75
Boris Bold,"I guess this is the first positive review of this brewery, but I actually really like it. The high abv is masked by the sweetness and it is an extremely smooth beer. The color is an attractive, clear, dark gold. To compare this to Budweiser is harsh. I find it quite delicious and I can't wait to try the even higher abv version.",4.25
Boris Bold,Tastes like flat stadium beer with higher alcohol.,2.0
Boris Bold,"Boris Bold is not a looker - I thought the French had a flare for fashion? There's nothing aesthetic about this (supposedly) golden lager, it is regrettable in every single aspect: the tarnished tone and dulled highlights, the polluted complexion, the total lack of head or lace.

Boris, however, is Bold alright - it smells boldly of sugar, corn syrup, and alcohol. I had someone else try it first just to make sure it wasn't poison. It's almost as if the brewery was attempting to make caramel by dissolving sugar in hot water and then, for whatever reason, they opted instead to ferment the mixture. This is sweet enough to pass for a children's cereal.

Though largely insipid, the flavour still manages to be unpleasant. It tastes like a watery concoction of white sugar, ethanol, and creamed corn kernels (with either the yeast or alcohol adding vaguely fruity esters that lend it a kind of cleaning product characteristic). Hints of brown sugar or caramel are constantly sprouting, but they are without accompanying texture (very watered down) and quickly extinguished by the burn of alcohol.

The skepticism with which I re-approached this beer has proven to be well-founded. I first tried Boris Bold at a time in my life when I found Corona and Heineken perfectly enjoyable lagers - and even back then I found this revolting. It's been years since I could consider those mass-produced lagers even remotely acceptable, so imagine what I make of this now.

Boris Bold is the polar opposite of Boris Organic, which is clean, agreeable, and flavourful - it is it's evil brother. Alcoholics looking for a quick fix could do worse - and, to be sure, that seems to be the brewery's targeted demographic - but no average drinker should subject themselves. The vintners of Alsace, like the German brewers across the Vosges Mountains, have nothing to fear of Brasserie de Saverne; this is no threat to their reputations.",2.5

Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, grains and corn. It basically tastes just alike a regular euro-lager but with some added not so well hidden alcohol. Almost like someone added rum/vodka to a beer. It finishes with a boozy grainy aftertaste with a touch of corn syrup sweetness.

This beer pours a clear pale golden colour, with two fingers of thin creamy, foamy white head, which leaves some random chunks of lace around the glass as it settles. It smells of sweet corn/rice grain, and mild warming alcohol. The taste is more sweet corn, and strong fusel alcohols, very reminiscent of all those times I didn't huff the mouthwash. The carbonation is fairly moderate, the body medium in weight, somewhat smooth, and cloying. It finishes with a leveling off of the sweetness, right into an abyss of alcohol.

I see now why this was placed where it was - while still beer, it's one big sweet boozy mess.",2.0
Boris Bold,"A- Copper with little head which immediately receeded.

S- As soon as I opened the can I could smell alcohol and a sweet aroma. Can't really smell much else.

T- Despite the initial pungent alcohol smell the alcohol taste was fairly background. It starts with more of a sweet toffee syrup taste. It's almost sticky. It tasted a bit too sweet for me and there wasn't even the bitter aftertaste that most beers have. It's almost like an alcoholic pop with little carbonation.

M- Felt strange as if it slid off your tongue but held on to everything else.

D- Not a bad drink if you want to get drunk quick. I would never recommend this for anybody aiming to try a tasty beer though. Tasty for a cheap high ABV though. It didn't offend me as much as some people, but at the same time it didn't impress me like others.",2.0

This isn't a terrible looking beer. There is a massive amount of clumpy off white head, and a crystal clear golden body. The carbonation looks almost soda pop. I can't dog this brew's appearance at all.

There is an aroma of husky graininess, with a hint of burnt toast. There is a slight perfumy smell that I find common in euro lagers, especially strong ones.

The taste isn't too off. Very traditional sweetness up front, but an off skunkiness in the middle, with a medicine like taste in the end.

At first this feels refreshing, but then it's ABV is so apparent, it feels like a job to drink this one down to solely get a beer buzz.

Medium/light bodied with a syrupy texture and moderate carbonation. Alcohol was very hot. Not very good and not overly drinkable - I didn't finish my can. It's just an alcohol bomb with little malt or hop depth. I'd be surprised if it isn't made exclusively from extract. Certainly not a good example of a strong euro-lager.",2.0

Smell- Very weak and a little beany with some yeast.

Taste- Malt liquor like. There is some corn or rice there or both not quite sure which. There is not much of a taste but more of an aftertaste that is kind of gooseberry like.

Boris Bold,"On the initial pour I was quite hopeful. The beer had a nice golden look to it. The smell however was a strong sweet smell, that made me all too aware of the strength of the beer.

My first sip was that it had a very malty sweet taste that initially I liked. Upon another sip the sweet and malty taste became overpowering, bringing with it a mouthfeel that reminded me of hard liquor. In fact there was a brief moment in which I was reminded of congac. I could almost feel a headache coming and was becoming lightheaded near the end of the glass.

Taste: Like fermented yeast infection, with overtones of sour old refrigerator leavings.
Mouthfeel: Good fizz that stayed to the bottom of the glass.

Boris Bold,"Oh Boris beer, you and your silly idealist diatribe written on your label. I can't join in and pick up that flag, because it is coated in painfully transparent and slimy marketing department propoganda with no soul or personality.

Ideologies aside, this Boris Strong came in a 500 ml red can, diatribe and all. Pours out a decent looking lager, deep golden, massive carbonation, and a two finger tight creamy white head with nice retention. Even a bit of lacing.

Bready malt and sour grains on the nose, and the start of the slightest hints of cooked veggies lurking in the background. A thankful touch of hops can be discerned through that ether of cooked veg after a while.

Without further ado, the flavour of this stuff is truly awful, repulsive. Sour mash grains, veg and chemicals assualt your mouth and goes down your throat kicking and screaming, swearing to high hell, and vandalising whatever it comes into contact with. So this is Euro malt liquor, huh....

The mouthfeel is thick, heavy and oppressive, it holds its elbows up high.

I've managed to choke down about a third of a glass of this stuff, and I've had enough of it for the rest of my life--sink pour time. It made quite an impression, and I shall avoid this Boris Bold so it cannot become a repeat offender, I've been violated enough.",1.0
Boris Bold,"Sheesh, what a heavy beer. Feels thick and syrupy in your mouth. Harshly bitter at first sip, slides into a gooey sweetness before finishing off with a blast of alcohol and another bitter parting shot. Leaves a bit of a lingering alcohol burn.

Pours up a nice gold colour with a short head that settles to soap film. Sweet malt noticeable in the nose, along with a whiff of hops and underlying alcohol.

This is an unpleasant beer.",1.5
Labatt Max Ice,Got this in a 24oz can and it was in a cooler at the bottom of all the ice. Drank it directly from the can but poured some into a glass first. Not so bad iced cold. Definitely quenches the thirst or to have with burgers or hot dogs.,3.0

Now don't get me wrong, I love beer and I love drinking top quality brews, but theres nothing wrong with slamming cheap strong beer and catching a buzz with your buds.

Labatt Max Ice,"This one poured very bubbly and fizzy at first, and then settled immediately into pond water. The color is a weak and tepid clear straw yellow. There's a lot of lacing.

This smells horrid - wet stale leaves, old bread, metal, solvent, and green apple.

This is absolutely disgusting, and not even worth the $1.99 it cost. It's just super stale, vegetal, and weirdly sweet and bitter all at the same and in all the wrong places. It definitely tastes like it brewed inside of an old work boot and left to ferment in the Death Valley sun.

This is not drinkable, not even in the least, with a weird stale fruity bite on the back end.

This is disgusting and should be drank by absolutely nobody.",1.75
Labatt Max Ice,"Well I'll first say that I had this at a quite warm temperature, so I admit that it's certainly warmer than ideal, however I drink a lot of beer at rather warm temperatures though, and they still can get good ratings.

Anyway, the smell was like a cheap beer: weak ""standard beer"" smell mixed with a bit of damp socks and/or urine. I suppse some corn too, which is maybe a bit different depending on what you think a typical cheap beer smells like.

The pour was very bubbly with a huge head that dissipated extremely quickly and eventually left no head nor lacing at all after some sips, not even around the edges of the glass. (temperature could play a factor in this, but still I don't think I've ever seen a beer that this has happened with)

The color was typical yellow like pee, with big bubbles everywhere like fresh carbonated soda.

The mouthfeel was rather hollow. It had very prickly carbonation like a fresh carbonated soda, but it didn't maintain its power/foam with some swishes.

Taste was metallic (VERY STRONG METALLIC TASTE), ""watery"" (I guess a lack of flavor) and otherwise just plain lacking, or dare I say ""bad"". While there was certainly SOME hops in here, it wasn't especially noticeable, nor was it a kind that tasted particularly good nor interesting in any way to me (just kind of generic bitterness/hopiness?). There wasn't much of maltiness taste to me either, or at least there was a lack of complexity/body to any maltiness that was there. I did quite easily notice multiple times a bit of ""corn"". If you've ever been to a brewery/distillery that uses corn fermentation you should know what I mean, but I suppose even eating fresh corn might give a bit of a similar taste. While senses can sometimes be deceiving/wrong, I believe that this beer must have been fortified with a corn-based low-filtration alcohol, otherwise I don't know why I'd be tasting any corn in this. Am I crazy to say this? I don't know if that's something that's ever done. Heck maybe it's a beer made mostly/exclusively from corn? is that possible? because that's kind of what it tastes like.

I poured it from a 473 ml can (and also drank most straight from the can), which some might say contributed to the metallic taste, but I don't believe in that sort of thing. I don't find that cans affect the flavor in any sort of significant way; especially not to this extent. The last beer I had as a draft from a bar and it tasted very metallic and ""bad"" like this as well, which is an interesting coincidence (it might have been Labatt beer even for all I know, as it was just the house draft). I think the metallic taste is due to the carbonation (carbonic acid), and not being masked enough by any other flavors. Another way to describe it would perhaps be like a mild sodium bicarbonate solution, or club soda. Mix a bit of really cheap low-filtered/unfiltered corn vodka with some club soda and you'd probably be getting close to the taste of what I'm predominately feeling here. Obviously that's a bit of an exaggeration though.


Unsurprisingly the 7% ABV isn't well hidden as it's an extremely prominent ""flavor"" as well. I do like that it has high ABV though, as I've found that I generally do like beers that have higher ABV, which is why I thought I'd give this a shot. However while it is a low price point for relatively high alcohol content, my go-to cheap high-ABV beer is MILES away better than this. Faxe Strong. At least where I live (Canada) Faxe is essentially the same price per ml as this, right around the bottom of what I think the minimum legal price is considering the ABV— or at least around the minimum of what's commercially viable in the country as well considering that they're individually canned and individually sold (although I suppose some are sold in packs as well). I wasn't expecting anything from Faxe Strong, but I was actually surprised at it being very good. It's one of my favorite reasonably-price high ABV-beers, right under most of the stuff that Unibroue produces (although Unibroue comes at a higher price point, still well-priced)

Because of how much I disliked it, or rather how I disliked pretty much every aspect of it, I'm not sure how to even rate this. All I can say is that it's probably worse than anything commercial that I've had before, and is right around the bottom, just probably not worst possible. I'm sure it's possible to scrape lower without getting into non-commercial or spoiled/skunked beers.

I don't know if this is a pro or a con, but I got to ""enjoy"" the beer over a long period of time due to it not being in any way delicious.

So really anywhere between a 1 and a 1.75 (out of 5) seems reasonable to me. The main thing that you take from this is that in most citiess there should be no reason to buy this when there are better alternatives (at least at other stores)",1.5
Labatt Max Ice,"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 4/20/2018. Pours crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/metallic aromas, but not overwhelming; mostly went away as it warmed. Nice an pleasant aromas with bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light honey/nuttiness, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Increasingly warming 8% alcohol, but not too rough of a finish. Overall this is a pretty good iced malt liquor. All around good robustness of bready malt, corn, and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV; with the mildly bitter/boozy finish. Clean and rich barely/grain flavors with mild earthy hop balance. Not overdone on the corn adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable, and well made style example.",3.5

Labatt Max Ice,"I'm sure beer gets worse than this, but I'm blessed that I have only had one that would fall to those murky depths. This is in the bottom 2 worst beers I've ever had, and it's cutting it close. This stuff is awful, don't buy this.

L - Looks kinda off-putting. A yellow, over carbonated pour with some soapy head. Resembles something between fresh urine and mop bucket water. But it's hard to actually fuck this up and it has a head so although it's not a pretty sight, it's not as much of a warning sign as it should be.

S - It's the usual for a beer to rank poorly here because it has no discernible scent characteristics. It's not as usual for it to rank poorly because it actually smells unpleasant. This beer has its standard malty and corny smell, but intertwined with a chemical aroma that just doesn't belong there. It keeps reminding me of cleaner for some reason.

T - I could give the actual account of taste, which is chemical doused corn and alcohol and not much else. But really the way I'd honestly describe it is like drinking regularly bad mass-produced beer, by pouring it on a shirt you've worn for a long time and wringing it out. It's oddly accurate to what you'd imagine, and just as off putting as it should be. Aftertaste lingers for too long, and is a haunting reminder of what just happened.

F - Admittedly the mouthfeel is not horrific. It's actually kinda average. Not that light, little too carbonated, smooth enough, and goes down even if the entire trip is unpleasant. But it's not worth it.

O - If you're not a broke alcoholic, you can be doing better. Hell, even if you are a broke alcoholic you probably can still do better. I refuse to believe that there isn't better options than this. Such as drinking antifreeze or huffing your own excrement.",1.5

S: pretty standard... cookie-candy like, syrupy malt... maybe the faintest whiff of sweet orange peel... no hops and only a whisper of spicy booze...

T: dare I say vaguely Belgian yeast and booze notes (industrial strong Belgian blond) up front - it does finish with a mild caramel sweetness and lingering metallic, old lemon peel, and grassy-bitter notes... the malt seems a bit too clean or perhaps muted - maybe that works in its favor?... the finish is a touch watery... dry-grassy, almost burlap flavor builds along the way

F: lighter body with a delicate viscosity... fluffy soft flow... the finish and residual feel is slightly watery, seemingly allowing the metallic taste to stand out more... quite clean and very easy drinking - the booze is there, like soft white noise near the bottom

Labatt Max Ice,"I thought I would completely eliminate and re-do this review just so I can tell you guys all about the joys associated with this one. No really, It is so bad that it's almost good.

Look - Ever heard somebody say a beer looks like piss? Well I usually don't see that with adjuncts or malt liquors but for the first time in my beer drinking career I safely say...It looks like piss. Dehydrated see through yellow with a monster 5 five white head of soapy bubbles that pop and have chemicals written all over them. Lacing is not a factor as I will not be drinking enough of it to know.

Smell - Remember when I said chemicals? Well yeah. It smells like something you would use to clean the floor of an industrial site. The corn adjunct it there but it smells like it got a fresh spray from monsanto prior to the canning.

Taste - Industrial hopes and dreams. and chemicals. Corny as all hell and not a manageable corn either. More like a rotten, insect infested stalk dowsed in cleaner.

Feel - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. But at least it has something.

Overall - Even if I were to become a hapless, hopeless, homeless alcoholic you could not pay me to drink this stuff. I wouldn't gift this to my worst enemy as I would probably be charged with attempted murder.

Labatt Max Ice,Cheap but OK. Better than most malt liquors,3.0
Labatt Max Ice,"473 mL can from the LCBO; served slightly chilled.

Pours a pale golden-yellow colour, topped with one finger of soapy, frothy white head that gradually recedes over the next few minutes. Nice lacing. Looks fine, but my first sniff is enough to warn me what I'm in for - it's super corny, with grainy malt sweetness, cardboard, melted plastic and some ethanol being the only elements of note. Why do I get myself into these situations?

Pretty gross, even for the style. Very sweet, with lots of corn grist, syrup and apple juice. While this brew generally lacks the papery cardboard notes of many cheap, high-diesel lagers, the alcohol is rather poorly hidden - I am only 3-4 sips in and I am already sick of the stuff. The mouthfeel isn't too bad - medium in body, with a smooth, almost creamy nature due to the restrained carbonation levels. There are only two rules with beers like this - drink them fast, and drink them cold. I sort of broke the last rule, but I think I'm man enough to finish the rest of this can, despite the beer's overall unpleasantness.

Final Grade: 2.11, a disappointing D-. I only know one person who drinks this stuff, and it's definitely not because of the nuanced flavour. Labatt Maximum Ice is good for precisely one thing - getting shitfaced on beer while spending as little money as possible.

Not so as I could tell, at least not on the nose. Mouthfeel was light, airy, watery, about what I have come to expect from Asian Lagers. Par for the course.

Light Beer,"First off I don't like any light beers. I'm a Guinness Stout guy. However, I'll concede there's times when a heavier brew isn't the thirst quencher of choice.

It reminds me of Keystone for those times....at an even better price. It's really light tasting. Not too much adjunct taste or hops bitterness. It really quinces a thirst. It's easy to drink period. For a basement priced brew for those who want to quaff it down this stuff rules. I think it gets no love first because of the segment and second because of the price. Really? What are we reviewing here. For the segment it competes in, and at the price it goes for, this is a singularly good product.

Light Beer,"I’ve rated every quality of this low, and yet the overall score is a 3.5. Why? Because for a measly $22, you can get 48 of these bad boys. 48. At least where I live, you’ll pay 21 for 24 coors, an equally shitty beer in my opinion. For its purpose, you won’t find a better deal, and that’s its appeal. Yellow color, hardly any taste, no head, yet $44 will get an entire college party popping. You know what you’re getting, and to the end this is great.",3.5

Light Beer,"A: Pours a crystal clear pale yellow in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and faint pale golden yellow colored highlights. The beer has a finger tall fizzy bright white head that quickly reduces to a small patch of very thin film and a very thin ring at the edges of the glass. Minimal amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of grainy malts with moderate amounts of corn adjunct sweetness and just a hint of grassy hops.

T: Upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of grainy malts with moderate amounts of rice + corn adjuncts along with a light amount of corn sweetness. That is followed by very light flavors of grassy hops which contribute a light to moderate amount of lingering bitterness.

M: Light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp.

O: While not a style that I generally seek out, this beer was not offensive like some of the other budget offerings in the style. Easy to drink with a crisp, light mouthfeel and well hidden alcohol. I would not go out of my way to seek this out again but I was pleasant surprised.

Note: This was received in thanks from a total stranger in the Costco parking lot for helping him to load a couple of Adirondack chairs into his vehicle.",3.0
Light Beer,"Oof, you have no idea how badly I wanted this beer to be good. At about 40 cents per can I had the highest hopes for this beer to be a crisp and refreshing one. Instead, I am greeted on the nose with an oddly sweet and undeniably moscato-like smell. The taste retains this sweetness, but brings in quite a bit of funk as well. This beer is just too flavorful to be a beer for getting drunk with nothing to enjoy about it in the first place. Very bad beer",1.5
Light Beer,"When I drink light beer, I usually drink Miller Lite. It's not like it has a great flavor-- it's just what I drink when it goes on sale at Rite Aid for under a buck a can. When I saw this at Costco for .50 a can, I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, it's not really as good as Miller Lite. You know how in restaurants, when you order a soda water, they bring it to you with a slice of lime? This beer tastes exactly like that. A lime citrus taste. It's not unpleasant and is probably really nice on a hot day after hours of back-breaking work. It has the same alcohol content as Miller Lite at half the price, but double the carbs and half the taste.",3.0

Light Beer,"The alcohol content is lower than any beer I have ever purchased personally but, the most important thing to comment on is the subpar, disgustingly flat taste in this fermented water. The taste or headache isn't quite as bad as Bud Light but it gets close. I just find it disappointing that such a large company would choose such a low grade beer to put their label on. If it was closer in taste to, say, Pabst Blue Ribbon, or even as low as Coors Light, I'd give 5 stars across board but it's not even close. On the plus side, the price for the quantity is unbeatable and I will most likely continue to purchase this beer and it's hangovers because of this, as well as how good the company treats its customers.",1.0

Taste: Grainy, hint of mineral, light bitterness.

Overall / Drinkability: Not good. I could have finished it but really didn't want to so I didn't since life is too short for bad beer. This one was not off in any way, just not well crafted.

Pours clear bright straw yellow. A thin white head descends to a ring leaving little lacing.

The smell is faint grain with a touch of husk. Clean.

The taste is of a typical cheap light adjunct lager, though there is a touch of soap mixed in. A bit of an odd aftertaste, which fortunately doesn't last.

It is fizzy and light, but no more than typical for the style.

Taiwan Beer,"Poured from an undated 12oz can into a pils glass

On the pour a 2 finger head that pokes out of the top of the glass forms then slowly recedes to a rocky slightly fizzy head then to just a covering over thentop after 10 or so minutes. Body is a light golden straw with a very light chill haze.

Aroma is incredibly light and very clean. Based off the aroma alone and the inclusion of rice as the only adjunct I disagree with the current AAL classification and believe this is much closer to a Japanese Rice Lager. Light hops are present and a very light but clean lager yeast note. Malts are quite light and what is there is rice crackery.

Taste is very similar to the smell again very light, but insanely clean and detectably hoppy. Everything about this is light but the hops are floral and fruity woth almost zero bitterness and the yeast notes are light dry and again vaguely fruity. The finish is where the malt comes in and it is very light and crackery with rice lightness present, but the rice itself doesn't contribute much to the flavor. Once the beer warms a bit there is a bit of a dirty lager finish but it takes a while for it to set in and doesn't cover the good parts of this beer.

Feel is light and very dry with a decent carbonation bite. Very refreshing and drinkable but the mouthfeel is incredibly dry. Not the softest beer in the mouth, a bit of a fizzy feeling. Finish Is medium long but clean.

Overall this is an impressive Asian beer. More than just another boring pale lager, it has some defining features, and a nice floral hoppy note. Very dry and surprisingly good. I only got it because I kept seeing it at total beverage and the can looked nice but this is actually impressive and memorable.",3.75
Taiwan Beer,"never seen this before in the states until today, dubbed ""classic"" now, its a fine asian brew, fuller bodied and slightly sweeter than most, but also mysteriously and thankfully missing the yucky parts of most of these, no metal, no corn, no adjunct cheapness, and while its not all that good, its also not all that bad, and thats at least as valid in this style range, especially from this part of the world, where our american standards really do not apply in the same way, and i am thankful to be trying this, especially with a heady vegan curry burrito, you never know what you are going to find out there. simple stuff here, international lager type, but slightly big, malt liquor-esque to me, a little adjuncty, but not as offensive as so many, and in this category i think its decent. it cuts spice, its not objectively cheap, and there is great carbonation here. that said, i wouldnt choose this even over a basic available lager type here, molson canadian, labatt blue, heck even high life wins here, but its shooting its shot and i dont hate it, smells and tastes like the can, but whatever, its fun, especially in this food context. always been an international yellow beer nerd, and here is another one, life is good!",2.5

Very thin feel to the 4.5%. Finishes cold and fizzy albeit on the watery side. Grainy notes persist. Better in the can for certain as the less desirable mustiness is less noticeable.",3.0
Taiwan Beer,"Look - golden color, transparent, small head that dissipates, leaving virtually no lacing.
Smell - syrupy sweetness, with some malts and rice fragrance. no skunkiness, and actually quite pleasant overall.
Taste - unfortunately, the taste did not make up for the smell. fairly watery, no hops presence, and light malty flavor. finishes with slight sweetness, a strong indicator of the proportion of rice used in this brew.
Feel - light bodied, high carbonation, on par with most adjuncts at 4.5% ABV.
Overall - an adjunct that is quite pleasant on the smell but standard on the taste. nothing atrocious, but nothing amazing either.",3.0
Taiwan Beer,"Purchased in a NC grocery and poured from a 12oz can.
A- Nice, light-golden pour with a 1 finger head that vanishes. Continually working carbonation.
S- An appealing nose: clean, sweet malts, straw and a little citrus.
T- Nothing special, but certainly not a bad beer. Sweet malts (ponlai rice, I assume, responsible for the sweetness), but pretty clean (not corn syrup and not vegetal like nasty Stateside macros). Some straw and something passing for a very light lemon/citrus finish on the tongue. Straight at you BEER. Crisp and refreshing.
M- Well-carbonated, just short of zippy. Not pasty. Not syrupy. Again the word 'clean'.
O- Again, offering nothing special. But definitely a decent lager for this palate.

Carling Lager,"Completely solid Canadian style adjunct. I've written about this in the past, and I think that Canadian adjuncts should be considered the own sub-category, although I'm far too illiterate to explain what exactly that would entail. I do know, however, that the majority of Canadian adjuncts I've had that aren't sold stateside (Molson Export, Labatt 50, etc) have a richer flavor and creamier body than most American adjuncts, with even loss hop presence than their American counterparts and a warmer embrace of cereal nodes.

This is a good example of the style, though not as good as Labatt 50 or Molson Ex. Firm cereal start, crisp and lightly sour middle, light finish with a creamy body throughout.

I don't know where this falls into the (sub/super)-Premium tier of the Ontario beer market, or if such a tiering system even exists outside of the US, but I'd say this would compete well against the Pabst/Bud/Coors segment of the American market. If you absolutely despise macros, then of course you wouldn't like this (and I don't see why you'd bother to rate it).",3.0

Red Stripe Light,Drank for 7 straight days in Jamaica. Perfect abv and feel for the setting. The resort also had Miller lite (which I do not drink often). I did a side by side between the two while floating on a raft in the Caribbean. The red stripe light was superior to the Miller light in terms of smell taste and feel. More hop presence and a nice bready backbone. I’ll probably never drink it outside of my occasional trips to the island. By for 7 days it did me well.,3.0

Pours a dehydrated piss yellow with a large bone white head as expected. Carbonation is heavy, lacing is pretty decent at the end of the swill.

Smells like your typical light lager though red stripe has also been far more corn forward in my opinion

Taste follows suit. Super corny with a mildy bitter lime presence for whatever reason.

Feel is light and watery as you'd expect but it swallows easy and luckily it has no skunk.

Overall I assume this was $1 because it was old and didn't sell or perhaps others from the pack had broken. Dunno but for $1 there isn't much to complain about. There are better adjunct lagers out there.",2.5

The quintessential clear straw-gold with foamy bright white head, lower retention. Weakest beer aroma I have yet to encounter, to my recollection.

Palate, though considerably more tart, isn’t much different, fairly weak though I’ve had weaker, but not altogether unpleasant in spite of its lack of character. Bready aftertaste might be the best thing about this beer. Light-bodied but approaching medium, extra sudsy, each sip seems about 75% CO2.",2.75

Rolling Rock Extra Pale,I grew up in PA. Where this was brewed just outside of Pittsburgh. It seemingly always had a loyal following. A very easy drinking beer. Pours a lite straw color. The aroma is light in hops. Initial taste is light bodied with a subtle taste of sweetness.

Over all a nice easy drinking beer for when you're having more than one.,4.75

Rolling Rock Extra Pale,"Poured into a pint glass out of the 25oz ""one extra oz"" can

On the pour a 2 finger head forms then gets rocky and disappears within a couple minutes leaving only a ring around the glass. Lively carbonation and a yellow golden straw color. Cheap Light ""full flavor"" lager.

Aroma is better than a lot of domestics in the glass to be honest. No skunk or lager grossness. Some diacetyl however, and a corny malty note. Decent for the style but not blowing any socks off.

Flavor follows the aroma with a lightness throughout the whole thing carrying the beer flavor of it but the barley/corn flavor is more pronounced, but in a dry crisp actually malty way if that makes sense. It isn't syrupy sweet, and is actually refreshing to put down. Not as light as a ""light"" American beer, but going against all light colored lagers out there, this is pretty light in flavor. Light diacetyl once again, carried in the aftertaste.

Feel is actually solid light to medium body with a decent malty evolution. Not watery, but doesn't overstay its welcome. Good refresher.

Overall I don't understand all the hate on this beer. There's nothing innately wrong with it, it's cheap, and arguably better than most AALs out there. Not hoppy at all but the malt has actual character and the off flavors are forgivable and not some travesty of beer handling.",3.25

Sometimes while fixing a big breakfast I'll put a RR in the freezer for 15-20 min. then get it out and drink it with my meal(out of a chilled glass of course). I do like the taste, not bitter or over hoppy like some beers and at times it reminds me of my younger days.",4.0

It's very pale like Bud light, and head is gone in a flash, smells pretty decent and unique pleasing grassy ""fresh"" like a fabric softener sheet.

The Legendary Duff Beer,"Nov. 2010: 330 ml bottle, brewed by Eschweger, ABV in Norway is 4.7%. Bought at MENY Stadionparken. Crystal clear extremely pale yellow colour, big white head.

The Legendary Duff Beer,"Brewed in Germany, so must adhere to the purity law one would imagine.

I thought this stuff would be terrible as it is obviously a gimmick, however I was pleasantly surpisred. The beer is okay with half decent flavour, nothing to write home about though.

The Legendary Duff Beer,"330ml Can from a Prague Mini-Market (59CZK):
Clear, light amber with a large, foamy head that is bone-white and holds okay initially before holding at 0.5cm.

Grassy hops & some skunk on the nose initially. There was a very light & faint citrus aroma coming through with more water than I would have expected or liked, there was some bitterness too.

Basic and fairly cheap (despite the cost) pale lager with some light malts and grassy hops with some earthy tones and a hint of biscuit. There wasn't a lot going on really.

Light to thin bodied with a watery, quite bland feel but it still felt like a lager at least, albeit a light one. There was a faint citrus tang & a dry, moderately bitter finish as well.

Not all that enjoyable & purely a gimmick, not up to the standard of the much cheaper, & better Czech lagers that were for sale in the same shops as this one. The beer was thin & bland with nothing going for it really.",2.25
The Legendary Duff Beer,"A 330ml can with a BB of March 2014. ABV is stated as 4.7%. Given to me as a gift a little while back (from Switzerland). It's Duff - how can I resist trying it?

Poured into a pilsner glass. A clear golden colour with faint sediment and medium carbonation. Forms a decent head of white foam that lasts for a few minutes before disappearing. Some lacing. A subtle aroma of light, grainy malt with mild hints of stewed leaves and DMS. Slightly sweet and seriously bland.

Tastes of ultra-light malt with a crisp, dry finish. Notes of weak grain, mild stewed leaves and a twinge of cardboard in the background. Pretty clean, with a delicate bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, dry and tingly, with effervescent carbonation and a watery body. A very subtle aftertaste of light malt and stewed leaves/veg.

Not too much going on here, which I guess was to be expected. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are exceptionally bland and watery. Average body for a mass-produced lager. At least it's clean and inoffensive. Nothing technically wrong with it, but the lack of character makes for a dull drinking experience. No need to hunt it down.",2.75
The Legendary Duff Beer,"My neighbor and occasional trivia teammate travels for work on an infrequent basis, but he is always on the lookout for new CANs for me in furtherance of The CANQuest (TM). This is one of his recent acquisitions and I am quite excited about it!

I was hanging out in the alleyway with some of my neighbors, including Hank Hill, Boomhauer, Dale and Bill, drinking CANned Lone Star as is our usual wont when Dale mentions that one of his bowling league partners is coming by with beer. I was stunned when the guy's wife, sporting a huge, blue beehive, droped him off! He looked like That Yellow Bastard from ""Sin City"" and given his prodigious beer intake, I still wonder if he doesn't suffer from jaundice. His name was Homer and he had a huge cooler full of CANs of Duff Beer, which I heard was legendary, but I had never had any for myself. He was cool with allowing me to take one home for a review, especially after I turned him onto a Brewer's Art Ozzy in a CAN. We only ever drink CANs in the alley as the possibility of broken glass is not on in our circle.

I went with an inverted Glug following the Crack and got two-plus fingers of fizzing, foamy eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a golden-yellow (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity and my other drinking buds, Croesus, Mammon and King Midas were engaged in a fight to try some for themselves. Nose was clean, eliminating the possibility of it being an adjunct lager of any stripe. The nose had a hay field-like scent, intermingling the Noble hops with the malt nicely. Mouthfeel was medium and I got a pleasant, biscuity sweetness in the mouth and on the tongue. This was turning out to be much better than I would have imagined. I thought that it was going to be some crappy novelty but such was not the case, thank goodness. Finish was semi-dry thanks to their having found a good balance with the hops and malt and not allowing the malt to dominate as some examples of the style have, IMHO. I would drink it again, especially if that Homer guy shows up loaded for bear like he did today.",4.0
The Legendary Duff Beer,"Appearance: It pours a clear straw body with a two-finger head. It looks okay and the retention is better than expected.

Smell: A sweet malt and corn aroma are noticeable. It is missing the floral notes found in a good pilsener. To be honest, there really is not much of a smell to it.

Taste: A sweet malt flavor and the tiniest kick of hops can be detected. Otherwise there is not much to note.

Mouth feel: It is light bodied and watery. There is a slight dryness in the aftertaste but more is desired.

Overall: Like most people, I purchased this beer just for the novelty of it. Surprisingly, it was better than I expected. While a poor example of a German Pilsener, there really is nothing overly offensive about this beer. I was expecting a more medicinal grain alcohol flavor but none of that was apparent. In fact, it was probably one of the most neutral beers I've ever had. I probably would not buy it again but I have certainly had worse.",2.0

Feel is crisp but not clean, rather starchy on the palate, with some actual alcohol heat for 5.5%.

Overall, ""ice"" beers are a joke, but I was really surprised that at 5.5% this beer made absolutely no effort to disguise its alcohol content. This is a truly horribly made beer, and I'm being completely objective. A warming furnace to your throat and stomach at a measly 5.5% ABV.",1.75

Its little brother Genesee Light falls (and tastes) flat however.

Genesee Ice Beer,"Type: 24-oz can
Glass: Westvleteren 12 Trappist (for shits and giggles)
From: Grocery Outlet in Allied Gardens (San Diego), Calif.
Price: $1.19
Purchased: May 9, 2018
Consumed: May 10, 2018
Reviewed as: American Adjunct Lager
Misc.: No canned on date; #CraftAdjace

Picked a can up of this and regular Genesee Ice at Grocery Outlet after an eye appointment and realizing that I hadn’t reviewed Genesee Beer, Genny Light or this one (had never heard of a Genny Ice). Crazy. Genny Light was probably the beer I consumed the most in college unfortunately. Never even liked it then when it was High Falls Brewing and actually craft beer (I think), so really not expecting much. Being an ice beer, would be shocked if it reached a 2.25 for me. Description from their website read, “When you're looking for a rich, full-flavored beer, Genesee Ice is the perfect beer for you. Our brewmasters begin with only the purest natural ingredients. Then, ice crystals form in the beer during its aging process before it's filtered for the rich flavor Genesee Ice is known for.”

Poured a pale clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of off-white fizzy head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Below average watery lacing. Very bad retention. (Sight - 3.00)

Smelled apple, pear, purple grape, grain, corn, hints of cinnamon (really?), cereal and slight skunkiness. Pretty much the same from the can with maybe more booze, skunkiness and hints of vomit. (Smell - 2.75)

Taste was pretty bland overall. Thought it would be boozier. Got wet grain, corn, cereal, apple, slight herbal and cooked vegetables. Much better than I thought it would taste. (Taste - 2.75)

Light body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt finish. Got worse as it went down. (Feel - 2.25)

Better than I thought, but not quite as good as the regular Genesee beer. (Overall - 2.50)

Poured into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, medium to dark golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continuously rising to the beer's surface. Has a white head that's over an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a nice, thick, creamy looking layer of surface with good lacing. Aromas of some lightly breaded malts, a bit of apple, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is pretty the same, with some lightly breaded caramel malts with a bit of sweetness that gives way to some graininess and a bit of grassy corn. Unfortunately this also has a bit of a metallic adjunct flavor. Not really an discernible hop flavor here. Has a fairly crisp, yet smooth, light to medium bodied mouth feel. Has a clean finish with a slightly dry and somewhat metallic aftertaste. I've had better beers of this style and I've certainly had worse.

First nip, kind of bland. From the can, bland, metallic. Grainy, corn, slighty sweet. Not all that good. Might be alright sittin out back with one of my Parodi cigars. I like the look of the old school can, the color of the beer is the best thing going for it. For 99 cent you cant go wrong.",2.5

Coors Extra Gold,"Extra Gold Lager is a rich, full-flavored lager with a deep golden color.

Likely typical lager finishing hops because this beer is ALL LAGER. If it was in a clear Miller High Life bottle with a redesign it would go from lawnmower beer to the top of the domestic lager game. It's a robust, beautiful, full, crisp, clean, and perfect example of an American Lager. Slow-brewed to produce this truly refined lager in an unassuming packaging at an unassuming price. If I were PR I would repitch it with a marketing strategy and get back to basics. They're too bloated and monopolized to realize a blind test would put them in the top 5 American Lagers.

Smells like it has a bit of some sour mash, maybe like sour malts. Got it! With that bread like lager smell this smells like a sourdough bread. Love it or leave it.

The taste is pretty unremarkable or shocking. Tastes like a macro lager with a hint of sour. The sour is not offensive or overpowering. There is a bit of some sweet coming into play as well.

Mouth is a bit more towards medium with that unusual sour and sweet. Finishes easy with just a bit of oiliness.

Overall not a bad beer but more of what I would call it an inexpensive beer. Found this in a Colorado liquor store for 16.99 when I went back to Denver for a bit.

Coors Banquet beer will always be tops in my book, but Extra Gold still features the same signature Coors taste that makes this brand so popular, despite poor sales in 2018. Its light, corny, and easy on the ABV, which makes for a great summer time brew. In the age of flavorful craft beer, there is still a place for the macro American lager on certain occaisions.

To the eye, this stuff actually looks a lot better than your typical lager. Deep golden color; very active with tiny little bubbles constantly floating topside; minimal, foamy white head that never fully dissipates. My sniffer is a bit off thanks to suffering through a cold this week, but it's picking up quite a bit of corny sweetness.

Coors Extra Gold,"I've lived in Denver for over 20 years and drank Coors Extra Gold for years mainly because my wife liked it and it is about the cheapest beer you can buy ($17 for a 30 pack). But after drinking it so long for picnics and steaks on the grill over the years, I discovered it is really not a bad brew! It certainly does not compare with a fine craft beer. But after years of drinking it, it has become my favorite go-to beer. I don't think any mass produced beer compares. My wife and I have done taste comparisons with Stella and Heneken and we both think CEG has them beat by a mile. What I like is that it has a slight ""bite"" that I especially like. What I can't understand is (1) why does Coors sell this beer so cheap? (2) Why is this beer not advertised by Coors? (3) Why is it only available (in the Denver market) in cans? (4) Why is it only available in certain markets? I think Coors underestimates Coors Extra Gold.",3.5

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a crystal clear dark gold color with a one finger white head that faded unusually slowly to leave a creamy halo and a thin blanket. Uhhmmm...wut? There is even some nice lacing. I don't think I've ever had a macro or adjunct lager had a head that stayed like this. Almost like a pilsner. What the...

S - Aromas of lightly sweet malts, roasted/toasted corn. Much more of a toasted corn note than the usual BMC. Little grassy note. Most corn forward macro I've smelled that also didnt have a syrupy note to it. Err...ooookaaayyy... Not entirely sure if I got a super 'fresh' can or what but this is the best smelling adjunct lager I've come across. For what it is this is thoroughly impressive.

T - Taste is sweeter malts, more of that toasted corn. No metallic taste though nor am I getting any syrupy or skunked notes. Tastes like I assume what a bowl of soggy day old cornflakes with water instead of milk would taste like with maybe a little bit of bread soaked in there too. It's corn water, sure, but there aren't any 'off' flavors here. Also it's not overly sweet by any stretch of the imagination which other than maybe Schiltz 60's formula makes this the only macro I've had that wasn't super sweet. It still is what it is though, corn water.

M - Mouthfeel is the usual crisp, watery self but because it's not sweet or syrupy it comes across as rather refreshing.

O - Overall...what the hell is going on? This really is shockingly good. Of course it doesn't hold a candle to IPAs or any other style for that matter but this is like comparing a junkyard beater to a nice car on the lot. Sure, the lot car is going to be a hell of a lot nicer but they both get you from point A to point B. And unlike other junkyard cars (macro BMC lagers) this one, for what it is, actually isn't half bad. Certainly would not be my beer of choice if offered just about any craft beer, however, I would take this over any other adjunct lager or macro beer out there. Maybe I got lucky and got a good can of it but man, reviewing based totally on the style, this is leaps and bounds ahead of all the others. My world is shook.

Coors Extra Gold,"OK...I get it. Not everyone is, or has been flocking to consume this beer. However, for those thousands of semi-disillusioned drinkers of standard ""go to beers"", (i.e. Bud heavy, Bud light, Coors Light, Miller, Corona, etc.), this is an excellent ""go to beer"" that I have enjoyed for about 30 years or so. [Sidebar - It was great in a bottle; wish it was available on draft!] There is a reason why this beer has endured for so long. Not many even know of its existence, (due to lack of major marketing efforts), but thanks to word of mouth, beer drinkers are pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong; I absolutely LOVE and support the top-end beers with all the bells & whistles, but this beer (for the price and taste), ain't all that bad. Just sayin'!",4.0
Coors Extra Gold,"Same place I got the other few. Dented can for $1. Never knew Coors brewed another lager and to be quite honest I don't expect much out of this one at all.

Pours the typical dehydrated urine yellow with a large bone white head that sticks around for an eternity leaving crater upon crater in the glass.

Smells like Coors banquet though there is something rather..papery about this one.

Follows the typical AAL suit though there is a touch of wheat which makes it a bit better until that odd wet papery flavors comes through.

Feel is light bodied with a boat load of carbonation. Swallows easy and the wheaty aspect becomes a bit more prominent as it sits around the mouth.

Overall just another generic AAL. The wheat would have made it above average had the paper not been a throw off in the flavor and nose. Oh well. Worth a dollar. Random gas station brews are all gone, time to kill these last four Dorados.",2.75
New,Terrible but a bit less terrible than Crown Lager,1.5
New,"Tooheys New. The pride of New South Wales. ANother mainstream Aussie adjunct lager, it's a NSW icon, much like VB is to Victoria, XXXX Queensland, Emu Export to WA and West End to SA. It's not something i've had in a while, as previously I found it too sweet for my liking. But let's give it a fair crack...

Look: Standard Aussie Macro lager. Deep Golden Straw, filtered, highly carbonated. Head was non existent and has faded to a thin foam on top. Lots of cascading bubbles rising to the top. Standard stuff.

Smell: Wet grassy hops, from the standard Pride of Ringwood hops, which also gives a slight sour lemon/citrus nose, pale malt sweetness. Smells like an Aussie adjunct lager

Taste: Heavy biscuit malt and grain flavour throughout the sip, a tiny fizz of bitterness towards the end with a slight citrus twang. Pretty clean and smooth. Carbonation is heavy, and takes over the flavour of the beer quickly.

Feel: Highly carbonated, so refreshing when drunk ice cold. It's clean, easy drinking especially if you're just after something to drink without thinking about complex flavours.

Overall: it's better than what I remember from my young adult days of drinking this stuff because it was one of the cheaper options on the market, but it's pretty bland to be honest. There's not a lot going on flavour profile wise, and the heavy carbonation does not assist in keeping the flavours around. Having said that, you need to drink this ice cold - much like VB as once it warms up it starts to turn proper funky. A decent enough lager to quaff quickly on a hot summers day,",2.5
New,"Pours pale golden with plenty of carbonation rising. Decent 1 finger head that has good lasting power.

Aroma of corn, light malt and slightly bready.

Taste is of light malt, corn, and somewhat grassy. Rather sweet. Tastes better than expected (expectations were low).

Mouthfeel is light body and lightly cleansing. Somewhat dry in the mouth.

Overall, a decent hot weather beer. Maybe slightly better for the style than most. Still, nothing to get too excited about.",2.75

New,"Format: a mid-brown 375mL stubby with the age-old Tooheys New macro label.

Appearance: a solid amber in colour with plenty of chunky macro lager carbonation. A finger of white head drops to a thick cap. Sporadic lacing.

Aroma: an aroma of proper grain (rather than cheap grain and adjuncts). Better than most macro lagers.

Taste: again a touch better with those same flavours - Tooheys New surprises me a little whenever I have it (which is rare). There is a reason why this and VB are two of the most-bought macro lagers in the country.

Aftertaste: more grains and husk here with the slightest touch of hop bitterness. Some sweetness too from indistinct origins.

Mouth feel: moderate in feel with a higher carbonation to bring through that fantastically refreshing crispness.

Overall: Tooheys New continues to surprise me when I occasionally drink it. It is one of the standard Aussie macro lagers, but there is a reason it is one of the mainstays in Australian pubs. It is a definite cut above most standard cheap macro lagers, and decent at AU$45 for a case of 24 x 375mL stubbies. Most importantly, one of my favourite pub beers wouldn't be an option without New (a 50/50 - or Black n Tan for you Americans - with half Tooheys Old and half Tooheys New).",3.25

L - Clear amber with a one-finger sudsy off-white head. Actually great lacing.
S - Sweet, but not in a sugary way. Herbal. Some kind of fruit, but I can't pin down which one.
T - It tastes like literal raw sugar cane, minus most of the sweetness - but I can tell it's sweet, if that makes any sense at all. Almost tastes of granny smith apple skin, but then it doesn't. A somewhat metallic finish. It doesn't taste objectively bad, though.
F - Medium-light body with nitro-like carbonation. Refreshing. Wet. Crisp.
O - This beer's flavor HAS to be an acquired taste. Not for the reason I see many people drinking it (I don't), but because it doesn't taste bad, but for the reason that I'm not familiar with the flavors present. It's this non-cloying sweetness, with some sort of herbal vibe, minus the herbs. It almost tastes like a sassafras soda, but not in any sort of ""exact"" sense. It's almost like Malta Goya, but swap the Raisin Bran flavor with some mysterious flavor you've never had that can only be in the area of ""molasses"" - but not really.

Palma Louca Pale Pilsner,"Pours a slghtly milky-opaque yellow-orange. Very short-lived,3/8"" white head,despite an aggressive pour.A tiny bit of lacing ringing the edge of the glass..

Aroma is almost not there. Has a very slight sour/boozy/yeasty aroma, reminiscent of the tail end of the aroma of a quad. This is a very recent arrival, so I assume it is fairly fresh, and it's not spoiled or old.

The taste is very slight , and mix of tangerine,pineapple, and rye bread, with a slight sour tang. Took half the bottle to get a enough taste to dissect it. Nothing overly offensive in the taste, just very little of it. That might be a good thing, and the ""Taste"" rating reflects that. :)

Carbonation is fine-textured, and pleasantly prickly. There is a strange after-feel on the mid to back tongue, and roof of the mouth. Sort of sticky, and chalky, almost as if a piece of damp,rough cardboard has been rubbed around, and then left stuck to the back of the tongue. A rougher communion wafer? : )

Overall, probably OK on a hot summer day, when there are no other options. Drink it quickly though, because it only gets worse as it warms.

Decent looker. Clear and with a bit of fine carbonation, much of it racing quite quickly. Head creation is a bit soapy, not unlike your typical pils, a simple soapy three finger head manages to settle to a bubbled thin puck and collar. Pretty much alright in the looks department.

There's a weird aroma going on here. Flaked maize and corny smelling a bit for a German pils and comes off more like a basic American Pale Lager. Quite sweet, a bit of vegetation and quite macro smelling. Not too many off flavors detectable at least, but not really giving up the goods here either.

Woah.. Where did that body go. Surprisingly and exceptionally wet and almost rice bodied light in mouthfeel that does nothing to get a classic pils let alone a corn lager come through.

The scent at first was wet hay or grass, then rice. The problem here is it's nearly tasteless! That is, it doesn't offend, it's crisp but not ""beery"" no hops, no barley malt, perhaps just fermented Rice Krispies! No lingering aftertaste. Best point, you can drink all you can stand to drink!",3.0
Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,"There are not many N.A. beers in a CAN remaining for me to try, if you CAN believe it. O'Doul's Amber and Old Style L.A. are the only two that I am still aware of that have not been part of The CANQuest (TM).

My pour produced two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a foul rankness, like rotting vegetable matter. No kidding, it would have gagged a maggot! Ooof. The mouthfeel was thin, kind of watery and the taste remninded me of Wheaties, albeit fermented. Not a pleasant taste. The underside of the CAN read ""SEP 27 2010"" so freshness was not a factor in this gag-a-thon. Finish left me with buyer's/drinker's remorse and not much beyond that. I believe that this was my seventh or eighth N.A. beer on The CANQuest (TM) and it was hands-down the worst!",2.0
Old Milwaukee Non Alcoholic,"Quite possibly the worst ""beer"" I've had ever. Drank straight from a 12 oz can.

Yanjing Beer,"I had this beer in China and it was my personal favourite. Liked it better than the other Chinese beers. Easy drinking and nice and strong. It's typically drunk when you're eating spicy Asian food. The general reason is that it helps to clear the palate in a refreshing hydrating way so you can move on to the next spicy dish. That's probably the reason why it's so popular in China especially for Chinese food banquets. So if you're having spicy Asian food, you really cannot go wrong with this beer. It is in my opinion, a hidden gem that I was glad to discover.",4.75
Yanjing Beer,I normally do not do lagers but this one was pretty good. It’s complex and has a sweetness or fruitiness I couldn’t peg. I’d get again.,3.25
Yanjing Beer,"12oz bottle from Brewers Haven. Very pale gold, with a nice tight, rocky head, lots of lacing. Grainy, malty aroma, some corn. Taste is sweet, and more grainy flavors, and lacking any vegetal notes you usually get with cheap lagers. Tasty, smooth, light.",3.25
Yanjing Beer,"Let’s be real: the beer is what it is. I’m not going to call it a Chinese Heineken, but it still isn’t gonna win me over like Kiera Knighlty in a nightie. What I like is that my homeboy down the street at the liquor store told me to put it in the freezer for 20 minutes before I pop it. And you know what I got? Ice cold nothing! Which is better than regular cold skunk.

I’ll drink to that!

Yanjing Beer,"Decanted from an 11.2 oz (330 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; no production information.
A: Pours a crystal clear, straw to golden color with a two finger, foamy white head, decent retention, but spotty lacing at first, although it picks up lower on the glass.
S: Peppery and toasty with grainy (especially corn) and grassy aromas.
T: Semidry. Fruity (apple and corn) and very lightly malty with a surprising degree of bitterness given the style and area of origination.
M: Light bodied with very solid carbonation. Drinks smoothly, crisply, and cleanly.
O: This is a solidly constructed lager without being stand out. It is no longer in the clear bottle, as depicted above, but rather in a green one (which is no improvement from the perspective of skunking. The absence of a production date is a problem, especially as it is an import and trying hard to penetrate the American market.",3.5

Yanjing Beer,"Yup, here's Beijing's version of Bud, although it isn't AS grainy.

The beer is clear straw color but leaves a small, big-bubbled head

Yanjing Beer,"Poured into a small pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fizzy, one finger white head that dissipates to patches and a slender ring around the glass. Aroma of adjunct malt, faint grassy hops and apple; a hint of caramel. Amazingly, no skunkiness despite a green bottle. Flavor is sweet adjunct malt (the mild sweetness suggests rice), apple and pear juice, faint caramel and grassy hops. Medium bodied with a mild creaminess, above average for an adjunct. A more classic American adjunct profile than many other off-shore lagers of this style, with the pleasant mild sweetness and neutral malt. Flavor is steady throughout the taste with little drop off in the finish. The adjuncts are slightly sweeter and the fruit notes slightly more noticeable than a domestic, but overall shows off the bland, but consistent flavor that has made this a world dominating style (at least for a while). This is so similar to a domestic mass market beer it is puzzling why it would be a good candidate for import, but whatever. It gave me another Chinese beer to try, and I'm not expecting to get a craft one from there. Full satisfactory and drinkable for an adjunct lager. Kudos to the shippers and warehouses that kept this green bottled lager in the dark and drinkable.",3.25
Yanjing Beer,"This is the beverage of choice when I'm in Beijing. I go for this when the choices are hot tea, hot water, hot soup, room temp fruit nectar or cold Yanjing.

Or maybe not.

Green bottle. Pours dark for a pilsener and initially very fizzy, but the head dies away quickly and the beer becomes still.

Smells mildly, pleasantly skunked. Like a european import from the late 90s or early 2000s, before freshness became an issue and everything got packed in darker glass. It's a dumbly nostalgic smell, and while I like it I realize it is not objectively all that good.

Tastes... okay. It's aged, but there's more going on here than in the other mass produced east-Asian pils I've had. Mild skunk up front, a thick and lively grainbill in the middle, and a sweet and slightly stale finish of fruit.

Fresh, this would probably be pretty good. Stale, it's still ok.",3.5

Yanjing Beer,"The poured beer doesn't look very good, the head disappears rather quickly, but the aroma and the taste are decent. This one is more hoppy than most Chinese beers, and doesn't taste as watered down or sweet. The feel is a bit over carbonated in my opinon, making the drink feel more like a soda than a beer.",3.0
Yanjing Beer,"Pours out into a Duvel glass a clear bright yellow color with a 1/2"" snow white head that soon recedes to a ring around the glass and a thin layer of foam with a patch here and there on the sides of the glass. Sipping leaves some widely scattered speckles and legs of lacing. If there had been some foam around to the end of the beer the score would probably have been higher.

The aroma initially has a slight touch of skunk that quickly disappears and so will not be factored into the rating score because that is a retailer storage issue not a brewing issue. The aroma is quite faint but has hints of malt and what may be hops.

The light, subtle flavors initially tend toward the sweet side but then quickly become dry, as one would expect from the use of rice as an adjunct. There is really no noticable bitterness

The mouth feel is on the light side of medium and the slight prickly feel from carbonation only lasts for about half the beer. The finish is reasonably long, begins in the light malt sweetness and then tapers off into dryness.

Overall this is a drinkable beer for people who are thirsty and don't want much flavor in their beer. Doing several in an evening would not be a problem, but for myself I want something with more flavor than this offers.",3.0
Yanjing Beer,"A: It's clear gold, with a head that rapidly disappears, and small bubbles.

T : It's like slightly bitter flavored water. A little rice taste, and a little grass, but that's about it.

It looks like a regualr pils beer, although much lighter. It has a very unfresh smell, and the flavor is awful. Can't really put my finge rto what it is eaxctly, but I never tatsed something like that before. The beer also leaves a very penetrating flavor and felling in the mouth Definitely the worst beer I ever drank.",1.0
Cara Pils,"Cara Pils is generally drank because it is the cheapest beer available in the Belgian market. Thus is carries a bit of a stigma in Belgium. People drink this for the sale purpose of getting drunk as cheaply as possible when they have absolutely no money. It is crap but it is ridiculously cheap. I mean, really, really cheap, buying an equal amount of water at the supermarket costs more money than this beer.

Second note, I believe that Piedboeuf doesn’t brew this. No one actually brews Cara Pils, they just buy this stuff from whatever brewery makes it the cheapest. Sometimes contracts change, I have heard that they put failed batches from several pils brewers into this stuff, probably including stuff from Piedboeuf. The French brewery Champigneulles (TCB Beverages) who specializes in this kinds of beers most likely makes most of this stuff, these days.

But compared to world famous 'beers' like Heineken, it can still hold its own.
On any given summer sunday I prefer an ice cold Cara over most popular pilseners.

Sure, the taste is not great, it tastes somewhere in between foul and average, but at the bargain price of 0,26€/33cl, this is to be expected. Bad image aside, this is just a regular pilsener, which would be much better liked if it was branded better.",2.5
Cara Pils,"Purchased at a convenience store in Brugge late at night partially out of late night desperation, partially to see if a Belgian beer is capable of sucking. 33 cl can, .50 Euro. Dated 01-13. Intersting that a freshness date on a pils would be that far out. Tastes like a cheap pilsner, but not as bad as expected. I suppose it is only bad when compared against all other beer in Belgium but when compared to beer all over the world, actually not so terrible. Probably need to remove the word ""premiere"" from the can.",2.0
Cara Pils,"Ah Cara pils, I'm not going to do a detailed review for this brew. This is probably the worst Belgian beer. The smell reminds you of cat urine and the taste isn't any beter. This is the cheapest beer you can get here, so it is not really brewed for a good taste. It is unsurprisingly not popular in Belgium, it's main customers are people who want to get drunk and want to do that as cheap as possible. One can of Cara is about 25 eurocents (about 33 U.S. cents using todays exchange rates).

In my student club, drinking a can of cara ad fundum is even considered a punishment at a cantus. Even so, try one if you never had any before because something this bad gives you a lot of appreciation for breweries that do deliver good products all year round.",1.0
Cara Pils,"Ah, talk about memories of Belgium! Nothing more epitomizes the day-to-day, I-save-all-my-money-for-beer-but-only-buy-the-cheapest existence of an adolescent exchange student than a can of lukewarm Cara-Pils! An exchange student friend of mine brought this back for me from a recent trip back to Liege as a token of our...um...friendship.

I almost laughed as I took the care to pour it into my pint glass, a sign of respect this beer should never be afforded. It's appearance is pale yellow and practically transparent, clear as day. It fizzes like a can of Coke and, if poured a little too hastily, can foam up like a bubble bath of malt-stricken death. In my particular case, I poured slowly enough to keep the foam under control, though it still takes a while to subside (which is, oddly enough for a beer, something you sort of want it to do). Is it even worth mentioning lacing? I didn't think so... A sip is like an assault on the mouth, for lack of a more original metaphor. The carbonation so apparent in the head is no less powerful in the taste, effectively shocking the tongue into submission- bending it over and pulling down its pants to prepare it for the horror to come, so to speak. The taste would be called weak if it wasn't for the sickening malt flavor that coats the palate in a godawful slime that can only be removed by repeatedly brushing your teeth. Hops are nowhere to be found, and are instead replaced by a blatant and offensive alcohol kick that just exacerbates the carbonation... violation.

I was glad to see this beer only for the stomach-churning sentimentality it inspired in me and the pleasure I knew I would derive from writing this review. It's the Belgian college student's 40 of OE, the alcoholic's plastic bottle of Georgi. To my friend's credit, at least he brought me a Rodenbach Grand Cru to sweeten the deal.",1.0

Taste is slightly sour malt, biscuit. Faint hop bitterness, more bitter salad greens, slight metallic twang. Carbonation is high, and the body is quite watery. But at least there is some hop presence here?

I've had worse. It doesn't compete with Krombacher--which I would consider the standard-bearer of NA beers--but it's recognizably beery and not outright offensive.

Warsteiner Premium Fresh,For the record...,2014.0
Warsteiner Premium Fresh,"330ml bottle, a single found at my local Superstore, of all places - who knew? Apparently they have broken cases too.

This beer pours a crystal clear, pale golden straw hue, with two fingers of puffy, moderately foamy, and bubbly off-white head, which leaves a decent array of layered deciduous tree lace around the glass as it lazily subsides.

It smells of warm grainy, somewhat pungently cereal-heavy malt (weirdly common for the 'style', it seems), a slight flinty mineral character, and tame earthy, weedy hops. The taste is more of the same - cereal-prominent malt, a certain hard-water essence, and leafy, earthy hops. Simple, but quite beer-like, surprisingly, as if I hadn't played this game before.

The carbonation is average - supportive and a tad peppy - the body an adequate medium weight, and smooth in the most general of senses. It finishes off-dry, the breakfast cereal essence still rather undeniable, the noble hops not altogether interested in the affair by now, leaving us with another version of this foreign dominance unchecked and unheeded at my grocery chain border.

I'd like to opine that this is so obviously an NA beer, but I just can't. The maltiness is just so superior to many of the pale lagers out there - noticeable, enjoyable, and well, not boozy. So why can't a whole lot of the normals get that part right? No offense to Warsteiner - they've no doubt got their shit together, like many of their German kin.",3.0

The coloring looks really good. It is a bright golden color with really light foam. It leaves some pretty decent lacing on the pilsner glass.

I smell a lot of bright, pilsner flavor in this glass. There seems to be a pretty decent amount saaz hops in this glass.

The flavor is where the beer really falls short. It is all hop and no balance. Then I get a pretty decent amount of dry mouth.

I'm glad I got this style out of the way. Now I can go back to drinking great new styles.",2.5

I dunno, I mean, there are originality points, but then there are drawback points as well in that regard. Maybe its a wash. Aroma was like, nothing. Seltzer water. Could have been some psychosomatic feels making me think I could smell that citrus.

Taste is like a very low alcohol seltzer water with sugar added. Not pulling any lemon or lime flavors out of it like most clear carbonated beverages. Mouth feel isn't anything that smacks of barley. Or hops. This is really straining credulity to assign it the label of beer. With that said, there is nothing horribly tasting about it, it just doesn't really come to mind as something you want to drink when you want a beer.

Pale to straw colored gold with real nice clarity, and reams of fine carbonation. The head is straight up styrofoam but actually has real decent retention and some staying power. Lingers with a big bright white fine bubbled top off three fingers for just a short enough bit to stay interesting.

Aroma has a real cereal grain flavor, and somewhat muted dextrose corn like sense. There's a whispy like clean quality to this, but doesn't have a sense of big sugar either. Comes off in a somewhat balanced way, but also strangely smells a little like burnt vegetative notes.

Palate is actually charming in some ways. Light bodied definitely wet but holds just enough and doesn't go for a syrupy corn rush either. Palate has a light sweeetness and non existent hop content. Mild sweet corn finish but also a simple clean touch that makes for real easy drinking.

It has characteristics of a brown ale but real subtle. Smells a bit like sweet corn in a way and is overall an enjoyable beer. Keep in mind that there isnt much of a comparison to craft beers but like someone said in a previous review, adjunct lagers should have their own designated area on Beer Advocate in order for commercial adjunct beers to receive a truer and more accurate rating and review. When compared to craft beer all the beers above suck. They really should be moved into a category of their own even though they are both beers. There's too much of a difference in them. I enjoy some adjunct lagers as much as I do craft beers and it's kinda not fair for all of the adjuncts to be under 70 in the ratings. Only fair to separate them",4.0

Overall: A decent lager here. It definitely still has the adjunct flavors, but also more of a breadiness than other light/adjunct lagers. The mouthfeel is quite nice, but with the flavor of Coors light. Not as much corn adjuncts as Miller. A decent offering here. (Rating:",4.0
Coors Banquet,"Recently I found myself on a journey to see if I could find any adjunct lager that could displace PBR as my favorite. Having tried now ~25 of the style, there are only a couple that meat that criteria. MHL and this one. The look is not terribly impressive, with a cap of foam that disappears during a blink. But the aromas and flavors are not only not off-putting, but downright inviting to me. Lots of sweet malty corn dominate with an undetectable hop presence that must balance this perfectly as it finishes very clean and begs for another sip. Yum.",4.25
Coors Banquet,"I feel like there needs to be a separate category for these US adjunct beers. Comparing a Coors to a craft DIPA is, as the old saying goes, apples to oranges. As a craft beer lover, I still have an appreciation for beers I grew up watching our grandfathers, uncles, and dads drink. I have come to enjoy Coors Banquet in cans again. Much more enjoyable than Budweiser for me. Not a fan of Coors Light, but when I’m mowing the lawn, hanging by the pool, I’ll take. Coors “Yellowjacket” any day!",3.0
Coors Banquet,"Poured from a pint can into a pint glass. Somehow it fit.

The look on the pour is at first enticing until it quickly becomes what it really is. When I cracked the can head almost exploded out of the top and as I poured almost 2 fingers of head formed. That quickly recedes fast enough that I can get the whole pint into a pint glass right up to the rim without spilling. Color is a tad darker than just pale straw with a steady flow of small bubbles wandering their way to the surface.

Aroma is what you'd expect. Dominated by lager yeast and skunked hops, there is a hint of crackery malts peeking through but it's hard to enjoy when the hops have essentially gone rancid in this one. Not as bad as the Miller genuine draft I had but pretty bad.

The taste is slightly better with actual malt sweetness and some breadiness, and a lot less fermentation character, however the offness is still there. Its drinkable but not crisp. It's honestly almost sweet.

The feel is what is nailed here. Strong bite from carbonation but enough head comes back to give it decent body and the feel is honestly refreshing. Not bad when you look back it pairs with the malty sweetness quite well.

But overall, you go in to take another sip and are reminded that something is wrong here. Weather it's an old can which is weird seeing as it's a cheap single in lower income area, but who knows. Maybe I could get a better coors and I remember a better coors but this is just off.",2.75
Coors Banquet,"Coors original, my all time favorite cheap beer. You can find it anywhere and it's like $20 for a pack of 30. No craft beer can compare to that price point.

Beck's Non-Alcoholic,"Had with a meal in Germany, as there were no ""real"" beers in the house and I had never tried an NA beer before. Frankly it's a bit bizarre and there's definitely something missing taste-wise. That being said, it's not bad at all. I just have no desire to drink another one.",3.0
Beck's Non-Alcoholic,"Pours a crystal clear golden color. Thick 3-4 finger sudsy white head forms on the beer before dissipating. Thin layer of velvety foam remains on the top of the beer. Aroma has notes of sweet grains, a slight skunkiness, light herbal hops. Again, its very reminiscent of a Beck's.

Taste follows the nose with notes of sweet grainy malts, a moderate skunkiness that becomes more pronounced as it warms up. There is a very light wortiness to the profile, but its very subtle. Feel is light, crisp, easy drinking. Bright carbonation.

This is a solid NA version of the regular beer.",3.5

Beck's Non-Alcoholic,"Pours a translucent pale yellow with a finger of white foam. Aroma is dank, like walking into a backwoods, dispensary dank. Aside from the dank, is light resiny hops and pale malts, but really it's just dank. Flavor profile is, you guessed it, hella dank. It's dank from top to bottom, with a little resiny hops and pale malts for some extra depth. Mouth feel is crisp with thin consistency leading to a refreshing sip. Overall, dank can't be understated here, but otherwise, a refreshing glass of NA beer.

Served in a chilled pint from a bottle.",3.5
Beck's Non-Alcoholic,"Pours a clear transparent straw colour with very small head and minimal lacing.

Smell is pretty unremarkable, slightly malty but not much else there.

Beck's Non-Alcoholic,"Look: Clear gold with some rising carbonation bubbles. Half a finger of fizzy white head that quickly dissipates.

Smell: Horrible, awful, skunked. The green bottle makes this virtually inevitable.

Taste: Extremely mild but extremely sweet malt. Except for a mild bitterness without flavor that crops up a few seconds after swallowing,I would be surprised if a hop ever went near this bottle.

Beck's Non-Alcoholic,"(12 oz bottle, best before end 05.2020; purchased cold single... poured into 14 oz mug)

L: crystal-clear, pale gold liquid, light dusting of speckled sediment floating; another picture-perfect, craggy bulge of frothy foam... drapes of lace all over; thick collar and partial cap holds

S: first impression is a maibock - one with blue hyssop overtones... I was hoping it would smells like Beck's regular, but it does have a subtle emphasis on malt with the alcohol obviously greatly reduced... hmm, almost smells like a pils; relatively potent aromas at any rate

T: Bavarian soft pretzel underbelly with a humming static of spicy herbal hop and phenols buzzing atop... by the second sip, a lot more malt swells; the aftertaste has a doughy pretzel note, almost with a hint of salt(?!)... full-flavored attack; maybe a tad starchy sweet on the back end... malty dough and subtle bitterness linger for awhile; relatively dry

F: frothy texture covering up the sluggish, weak worty flow... does finish with a dry fade, but lips and inner cheeks be smacking

O: interesting - I can sort of taste Beck's in this... noticeable differences between this and the Heineken 0.0 I just tried; way more malty malt with this one... not all that bad, but it almost tastes like the malt is waiting to be converted to ethanol (1477)",3.75

Beck's Non-Alcoholic,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 3/2018. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of cardboard-like aromas/flavors from the NA process, but not overwhelming. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Overall this is a nice NA pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and pretty refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish.

I am a beer lover, and at times in my life have been required to stop alcohol consumption (during the course of 4 pregnancies). During my first pregnancy, this was extremely miserable for me because the available beers were alternate versions of the beers i already didn't enjoy at all. Beck's non-alcoholic is a breakthrough! It actually has a taste that is like regular beer. It tastes very similar to beck's with alcohol.

Bavaria 8.6 Original,"The local bottle shop near me stock some of these strong European lagers, which are good on a Friday night, when you want to get your buzz on, and not think too hard about the present, future, or past. They've started stocking this one, so thought I'd pick up a can and give it a go.

Look: Clear, very bubbly golden beer, looking like a classic Australian adjunct lager, rather than a typical pale Euro lager. Frothy white head that has more important places to be than my glass by the way it's disappearing as I type this.

Smell: Strong alcohol whiff on the nose, bitter grassy hops, somewhat sour on the nose, biscuit malt. Smells like a hangover in the making.

Taste: Sweet syrupy goo. It's like they've poured a lot of simple syrup and mixed it with straight alcohol. Struggling to find anything positive about the flavour, might be some hop extract in there somewhere, but if it is they've mixed with with simple syrup and turned it into a hop cordial.

Feel: Smooth, not overly carbonated, but sickly sweet.

Overall: 20th review, and this is the first one I'm proper regretting. I've had OJ strong, and from memory that's more palatable, this is just beer cordial. I look on the can and sure enough, it lists hop extract, and glucose syrup. 1-2 cans may get you buzzed, but heck, I'd rather drink a 6 pack of an average Aussie adjunct lager than force myself to down this. Better drink it ice cold, because once it warms up, it's going to be completely undrinkable.

It is basically a beer called a name that is its alcohol content, by Dutchies. The crazy mofos...how creative...

Look is rather see-through and piss like. Fizz lasts about the same time as piss also.

Aroma is like a pub at 5AM combined with ash-trays.

Taste..? Definitely no balance between the flavours and alcohol. Too much carbon dioxide. And ash tray. I am certain that someone has emptied ash trays in this beer...it was not me.

Though is it bad or really bad..? It's close to really bad, though I shall still drink it all anyway. Though the taste is actually better than the 5 AM cigarette butt aroma.

Would I drink if I was homeless..? For sure. There is fuck all else to do and I probably do not want to break another tooth opening a bottle of Chimnay Bleu.

Also it seems to have made me cough. Seriously, do not buy unless you are homeless or like me and are testing it to warn other people.

Instead, have a Polish Mocjne or Belgian beer

And I do not smoke in case you were wondering...neither has my beer chalise ever been used as an ashtray, until now

Now, I’m trying it again and it’s still good...it’s nice and cold & easy to drink and still has that lemony after-taste, which gives it a summertime appeal, but it is pretty thin in taste. The ABV is 4.6 so it gets you where you wanna go, put it isn’t much in flavor.

Stops comparing it to sierra nevada IPA its in the class with the beers that put hair on your chests like miller lite and coors lite.",4.5

Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,"I bought a can at the lcbo in Ontario 473ml at 5%.
my can was very fresh the letter E which stands for May 2021 brewed .
poured a 2finger head into glass that was leaving a lace as you drink it.
I expected more sweetness when I see India pale ale on the can but it's not that sweet at all .
overall it's an easy drinking beer more like a lagered ale then a IPA beer to me .

Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,"When I was on my first date with my ex we went to a rotating restaurant. He said we're there for a beer and we're going on a scavenger hunt. This was our first and last date in the 2 years that we were together. I asked the waitress what beers were on tap, and she named 15 types and I just said Alexander Keiths. My ex's eyes lit up and he said that his eyes lit up. Later he told me that that was one of the moments he knew he loved me. He's a douchebag so that shows this beers quality. Left a sour taste in my mouth, even though the beer was not sour. 5 Smirnoff Ices/10",2.5

Bit of a scam to call this an IPA. Nothing IPA about it
Its a half decent beer but it is not an IPA

No lacing, no head. Just a bit better than a Coors light",2.0
Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,"A: The beer is crystal clear yellow in color and has a light to moderate amount of carbonation. It poured with a finger high frothy white head that died down a bit but never completely faded away.
S: Faint aromas of sweet malt extracts and caramel are preset in the nose.
T: The taste follows the smell and is a bit sweet with hints of caramel-like flavors. No bitterness is perceptible.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and clean on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer seems to be very watered down for an IPA and has more of a mouthfeel that I would expect from a Euro Pale Lager than a beer in this style. The smell and taste also seem to be muted.

Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale,"Pretty bad. I took a sip and said ""this is an IPA?"" No body to it, slight corn and citrus taste, getting nothing on the finish.

Stroh's,"Poured out of a 12 oz can into one of my pint glasses, this beer pours a clear, pale medium golden color with lots of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continually rising to the beer's surface. Has a fluffy looking white head that's initially well over an inch thick when first served. After a few minutes, it settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer surface foam. Good lacing here too. Not a bad look at all. Aromas of some bready malts some herbal and floral notes that I assume are the hop aroma. The taste is pretty much the same, w/ some bready malts followed by floral, maybe some slight hints of corn and or rice, and herbal notes w/ slight hop bitterness. No bad tasting adjunct off-flavors or awful metallic off-flavors here. The flavor, while not great or even that prevalent by any means, seems to suit this beer just fine for what it is. Certainly one of the better tasting beers of this style that I've had. It doesn't even start tasting terrible as it warms up a bit. Has a crisp, yet smooth, light bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink in the way a beer of this style should be. Has a clean finish and decent aftertaste. Not too shabby, but not great to me either. This beer is exactly what it is trying to be. Refreshing on a warm summer night here in Cleveland, OH.

Stroh's,Not the Stroh's of old. I was disappointed in how it had changed. I have been looking for this brand for about a decade and finally found it an hour from home. Once past my disappointment I rated the beer I was drinking. Nothing much different from any of the others in its class. It is a good drinkable beer when you want just a plain beer. There are plenty of others in this category that I don't have to travel to get. I will still buy it when I see it for a change in the fridge. It does have a little uniqueness but not enough to go out of my way for.,3.25
Stroh's,"Stroh's was the first beer I ever tasted back in 1973. Of course, your first ever beer of any brand leaves little to be desired. I tried many beers but I always came back to Stroh's. It had a smooth mellow taste that I could not find with any other beer.
Now, today (7/23/21) I was finally able to find the ""new"" Strohs (been looking for 2 years to find a retailer within a days drive) and I hoped for the best. I'll have to admit, I was hoping for that Stroh's beer of the past to be resurrected but I was disappointed. Then I focused on the Stroh's beer in front of me and I found it to be an extremely well balanced brew. I gave it 4's across the board because it's deserving of that. It's better than 95% of what's out there. Bring back the old tried and true Stroh's and I will give it 5's across the board! In the mean time, I will continue to drink the Stroh's thats in front of me.

Stroh's,I got a cube (30pck) of this beer from my local meijer store . It poured a clear golden with fizzy white head to start which dissipated quickly and left zero lace.. the scent had grain notes.. the taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with typical grain flavor. The mouthfeel was lighter in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a fine beer.....it gets a bad rap....,3.5

Also states the Stroh Brewery Milwaukee, WI, which is just wrong, but I digress. The beer pours bright straw yellow with nearly white head. The head recedes rather slowly for a budget AAL and leaves a fluffy ring and some lacing. The aroma is mild, corny and grainy in nature. The taste is semisweet, corny, with a hint of movie theater popcorn and a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and an undry finish. Overall, good AAL. Could be a lot better with a few more days of lagering to let the yeast finish it's work, but a good value at $18/30 pack.",3.75

Stroh's,"(12 oz can - Stroh's American Lager, JAN0620; purchased cold single at SL... poured into 14 oz mug)

L: brilliantly-clear, yellow-amber liquid; loose, fizzy, foam sponge on pour, crumbles quick... razor thin collar remains, only a couple tiny boogers of lace

S: relatively peppery and toasty on its leading edge, with a note of (corn) syrup lingering in the back... after a minute or two, a bit of spicy, desiccated lemon peel hop pokes out... overall intensity fairly weak

T: again, a bit of bitter hoppiness up front?, with toasty grain and subtle burnt corn notes dominating its dry finish... malt moves forward as it goes... more of a robust grainy punch than a typical AAL - in fact, it really just tastes like a drier, toned-down craft Bo'Pils... spicy, Saaz(?) bitterness lingers awhile, lovely!

F: delicate sizzle, but no bite... bit more body and residual drag than expected, bordering on malt liquor?... cut finish, spicy warmth humming, well-tailored attack

O: I can't recall ever having encountered this before, had to grab one... is this a reinvention or alternate recipe released under the Stroh's name?... wish I would've known - would enjoy regularly having at least a sixer of this on hand (1555)",4.25

Cruzcampo Pilsener,"This beer is mocked throughout Spain, and rightly so. Only tolerable when drunk ice cold on a blistering hot afternoon in Andalusía. As soon as it starts to warm, even a tad, it becomes sweet & sickly. It labels itself as a pilsner. Hmm. A pilsner with no hop character at all. Poor.

Makes a decent base for a shandy though.",2.5
Cruzcampo Pilsener,"surprised this doesnt have better ratings, everyone always seems to take things out of context, or at least thats my assumption on a lot of global lagers like this, i mean against all beer yeah its not a standout, but against euro pale types its solid, and against much of the rest of the spanish lager scene, its quite strong. see its more a pils than a classic pale lager, more grain character without the sweetness, more crisp at the end, some bittering hops in play, and overall a fantastic texture thats dry, uplifting, almost nitro feeling, had this on the glacial draft, apparently colder than average, and it was delightfully clean and refreshing. pretty pour too, an inch of permanent and thick white head on top of radiant golden brassy brew, lovely clarity. some floral character to the hops as it warms, a touch metallic as many of them are here then too, but a fast finish nevertheless. decent body to it, more of a german malt thing too, less cheap tasting than its peers, and frankly a delicious little brew that i could have made an afternoon of. i like how it seemed common to serve small pours of this so that constant cold ones could be brought, makes awesome sense for outdoor daytime drinking. way way way better than its ratings here in my experience...",3.5

Michelob Golden Draft,"Drank from a 12 ounce can. Scores are based on the style.

Look - Would much prefer if the can was full blue or full silver, the gradient isn't doing it for me. That said, the circular seal is nice, and the emphasis on ""Golden"" draws in the eyes. The Minnesota shaped barcode is a neat touch too.

Smell - I can't quite describe the experience of this beer hitting my nose. The smell gets you from a good distance away, but it's the smell of nearly nothing. It's like a diamond plate floor covered in sticky beer residue. Very metallic and mildly sweet.

Taste - Thankfully, the taste is much more interesting than the smell. It's a comforting flavor too. Even though I've never had this beer before, it tastes like tailgating, like being in a trailer at the racetrack, like going to a concert at the county fair. This tastes like public gatherings. Or more realistically, it's a fine balance of malty and earthy. Not too sweet, not too bitter. An exemplary AAL.

Feel - This beer feels perfectly matched to its taste. Medium-thin body with just enough back-of-tongue sparkle to it.

Overall - I definitely prefer this to the light version, but the light version is probably objectively better for a full day of parking lot drinking. However, at home, I'm much more comfortable with the full weight. It's tasty, it's easy, it's relaxing, and I can confidently say that I like it.",3.75

Melbourne Bitter,"Melbourne Bitter is often seen as Victoria Bitters younger cousin, well, at least outside of Victoria that is. In recent years in seems to have been more prominent outside of Victoria, but holds a lesser reputation to the more well known VB. Something that is more widely regarding in regional Victoria, than Melbourne, but holds up as another standard Australian macro lager.

Look: Standard Australian lager. Dark golden lager hue. Clear, filtered. Thin soapy white head that disappears quicker than the sun in Melbourne. Think tiny bubbles floating to the top. Poured out of a 750ml longneck, looks almost flat.

Smell: Honestly not a lot going on. Very faint adjunct grain smell, hint of citrus hop, obviously Pride of Ringwood. There is a metallic ring I'm picking up. Honestly not a lot going on.

Taste: It's mild, and only slightly offensive. Very thin, carbonated. Classic bitter pride of Ringwood hop presence, but metallic flavour holds strong. Decent malt presence gives it a rounded sweetness. Slight graininess but honestly not a great deal going on. Dry-ish finish.

Feel: Thin, heavily carbonated. On a hot summers day, can see the refreshment value in this but not much else.

Overall: It's another mass produced Aussie macro lager. I've had in on tap in Victoria, and I honestly remember it drinking a whole lot better on tap than out of the bottle I'm reviewing it on. VB is probably marginally better than it, but to me it's not completely horrid. It's not great, and I'd probably prefer a European Supermarket beer over it, but it's nothing great. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it unless it's on special, or I'm in Victoria and there's nothing better on tap.",2.25

Melbourne Bitter,"Uncaps with a weedy little sizzle, and pours surprisingly flat and lifeless for an Aussie macro lager—a dull golden colour, with a wispy film of white on the top and very little visible carbonation. Body is quite fine, and what carbonation is there actually looks quite dense.

Nose is what you expect from the genre, with perhaps a little more tilt towards the American macro style, with a strong aroma of cereal adjuncts coming through. Still some metallic twinges to it, and a hint of that muddy, gritty yeast character characteristic of these beers.

Taste is repugnant. Along with the classic CUB yeast dirge, there's a lilting organic character like worm-eaten unripened tomatoes, still containing the pesticides whose job it was to keep the worms off in the first place. Rank and fetid and lingering, leaving a really unsavoury taste in the mouth. Finish is dry and weak, except for that lingering malignancy.

Horrid beer. In some ways, even though it's not as bad all over as some other beers I have, this is worse, because the appearance and the smell don't warn you about how terrible is the thing you're about to put in your mouth.

Well, let this review be your warning instead. Stay away.",1.0
Melbourne Bitter,"Single bottle picked up at a Canberra grocery store.

Poured into a small tumbler. My first clue that I had erred in my purchasing decision was the colour and appearance of this brew, which is all macro lager. Pale golden, loads of visible carbonation, thin soapy head. Doesn't look great. Even though it looks like a lager should, when a beer decidees to call itself a 'Bitter' I can't help but be disappointed when it looks like a lager. Then again, another Carlton product - Victoria Bitter - does the exact same thing. Should have guessed...

Nose is almost non-existent - pale malts, a bit of lemon, chemical. Smells like Bud.

My first sip from the bottle reminded me of those first sips of beer from my dad's nearly empty bottles when I was a kid. Not a good sign. The taste of the poured out stuff was not much better, just a macro lager with a foul, chemical character. Hard to finish. Thin-bodied, harsh carbonation. Yellow fizzy water.

S: good bit of lime aroma dominating its scent, almost smells real; really smells more like Sprite with a lil (corn-fed) beer mixed in... smells alright for what it smells like, a shandy

T: not gonna lie, a relatively delightful flavor at first: lime-infused, lightly-doughy malt base; clean and dry on the outflow, though the finish has the faintest color to it like a mix between a lime sweet-tart candy / lime air freshener... humming aftertaste of lime and cereal, like Trix; dry, doughy

F: very soft suds, pillowy texture and flow, disappearing finish... maybe a delicate touch of residual lime syrup slickness? who knows?... light and easy-drinking, even when drinking at cellar temp

O: tried it just to try it once... it wasn't too too dissimilar to a Mexican beer with actual limes shoved in the bottle (minus real citrus acidity); kind of surprising and thankful it didn't taste more glaringly artificial... maybe this is what light beers need - flavor infusion - so what...

Labatt Blue Light Lime,"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 6/22/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a small fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that linger. Light spotty lacing on the, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, grassy, zesty bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lightly tart lime juice, citrus peel/zest, cracker, corn, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no yeasty notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4%. Overall this is a nice fruited light lager. All around nice robustness and balance of limes, pale malt/grains, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not too watery for the ABV. Great balance between vibrant limes and pils malt/grains; with solid earthy hop presence for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and great style example. Would be great for summer.",4.0
Labatt Blue Light Lime,Not bad. Didn’t find the lime flavor overpowering. Tasted more at the end of each sip than at the beginning. Refreshing beer for a hot summer day. Very watery mouthfeel so it goes right down. Might have it again sometime. Update : I did have it again.Cheers.,5.0
Labatt Blue Light Lime,"Well, it looks like even Canadian brewers are jumping on the fad that is light lagers with lime flavoring. I went into this review knowing full well that this wasn't going to be a high quality beer that I'd be reviewing, but a part of me wanted to know how it would stack up against Bud Light Lime and its ilk. Why? Who knows, but that's just the way my mind works.

Labatt Light Lime pours a yellow/gold color. A fizzy, sudsy head (less than a pinky's worth) forms and thins out in a little under 30 seconds. There was quite a collection of fizzy ""soda"" bubbles on the side of the glass. The aroma was of sweet citrus and lime, with some light grain and vegetable smell. As mentioned, the beer is indeed fizzy, and overall feels pretty thin on the palette. The light citric/lime flavor is the most dominant note here, but the beer is still pretty watery even with that lime presence. There are some grain and vegetable flavors detectable behind the lime, but that's about it. The aftertaste is clean and almost non existant except for some non-descript dryness, and there is no alcoholic warmth at all in this beer.

Indeed, not a high quality beer at all. It is easy to drink, but I would say this is more lime than beer. Save for a summer day thirst quencher when you need something to whet your whistle and nothing more.",2.0
Labatt Blue Light Lime,"This is up there with the absolute worst beers I've ever had.

It pours like you'd expect, clear and gold, with a quickly dissipating head.

This smells so unbelievably artificial, like syrupy and saccharine lime, with corn syrup and skunk.

This honestly tastes terrible. It's revolting, with an overly artificial and unpleasant lime flavor, just out whatever the base light lager tastes like. I get some sweet corn and syrupyness This isn't even all that crisp, which is what the style is supposed to be.

This is just sad. There's no reason at all to drink this.",1.5
Labatt Blue Light Lime,"Labatt Blue Light Lime brewed Labatt Brewing Company Ltd., with an ABV of 4.00% This brew pours out a nice golden, amber color with a smell white head.

I smell lemon-lime soda,basically. This is kind of expected per this style, as I review WITHIN THE STYLE.

Tastes like a less limey Bud Light with Lime. Not to say this is a bad thing per se if its in the high 80's with well over 50% humidity.

I kind of liked that this is a simple EPL. It gave me the ChANce to simply CANduct a quick & simple Crack! & Glug, resulting in the formation of just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with admirable retention in the face of tonight's heat & humidity. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity, bringing The Gelt Gang of Midas, Mammon & Croesus in from the living room, where they were watching tonight's PGH Pirates (Black & GOLD) game on teevee. Nose was malty sweet, but very clean & quite simply, a Lager. I prefer this style over AALs any day of the week at any time. Mouthfeel was medium, big for the style. The taste was quite malty & sweet, more bready than malty, but still a refreshing drink on a hot, humid Summer's night. I have baseball on the telly & this would be a welcome alternative to drinking an AAL at the ballpark. Finish was semi-sweet, just sweet enough for my taste. This was not a bad beer. YMMV.",4.0

Light and incredibly clear, golden straw coloured with a thin, half centimetre head that is bubbly but at least it manages to hold for a little while, barely budging at all over the first few minutes.

Sweet with a lot of corn and grain plus a little bit of alcohol and plenty of skunk coming through. There is a sort of metallic smell initially as well but the beer smells quite cheap on the nose.

Bland tasting at first with a sort of sweet, carbonated water taste and some mild bitterness and some skunky flavours as well. There is some faint grassy hops and a little corn with some cheap lager malts as well.

Grainy & light bodied with a skunky flavour throughout but nothing overpowering at least. There is a clean but very bland mouthfeel and the finish has touches of bitterness and is dry too.

Clear deep yellow brew generates a half inch of bubbly foam that settles quickly to just a spotty layer. Mild aroma of clean semi-sweet pale malt and a tiny bit of soft lemon hop.

Skol Beer,"A - Crystal clear pale yellow with a fizzy 1/2 inch head that fizzles down to nothing within a few seconds. Very little soapy flimsy lace sticks to the glass. Looks like any old American macro pisswasser.

S - Happily, this has a more interesting nose than the appearance would suggest. It's definitely basic, but it's firmly within the parameters of the style, and I would most likely peg it as such in a blind sniff test. Mild caramel sweet notes, with gentle floral hops and a adjunct-y notes that gives the style away.

T - Not too bad! Sweet caramel and vanilla, with mildly floral hops that add just enough bitterness to even out the sweetness. This isn't complex in any way, but it sure is tasty!

M - Light bodied, but far from watery. This is highly carbonated, refreshing, and thirst quenching. The finish is neutral with lingering notes of vanilla bean.

D - This is a damn fine ""sweltering heat"" thirst quencher that beats all of the Mexi-lagers at their own game.

Nose had a pronounced cereal-like graininess, but not much in the way of either hops or unwanted adjuncts. Hmm. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, on the big side for a Lager. The taste was sweet, mildly of perhaps (?) corn, but the fact that it was nearly unidentifiable was a bonus. It was a little too sweet & malty for my taste, but certainly well within specs for this style. I was rather impressed that it came across so well, coming from a green glass (!) bottle. Finish was semi-sweet, bordering on semi-dry. Again. more sweet than I would have liked, but not bad overall.

Consuming as part of the online malt liquor tasting.
The beer pours a bright rich clear golden color with a fizzy bleached white head foaming up about 1 cm. This foam fades to a thin edge layer and one large island in the center of my glass. Several lazy streams of carbonation rise to the surface.
The aroma is fairly mild on this one with a little bit of grain and some general sweetness, with a bit of apple cider note and some corn husk. But very faint all around, may open up as it warms?
First sip reveals a light to medium body with fine and spacious carbonation. Texture is a little thin yet slick and does leave a slight coating feel on my lips.
Flavor is briefly grainy malt and then apple juice, apple cider and refined sugar. The finish is a little bit of white wine or green grape and tarter cider note. no hops no booze. Very easy to drink minus the sweetness and proximal to apple cider character. Finish is lingering now with that white wine note.

Old Monk 10000,"Ratings have some really wild variations on Old Monk 10000. There definitely is packaging incoherence (a Belgian Monk making strong blond lager -- and not an ale yeast -- exported only to the U.S. for those who seek an 8% alcohol kick for not much spent.) There probably also is a QC problem... since it is so seemingly incoherent, it may stay on the shelves and deteriorate. Whatever explains this huge variations in ratings, it is an interesting beer and not half-bad.... if you have it with Indian food ... as I did.

To Look at this beer is not enough to love it (actually the reverse is more true.) Smells are mostly malt and too little intrigue. Tastes are an interesting blend of sweet (malt and fruit/yeast) from beginning to end that is barely balanced by bitter hops. Alcohol is well concealed... I mean, really well concealed.

Shocking stuff & awful tasting throughout, the nose definitely wasn't as bad & came through very slightly better than expected but still wasn't exactly great but the taste was beyond bad. Coming through as a mix of strong alcohol grain & the odd pale malt, the beer was chemical-like in taste with an overpoweringly sickening taste & it meant it was one I struggled to drink even a fraction of before pouring it down the drain; only it's appearance (& to some extent, the nose) saved it from being one of the worst beers I've ever had.",1.0
Bière Du Démon,"Woooah there boy! This tipple is likely to 'tip'ple you over the edge!

Mega strength beer, and excessively so. I actually think it's not too bad, better than some Belgian tripels. A tall slim glass keeps the head, and served chilled takes a bit of the harshness away from it. It has a citrus aspect for me, and given the strength is remarkably smooth to drink. Don't be put off, definitely worth a purchase if available.
A couple of these and you'd be safe sleeping under a bush in the park on a cold night.....thus saving yourself a taxi fare to boot, which can be added to the coffers for sampling a few more brews. Every cloud and all that!

I came back to re-review this one after a second sampling, and down graded it a touch. It is still way way better than the reviews on here, and I think labelling it as a euro strong lager somehow assumes it will be naff right from the get go! But there is the anti-snob in me.",3.75

Amnesia IPA,"Pours copper amber clear with nice frothy foamy cap that quickly fades. Notes of metallic hops and pine. Sharp piney ipa with bitter hoppy after taste.

Not good, could not finish - first time I have EVER dumped most of my beer down the drain.",2.5
Amnesia IPA,"Comes in a mixture of yellow and orange with about a 2/3"" head. Aroma didn't drop hops, instead dropped an almost fusel amount of alcohol.

The taste had bitterness and an exceptional amount of alcohol sting, burn and bite. Its even acidic. Four different kinds of hops? They're lost in this alcohol bomb. The carbonation on these varies wildly, I've had them soft, I've had them soda like.",2.5
Amnesia IPA,"Appearance: Moderately hazy amber body, with a modest, fine-beaded white head, which soon collapses to a dusting of white foam. Modest agitation, say by gently tipping the glass, produces a surge of foam at the glass walls. The lacing is fine, and glass-coating.

Aroma: Dark bread notes and malt dominate the aroma, the hop presence is only slightly notable, and has an herbal quality. In all, the aroma seems quite understated for the style.

Taste: The taste begins with dark, bready malts, as the aroma would suggest. As the taste progresses, there is a moderate herbal hop presence, with a level of restraint that I would expect to find in a pale ale. Later in the taste, there are some citric hops. Finishes with a mild herbal bitterness.

Mouth feel: Soft, but a bit thin, with very mild carbonation.

Drinkability/notes: An lackluster example of the style.

Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice.",1.75
Amnesia IPA,Just no. This did NOT taste like an ipa at all. Off aroma followed by an almost non existent hop profile. It basically tastes like a mediocre homebrew.,1.5
Amnesia IPA,"Dope ass IPA, and gets you buzzin for sure!",3.75
Amnesia IPA,I actually stopped at this brewery on my way home from Mammoth. When you walk in you get more of a factory operation feeling than a beer loving microbrewery feeling. They seem to have more than half of their store dedicated to soda. They did have tastings and their flagship beer aged in oak barrels seemed like a waste of oak barrels. Getting to the beer...I'm not going to say it's the worst beer I've had but it's not far from it. I would not purchase this beer again unless it was around the price of Natty ice. It has a clean taste yet lacks the signature taste you get from certain IPA's. The carbonation is weird too...almost as if they gave it extra carbonation or something from their soda machines. For $7.99+ for a six pack your money will be better spend on something like Sierra Nevada.,2014.0
Amnesia IPA,"Creamy taste like no other IPA Ive tasted. Has no resemblance of an IPA in taste, feel and smell. Not much going on here and rather boring. I still cant believe its an IPA. Think i will skip trying this brew company for now but wish them the best of luck. :-)",1.5
Amnesia IPA,"Isn't an IPA supposed to have some bitter quality from the hops? What I tasted was more sour than anything (perhaps they should just call it a sour beer). Also, not sure why there were proteins floating around in the beer. Shouldn't a professional brewery know how to get that out of the beer? This is he second of four styles I bought from these guys today, and so far they both sucked.",1.5
Amnesia IPA,"I've been reading and consulting BA for a long time, but this is the beer that made me register. It's the worst craft beer I've ever had. In addition to the sub par taste and aroma, the carbonation on it was out of control. First I sipped from the bottle and the gases kind of exploded in my mouth! Then I decided to pour into a glass to let it mellow out for a while. Despite my slow and careful pour, the foam overflowed and I was left with a head that took up most of the glass. I put it in the fridge to try again later - took one more sip and poured the rest down the sink. I live in Singapore now where American craft beer is super expensive (about $7 USD for a 12oz bottle), so I'm glad this was a gift and not something I bought myself.",1.5
Amnesia IPA,"Mother of gawd, I didn't even look at the reviews before I reviewed this brew. But fack, this is just downright awful. this tastes like rotten fruit, and I even received a fresh bottle. This is just very bland, no citrus from ""6"" hops, just blah. I'm sorry, if you crafted this, I commend you, but please try this different. There's nothing from the hops other than bitter, the only thing noticeable is the bitter and the malt. The only good thing I can say from this is I'm feeling light headed. Can't believe I spent $7 on a bottle of this. Do yourself a favor if you're a beer nerd, you probably know the store owner, ask him for an exchange.",1.75
Amnesia IPA,"Poured straight from bottle to a chilled glass.

Appearance - To me it looks like your typical IPA, dark amber color with a touch of light brown. After pouring there wasn't much head, about a fingers worth. Quickly dissipates to a thin and hardly noticeable head. Noticeable lacing around the glass.

Smell - For some reason, I immediately thought of pizza dough when I took a sniff of this beer. Some caramel hints but not much hop presence that I can smell.

Taste - After reading some of the reviews on this one, I really didn't think this beer was going to taste good. I have to disagree here. The first thing I notice as I take a drink is the piney hop flavor that really presents itself without being too bitter. The hops tie in nicely to the malt and caramel flavors in this beer, but I will say that for an IPA it isn't as bitter as I would like. It does taste good, but it doesn't scream IPA.

Mouth - Feels light bodied with medium carbonation. Goes down decently smooth but the carbonation lightly tickles the back of the throat. It is a little watery.

Overall - It seems that this is either a love it or hate it beer. I have to say that it isn't amazing but it is quite drinkable. My main gripe with it is that it really doesn't seem like a true IPA. The hops just aren't there like they should be. The other flavors that come through kind of make up for this, though. If you're expecting a true, bitter IPA then you will be disappointed. I wouldn't pick up a six pack but I may be tempted to pick up a single bottle later on down the road.",3.0
Amnesia IPA,"Pours a clear amber color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are decent. Has a malty, piney aroma. Actually not bad. The taste is where it goes south. Malty taste, but the bitter hop is taste a little more like something went bad. Almost like wet leaves. Somewhat astringent aftertaste. There is some caramel at the end. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. I don't think the beer is as bad as some reviews have said. I had this beer a couple years ago and did give it a much lower rating, but I am presently surprised compared to the last time.",3.25

Seems like the brewers these days are just making the same old trash in different bottles with new labels and fancy names. Its not super dry at all so I have no idea what that indicates. I didn't have high expectations and rightly so.

Another bland and uninspiring offering from Australia's ""big boys"" brewers.

Better than some other main stream beers... just.",3.0
Hahn Super Dry,"Pours a deep yellow colour, with just a filmy head of coarse bubbles. No lacing, and extremely filmy. It's a very, very uninspiring looking beer. I'm not enjoying the prospect of taking a sip.

Bit of banana phenols on the nose, but mostly bland. Indeed, it has quite a sweetness on the nose - I was expecting something crisp and dry -- perhaps there's a bit of grass or spice, but it mixes up with the sweetness into something terrible.

Bland, bland, bland on the palate. Clear again, but once again with that sweetness. Overall, it's hard to say anything more than watery, however. Carbonation is a bit too fizzy, leaving it bloating. It's really nothing, but it's not even dry, for a beer which claims as much.

Really quite terrible. It's so bland, but whatever characters it has are pretty awful. It doesn't even deliver what it promises. And I wasn't overly enamoured of that prospect anyway.",2.5
Hahn Super Dry,"I'm going to be frank. I went into this thinking that I would hate it but found it to actually be a palatable drink. Nonetheless, as an essentially flavourless beer it won't be getting high marks.

It pours a light golden colour with a tiny head. Poor head retention.

The aroma isn't bad for the style with a faint malty note and a light spicy hop aroma.

The flavour is fairly empty, as one would expect from the style but I actually pick up a touch of malt and don't find it too bad. If this was the BJCP this beer would be doing okay.

The mouthfeel is very light (in fact the FG is 0.999) with high carbonation. I don't particularly like it but it is suitable for style.

As a lawnmover beer this is very good and I could drink this. Nonetheless, I wouldn't pay for one.",3.5
Hahn Super Dry,"Pours pale gold with a large head that quickly fades into a scum-like layer.
Nose shows loads of sweet vegetal and rice notes, with some faint spicy hops in the background, followed later by some clean malt.

Carbonation is too high.",1.5
Hahn Super Dry,"Appearance - Usual Oz macro colour with excessive carbonation. 1 finger of very bubbly head which reduced.

Smell - Surprisingly, some of the malty odours I expect in a lager are present, but they are so mild this only deserves a 2 in this category.

Taste - What taste? Like most low carb beers, even most of the pleasant grainy lager flavours have been stripped away in this, leaving only a dry metallic flavour.

Mouthfeel - Like mineral water, but also cloying.

Drinkability - Despite all it's faults, I tend to choose this over Australian brewed Heineken and other similar lagers as a session drink. Not sure why, though.

Overall - Even worse than Pure Blonde. Bleurgh.",3.0
San Miguel Especial,"SanMiguel Especial, which come in a standard 330ml bottle with a medium ABV of 5,4%. Not to be mistaken with another beer named like that from the Philippines.

Poured into the Guinness it left a two inches white head quickly vanishing as I write this. Clear and golden yellow brew.

On the nose, it’s pretty dull some hints of floral notes and that’s about it.

On the palate, it’s again not opening a Pandora’s box of aromas of flavors, but that was expected for something I was fearing would be another mediocre industrial Euro Lager. It’s a bit richer than that. I like the dry finish and drinkability but I wasn’t looking for more from this one.

It’s a medium bodied beer with high carbonation. Dry finish and drinks well

Overall it’s not as awful as reviewed here or elsewhere. Best drink fresh and cold, would probably pair really well with España food but in lack of a Chorizo or Paella right now, not to mention being quite far from the Puerta del Sol, this will be a one and done.

Spanish draft San Miguel I actually like and would give a good rating to. This however is very lifeless and not so great...

Anyway, aroma is very malty. Flavour is quite flat, but improves as it warms up slightly. Not much of an aftertaste and quite dry, very overtly pasteurized I would suggest.

Not a fan, it's a shame as the stuff in Spain is pretty good. Now sure about the Singapore version...

Has an odd adjuncty sweetness to it, bending it towards syrupy. Definitely artificial in terms of flavour. Cheap malt syrup, metallic off-flavour, pils/pale malts. No noticeable hop character.

Overcarbonated. Smooth, wet, unrefreshing, medium-bodied (where it ought to be light-bodied).

Drinkable as a budget brew when it's cold. Most Vietnamese canned beers seem to blend together with few distinctive characteristics, but this is recognizably a notch below the norm.

High D+ (2.50) / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
July 11th, 2016: 2nd can purchased in Hoi An. Sabeco owns Bia Saigon, apparently.

The abnormally slender hole left by the pull-tab once opened allows less beer through than most cans, which is something of a Godsend seeing how ghastly this is.

Sweet malt syrup, adjunct (corn, rice, who cares?), stale barley. Too sweet, too simple, and certainly shallow. There's no intricacy or depth of flavour here at all, and nothing really to come for save for the 5.30% ABV (which I'll grant is above average for regional lagers, and isn't badly disguised).

Not a beer I intend to revisit unless economy demands it, even at its reasonable-by-Western-standards price. Drinkable enough, to be fair. We've all had worse, but it's still pretty poor fare.

S: Very faint. Some bready malt deep inside. Clean grassy character with light lemon on top. Good pils-ish character.

T: Beery with lots of sweet lemony zest in there. Grass and some sort of light crackery malt. Very refreshing.

F: Light body to match light character.

Overall, I could see drinking a lot of this in steamy Vietnam, or even in the oven that is Shanghai's summer. A good pale-like beer with lots of refreshing character for this corner of the world.",3.75

Amstel Lager,"This is a 25cL bottle of Amstel's ""AMSTEL BIER"", labeled PIlsener, as packaged for the Dutch Caribbean market, and dated Mrt-19. Served in a tapered tumbler the beer is pale yellow, clear, and forms nearly no head. Aroma has a bit of biscuit malt and skunk. Flavor is mild, with a neutral level of carbonation for the style and very little flavor to bite on the palate. Mostly, but not entirely, inoffensive. And when served absolutely ice cold, it's positively enjoyable after a few hours of snorkeling under the tropical sun. But, this is beeradvocate, not refreshmentadvocate, and as a beer, this just isn't very tasty.",2.5
Amstel Lager,"A 440ml can with a BB of Aug 2018. Brewed in the UK under contract; ABV is stated as 4.1%. Purchased a while back from Morrisons. The label states that this is brewed according to the Amstel tradition.

A: Poured into a straight pint glass. A crystal-clear golden colour with light carbonation and some vague floating sediment. Forms a decent head of creamy white foam that lasts for a moment or two before collapsing and dissipating.

S: Aroma of faint pale malt with whispers of earthiness and stewed leaves. Almost non-existent. Not flawed but not really beer either....

T: Tastes of very light malt with faint notes of grain, stewed leaves/veg and a twinge of earthiness. Very dry, with little bitterness to speak of. Underwhelming would be an understatement.

M: Mouthfeel is smooth, tingly and dry, with prickly carbonation and thin body for the style. Mildly astringent. Aftertaste of harsh stewed leaves and faint malt.

O: A subpar industrial lager. Unimpressive on all fronts. Average looks and body, while the aroma and flavour are bland yet punctuated by subtle off-notes. Barely worth the effort of drinking - give it a miss.",2.75

L: polished-clear, brassy-gold liquid, some flecks of sediment; tall, tight, silken foam stand... the foam holds at first, then breaks up after the first sip; leaves a solid ring of lace at the top while keeping a collar till the end

S: mineral, herbal-grassy hop?; hint of peppery phenol?, rather fresh-baked bready underlying foundation... great expression and intensity overall

T: pretzels and lemon peel; dry finish with a moderate, peppery-herbal bitterness which lingers long... aftertaste is quite dry, with a toasty pretzel bready essence quietly humming

F: cut dry, tight flow; seems like there's a dextrin plumpness to its body up front, but it just drops in the finish

Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,"Without going into specifics, I found myself in a situation where the option of ordering a low alcohol beer presented itself. My first ever!
Poured a clear watery color with a piss yellow color background. Little to no head and instantaneously dissipates into nothing.
There was a grainy aroma that was ok, however, there was also an offputting hint of aged cheese, stale tea and sweaty socks. To its credit, this negative aroma did somewhat phase itself out.
The taste was mostly malt forward with a clean lager feel. Not bad, however, there was a bit of astringency to the flavor which didn’t seem to come from hops.
The body is light, watery and fizzy. A bit overcarbonated and a bit rough around the edges in terms of mouthfeel.

Pale brass lemon yellow with very good clarity. Very bright bleach white head, managing a good two fingers off the pou, but settles to a simple fine puck and collar. Looks like a better than average industrial beer.

Aroma is quite a bit off putting. Burnt flour like grains predominate the nose. Chalky and powdery burnt residue just get quite a bit of scent on the nose here. Moderate sensing malt sweetness, but hardly much to be contained here.

Surprisingly not as bad as I thought it would be on the palate, but still not providing an enjoyable experience. Chalky burnt grains on the palate, with an exceptionally watery mouthfeel. Tap water like body and consistency. A faint touch of a bit of malt sweetness manages to save it just a little. Very odd bitterness that doesn't even feel like hops.

Very strange NA brew, much better out there.",2.0

Taste was a different hopped AAL kind of beer. I dunno. Maybe you're on probation and you've been Eiffel Towered by the whole town and fire department like Chrystal has, so you're relegated to drinking this to drown your sorrows. Like Trump says, its sad, its really sad.",1.75
Buckler Non-Alcoholic Brew,"There was a point, a few years back, when I was on a style kick, drinking widely of one style until I either exhausted the available commercial stock or my palate became exhausted. N.A. or Low-Alcohol Beers were one such instance & I was recently surprised to realize that I have not previously reviewed this one. Time to make up for lost time!

From the bottle: ""Premium Quality"".

As usual, nothing happened until I Pop!ped the cap. After that, the brew seemed to fly into my glass, following a heavy-handed pour. This created a brief finger of foamy, bone-white head that withered in the face of the day's heat & humidity. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity. I was surprised when The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Croesus & Midas suddenly appeared as I would have thought this to be beneath their mighty gaze. Nope, they just love gold! Nose had a pleasant sugary maltiness to it, leading me to wonder whether it began as a lager or an ale. My bet is on the former. The taste was also decent, with a lager-like sweetness and a touch of Noble hop bitterness. Finish was dry and actually kind of refreshing. For me, it was kind of a novelty treat, but when I first got on an N.A. kick years ago, I had a buddy who could only drink them due to his far out meds. I don't know if he had this one, but I do know that he liked some more than others. This was decent.",3.5

Getting back I notice it's from Wisconsin, so my expectations are raised slightly. Those 'sconnies know their beer. I didn't pour it into a glass because I'm not a heathen. Was expecting to have to chase swigs of it with bites of leftover pizza, but the taste actually isn't that bad. It's overly sweet and corny, but I was expecting that.

The flavor is pretty shitty. On the front end it isn't bad, mild grain and hops but on the back end it is adjuncty and sickly sweet.

S - Grape juice, fructose, caramel, grain, light fusel alcohol when it warms up but not too bad for the style.

T - Sugar, corn, white grape juice, cereal grains. Alcohol is surprisingly well-hidden, although this verges on cloying sweet after a few ounces.

M - Lower carbonation, medium-bodied, some grain to the texture, and moderate alcohol warmth in the finish.

D - This is actually pretty solid, and one of the better takes on the style that I've had. This one is a little bit too sweet for me to tackle the whole 40oz bottle. Not quite as good as Stack, as this one is lower in alcohol but doesn't taste any better.",3.0

Taste: Starts off sweet, with tastes of substandard grains and sugar-dosed corn meal. Hint of fruitiness somewhat reminiscent of apples. As with so many (okay, almost all) of these malt liquors, it has that troubling, potentially-flammable chemical taste to it. Finishes near-hot, sweet, and chemical coated.

Look - Very busy but kind of charming. It has a sort of simple 90s aesthetic to it. It's not the most beer-looking, but I like it.

Smell - Sweet and malty, very powerful smell for an adjunct lager. Smells more like a German dunkel almost. A good smell but on the verge of overpowering.

Taste - The taste more or less follows the smell. Very sweet, very bready, somewhat of a caramel taste. Could use with some more bitterness to tone it down, but it's got a character that I've never experienced in this style.

Feel - A weird creamy/soapy texture. Not entirely pleasant. Could definitely use with a bit more carbonation.

HOLY SWEETNESS BATMAN. It's like someone dumped sugar in my beer. The banana runt flavor is there, which I like, but then it turns cloyingly bad with lumps of sugar and malt mix. A pine stab very faintly finishes out the profile, but it barely pushes through the overwhelming sweetness in this beer. Notes of banana linger through the end.

Creamy yet still carbonated, but nothing exceptional. A little sticky in a bad way. Ends wet.

While they were on the floor, rolling around, coughing and gagging, I leaned in for a sniff. Minhas strikes again!

I was getting notes of stale tobacco to go along with all of the other off flavors and I began to curse NickD717 for starting me on this CAN Kick. Just then, the fence collapsed out back and the Cybermen began their advance on my house. Another long draught and when I looked down, my hands were encased in metallic gloves, just as my feet were in heavy metal boots. It had begun again! At one point, I had CANsumed enough Minhas products to develop a tolerance and an immunity to this sort of thing, but I have been CANfining myself to better beers of late, eschewing AALs and this was the result. Decent lacing began to form in my glass and it occurred to me that I might need to jackhammer it loose later, if I survived. Fortunately, all of my past encounters with the Cybermen had brought me to the attention of both Doctor Who and Torchwood and they had left a model of K-9 with me for future such encounters. K-9 appeared from his dormancy in my living room and began to repel the Cybermen as I choked, gagged and chugged down what was in my glass. Remember, no drain pours on The CANQuest (TM), if it is to count. The finish was raw, semi-dry, but in an unfinished way. It was as though it had not entirely fermented or the process had gone horribly, horribly wrong. Just as I finished it off, the Cybermen went into retreat and I got my insurance agent on the phone to get yet another new fence. I may start sending the bills for replacement fences to Monroe, Wisconsin ...",2.0
Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some notes of plastics, not a good sign. Taste is, well, yep, taste is of a Minhas beer. Crisp, some green apples, malts, a bit of plastic, a typical flavor profile from this brewery. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while not as bad as some of there beers, is nothing special.",2.75
Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,"I don't know who these dudes are, but anyone who would even attempt to get serious about critiqueing a typical american pilsner that is mass produced is missing the boat. Call them craft beers if you wish, but that would be like calling Bud Lite, or Miller Draft, or Coors craft beers. If all beers were bitter that would get a little boring don't you think? And I certainly would not be bold enough to suggest how breweries should change their beers to suit my personal tastes. If they were foolish enough to do so we would have how many varieties of beer on the planet earth? Let me answer that question for you. The answer I believe is obviously...one.
I happen to like beers that are malty. It's my favorite characteristic in a beer. I also like sweetness in a beer. Mountaincrest not only has a deeper color than most typical american lagers, it also has a stronger, bolder flavor which makes it most desirable. Foaming characteristics? Who cares? Most beer drinkers don't drink the foam and actually wait for it to dissipate. Nose? You've GOT to be kidding! When is the last time you worried about the smell of a Miller Lite? I not only like the taste of MountainCrest, I think it is one of the better tasting beers in the store. College kids should be going nuts over this stuff. And the price is definitely a plus for beer drinkers that like quantity.
I heard that MountainCrest and Boxer are actually the same beer. Not as far as I could tell. The boxer looked paler in color and weaker in taste. Although I must admit I did not try them side by side. I'm sure it won't be too difficult to find out. Still, $12.99 for 36 cans translates into 36 cents a can. If there is anyone out there that is beating that price let us know!",4.0
Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,"This poured out as a pale looking yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The head settles into nothingness and leaves no head retention or lacing. The smell of the beer is loaded with malt sweetness much like most of the Minhas brews. The taste of the beer is mostly all malt, no bitterness at all, it's very one dimensional. The mouthfeel is light bodied, carbonated and watery, very boring. Overall this beer needs a lot more of a bitterness to it. It's far too sweet and really needs some bitterness to balance it out.",2.0
Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,"Mountain Crest (Mountain Creek or Minhas Creek) has a medium, quickly dissipating head, some splotchy lacing, and a clear, bubbly golden appearance. The aroma is of sickly-sweet green apples and musty grain. The flavor is of sweet, Jolly Rancher apple-flavored candy, tartness, grain, and a dash of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Mountain Crest finishes harsh, ragged, and unpleasant (to an extent). Overall, this is, at best, an average beer, but it does has some character, even it it's a bad character. Try it, but you'll probably not like it.

Mountain Crest Classic Lager Beer,"Reviewed from notes.

A. Transparent pee-yellow with a short lived foam collar, no real lacing at all to speak of.

S. Smells like apple/pear juice mixed with simple syrup sweetener from a bar dispenser.

T. Rotting potatoes, sugary sweetness combined with acidic vomitous bile, with a very long extended rusty metal finish. Wow. If it were possible to rate a zero out of five I would without hesitation. Seriously, a very pervasive rotten potatoes flavor either speaks for an infected can or a very terrible beer.

M. Light, thin and watery, but not quite carbonated enough to clear the metallic / acid haze from my mouth.

Oh dear lord, this one was really quite terrible. I recommend staying the hell away from this ""beer"". Even if I had happened to get some kind of infected can, I am not willing to subject myself to the contents of another on the off-chance that it might be better, that was how bad it was. It is just not worth the risk.",1.5
Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,"Reviewed from notes. This is one of the worst beers I have ever had. It has no resemblance to a traditional lambic and can't be construed as ""stretching"" the style boundaries.

Looks are decent enough - a slightly reddish, golden color. Lively carbonation to the eye.

The aroma is a muddle of wheat bread, vague fruit notes, medicinal, a little yeasty. It is not fresh or inviting in the smell.

The taste falls far short of expectation. The base beer seemed off somehow, and the cranberry flavor seems artificial and medicinal. Some sweetness, some tart from the cranberry, but it is pretty much a muddle of indistinguishable and unremarkable flavors.

The feel - this looked pleasantly carbonated, but it is quite bloating and very harsh on the tongue. Some of the sting is cranberry, but it seems to be carbonated with very small bubbles that become uncomfortable.

Overall, this is a poor representation of a lambic and is generally a poorly constructed beer against what sounds like a good concept - good idea, bad execution?",2.0
Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,"Quite the abomination to what could be considered a lambic. Right up there with some super failed homebrew attempts at lambic.

Did you want a cranberry vodka? Because thats you get when you order a cranberry lambic. The aroma is wheat-esque.

Taste is nothing like a lambic. This is a bad beer by any standard, but damn if you didn't call it a lambic. They just dumped a bunch of cranberry juice into a wheat beer. Homebrew surprise all over this one. good for nothing. Acidic, I'd rather drink juice.",1.75
Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,"This is the worst ""beer"" I've ever had in my life. I first had it when I was a depraved college kid who would play Edward 40 hands wth OE and still could not finish a bottle of this garbage. For years I thought all ""lambics"" were terrible because this garbage that I got in a Sam Adams sampler pack. I've since grown and learned the virtues of true sour beers and even more so want this to f--- off. It's not a lambic, it's a crap wheat beer with horrid cranberry flavoring and maple syrup that do not go at all and are not even a fraction as good as it sounds, in fact it's awful. The fact that this beer continues to exist would make aliens, if they existed, not want to land here because the world does not make sense and is too scary because this garbage swill continues to be sold to the masses rather than used to torture prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. You prevent the growth of America's youth by selling this garbage as ""craft"" beer, thereby ensuring a country of Bud drinking drones. If I could punch this beer in the face i would. I poured this down the drain to drink a bottle of Mohawk vodka instead because it was a better alternative. Burn in Hell, you POS ""beer"".

Aroma is of moldy broccoli, stewed beets, and mango puree.

The initial/base flavor is really awful, like used chewing tobacco, but it's entirely grainy. Then a nice mango flavor comes in - whether it's artificial or real, I guess it doesn't matter, because it takes over the nasty flavor so it's a welcome arrival. The finish is of mango/grapefruit lozenge. A general rotten flavor sustains throughout the profile.

Feel is nonexistent. Just very thin, empty. Clean though. Nice carbonation. Light chalkiness.

12 fl. oz. clear glass bottle. Ink Jet packaging information is worn and illegible.

The label for Pittsburgh Brewing Co.'s I.C. Light mango is basically the recipe: it's I.C. Light with ""NATURAL FLAVORS AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS"" added. That sound a little bit harsh, but it actually gives it pleasant, and surprisingly realistic mango flavor. The only surprise is that it's also lightly skunked ~ and I'm assuming it's only lightly skunked because there aren't that many hops in there to begin with. Still, it doesn't come across as ""sweet"", even with the additional sweeteners. It's an interesting and enjoyable light beer that would be perfect for summer, and at just 3.8% ABV you could drink a few if you wanted to. A very good entry into the fruited light beer category.",3.25

Schaefer,"Best by 7/22/19

Pours a golden straw topped with an ample thick white foam; slowly receding retention leaves layers of splotchy lacing and a fading cap and collar.

Aromas show muddled grainy notes and some fresh straw with a minor corn sweetness almost overshadowed entirely by an oncoming presence of grassy hops; bouquet has a quiet pop to it.

Taste lots of grain and a light honeyed sweetness throughout the profile, while grassy hops come in late to give a rounded quality; finishes quickly with hints of a somewhat unpleasant metallic tone lingering.

Mouthfeel holds a light body that holds nicely until the back end, where it becomes a bit watery; smooth carbonation with a progressive prickle on the palate and a decent crispness overall; finish thins and fades quickly.

Solid, essentially inoffensive AAL with a developing grain character and reinforcing hoppy prickle; somewhat inconsistent overall to be a go-to, but I'd have no problem returning to this one if the situation called for it.",2.75

Broad, grainy flavor with a touch of noble hops, but not much. Heavy texture, but not too carbonated. This is basic, blue collar beer, the kind of which working people have quaffed in this country and the old world for hundreds of years. It is also macro produced, corporate nonsense. Glad I tried a local legend but at eighty cents a twelver more than Natty Boh and almost a buck and a half more than PBR, probably not going to be gracing my fridge again anytime soon.",2.5

Schaefer,"How many beers currently on the market have as much history as Schaefer? Unfortunately, that rich history led to it being brewed by Pabst, ripping it from the Brooklyn beer scene. Still, some brands acquired by Pabst (e.g. Ballantine) remain impressive (at least for their price), so I'm optimistic going in.

A 12 pack cost me $10.49 plus tax and deposit at a beer distributor in NYC. The box is pretty nondescript, relying on its now diluted brand instead of playing up the retro vibe. Still, there's an old-timey straightforwardness to the (lack of) marketing that endears me to it, evoking a sort of ""your grandfather's brand"" vibe.

The can is just as nondescript, its only graphic design flourish the placement of the beer's name inside a red oval. ""America's oldest lager beer"" (I guess Yuengling's lawyers are looking the other way on this one). ""Established in the United States 1842."" 12 fl oz format. Standard pull-tab.

APPEARANCE: Clean depleted copper body. Off-white fizzy head. Retention is poor given the ABV - maybe 1 minute.

Dull and sad in appearance, lacking any vibrance or life. But it's filtered and yeast-free.

AROMA: Corn adjunct. Pils malts. 2-row barley. A hint of syrupy sweetness.

Corn dominates. Some grassy hop aromatics or some graininess would be nice; this bends a bit too sweet, suggesting an imbalanced brew. Still, the aroma suggests it has more body than your standard thin watery adjunct lager, so I guess....I'm hopeful?

Aromatic intensity is low. No off-notes are detectable, nor is any overt booze.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Syrupy sweet throughout, though it does hit on a blip of graininess right on the finish that's a little more dry. Elsewise, it's medium-bodied, syrupy, overly thick and lumpy for an adjunct lager, and unrefreshing. Smooth and wet until the finish. Overcarbonated, though not as egregiously so as many adjunct lagers.

It's inoffensive in terms of taste, but that requires you to get past the syrupy sticky mouthfeel (which is a tall order). Not grainy enough, with sweet corn adjunct leading the pack (and the rest of the dogs in that pack are all tired sick hounds: stale 2-row, generic pale malt). Water is minerally and seems a bit hard for an adjunct lager.

No real hop flavours whatsoever; I search for the usual blip of grassy hop flavour but it's absent.

I'll take a watery thin body over a syrupy sticky one like this 9 times out of 10. To say this is simple and shallow is an understatement; it's one of the most neutral beers on the market...and therein may lie (or have lay) its appeal. It's drinkable and dull, not demanding one's attention. I guess it wouldn't distract from food, and might pair well with spicy Mexican food that would blast your palate with chili heat anyway.

OVERALL: Giving credit where it's due, there are no off-flavours here; it's not metallic, I find no DMS/diacetyl/brettanomyces/acetaldehyde, and the alcohol isn't overt. In that sense, ""inoffensive"" may be the biggest compliment I can give it. But inasmuch as budget macrolagers go, I'd opine most drinkers are better off going with Rolling Rock, Miller High Life, or the like (assuming one wouldn't cross into budget ale territory with Ballantine, Gennesee, or the like). I'm impressed Pabst can brew this consistently on the scale they do, but it's far from amongst the best beers in the style.

I tip my hat to the brand's history, but this won't attract casual drinkers or discerning drinkers, and is best left on shelves to let the brand continue dying its slow death.

Lingering and repulsive acidic taste, flat and empty body even for a light beer. Aroma not completely repugnant but it's nothing that a beer should smell like as it is absent of any trace of fundamental beer ingredients. Smells more like sake without the alcohol. If you like beer made from rice I guess this won't be the worst thing you could drink but don't expect quality here.",1.5

S - Average for the style. Lightly astringent but much better than adjunct beers.

O - This is an ok beer if you're in the mood for something bland and thick. You can pick up a 6pack around these parts for less than $8. I needed some extra bottles for a batch I'm brewing and this was about this same price as buying bottles.",2.75

Kalik,"This OK lager does its job. A beverage suitable for tropical weather. Washes down average food. Crisp.
But, it has crummy-to-poor ratings. Why ?
Could it be because Heineken owns Commonwealth Brewery ? Or is it that raters want flavor and alcohol for under $2 ?
So, I try to figure out the ""Why"" of the low ratings and go on Heineken's website. And I was surprised to see how much they are updating their image. (Last time I looked on their site, it was several years ago when they funded the huge Lagunitas factory and brewpub in Chicago's ghetto.)
Amazingly, Heineken is following many themes of local crafters: sustainability, local sourcing, giving back to the community, reducing CO2, and lots of other good stuff. What can be bad if a big company is actually trying to do good ?

Camo Black Extra,"(24 fl. oz can, purchased cold... poured into a Goose Island chalice)

L: crystal-clear, brassy gold colored liquid; foam loudly sizzles away upon pour... looks like sparkling apple cider; no lace, no collar

S: initial aromatic pop includes sweetness/essence of pale malt leaping forward, backed quickly by what can only be described as spiced powdered donut or those Pfeffernüsse cookies... standard malt liquor smells, with only a mild extra kick of ethanol which, as it sits, later develops into an almost watery blended-Scotch and/or spiked used fryer oil scent... the raw booze does eventually take a lil precedence, but the malty wash in each sip snuffs out that sensation

T: malt flavor almost has a lightly-buttery, shortbread/sugar-cookie quality - - that hits first, but a torrent of spicy, sweetish booze charges past, leaving a light peppery note up front in the palate, while the now vaguely syrupy malt bounces back to the middle of the palate behind the wake of fire... not terribly sweet, either balanced enough by the strident booze and/or the carefully-crafted degree of grassy/herbal 'imported' hops added... the more one gets into it, the more it tastes like a malt-loaded, low-abv apple brandy

F: not too carbonated, not all that viscous, not much bite from the alcohol - rather dull on the palate, but it also doesn't quite feel like it's around 12%... I'd say champagne is more taxing to the senses... gotta get warmed up, but this is a walk in the park

O: really not all that bad considering, well, everything about it... my brother and I, during the initial stages of a day-long beer tasting hang-out, shared a half a can last week and we both agreed, while it wasn't terrible, it could be difficult (without training) to get through a whole 24 oz solo... best to drink this from the can and relatively cold... would not be opposed to buying this again if the situation, feeling, and company called for it - could pair well with some battered whiting and a sweet potato pie; a little greasy mound of collards and a knuckle of corn bread would pull it all together rather splendidly",3.5

Camo Black Extra,"Alright so this isn’t going to be the typical beer review like me telling you the audience about the color, smell, and the amount of head. Instead I’m going to review this beer in the practical since because it’s a can of malt liquor.
The sound of the can cracking open is getting me excited. It sounds like someone taking a big bite out of an apple. I’m not going to bother smelling it because it’s MALT LIQUOR and it is meant to be slammed. So here we go. I chugged ¼ of the can before my gag reflex decided to come to work. Taste sweet as hell and also taste like Dynatabe mixed with whiskey. No hiding the alcohol taste in this shit. This shit is revolting, putrid. Alright got ½ the can before the gag reflex kicked in again and gave me the shivers with goose bumps, the taste took my breath away. The label should say CAMO BLACK EXTRA the malt liquor that fights back. They should have a guarantee of your money back if you can finish the can, I doubt very few can. Alright at this point with ½ of the can left it’s a battle of who is going to win me or the CAMO BLACK. I’ll tell you this I ain’t never poured out a beer before but with ½ of the can left staring me down, my body gets pissed off at me right now and wants me to give in. This shit kicked my ass. I killed the can but it took me 30min to do it in, I must be getting old. I sit and do the math, I realized I drank a 6 pack in the form of one can.
Alright overall the beer is good as a novelty at best. If you’re looking to get drunk then CAMO BLACK EXTRA is a guarantee. If you can suffer through the pain, this beer delivers one hell of a buzz, shit one more and I might be in black out mode. If 2 of these cans don’t get you f****d up than you need Jesus.",2014.0

Camo Black Extra,"Seeing as how Camo Black Ice was just about the shittiest malt liquor to pass these lips, it was only fitting to try the ""Extra"" version to *truly* plumb the depths of the worst beers on the planet. For science. Here's to bad decisions...

Bright saturated orange color, rapid champagne carbonation, thin layer of white foam on the surface that does lace slightly. Audibly fizzy foam crackles like rice krispies.

Smells like artificial grape flavoring, energy drink, and Flintstones vitamins.

Tastes godawful. Very harshly astringent, vague paper and grape juice flavors, descending into utter malaise and ennui. Way overcarbonated and fizzy, rapidly fades into a numbing boozy aftertaste.

Even drinking this as cold as possible doesn't help mask the terrible taste. If you are just looking to get drunk, whiskey is a far better option.

Camo Black Extra,"CAN you dig an early start to the day? We debated this one on a snow day earlier in the year and the CANsensus is - Start when you're ready. I awoke early for some unknown reason following a night with a 2.5 L plastic bottle of Arsenaloye Strong beer and that should make a nice segue into this gem.

From the CAN: ""Special Reserve""; ""Imported Hops & Extra Malted Barley for an Extra Smooth Taste (& Flavor)""; ""Ultra Premium High Gravity Lager Beer""; ""Naturally Brewed Longer with the Highest Quality Extra Malted Barley"".

My initial reaction - Rubbish! The term ""Ultra"" CANjures up MKUltra, the ultra-secret use of LSD on unsuspecting Army GIs and ""Extra"" reminds me of my time in the PI. ""Mama-San, Suzie-Girl tells me there is an extra trick that she knows how to do."" ""Yes, but Extra is extra!""

The Crack & Glug produced two finger's of fizzy, bone-white head that disappeared like it could not wait to get away from whatever had produced it. In fact, it may have set a new record in terms of dissipation time. They may have ""naturally brewed"" this CANcoction, but it smelled as natural as plastic. The odor wafting off of it was of Concord grapes - vinous, but not in a good way and sweet as all get-out. My liver began its internal dance, hoping for the best against all odds. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was sizzling hot! OMFG, this was the equivalent of putting your tongue on the grill at the local Japanese steakhouse. Ssssszzzzlle. As the tears ran down my cheeks, a result of my weeping for those who are reduced to drinking this on a routine basis and for mine own dying liver, I girded myself for another sip. The initial heat behind me and my taste buds seared into submission, it reminded me of MD 20/20! No s**t! It was grapey as hell with a fusel alcohol burn known only to the most hardcore of us. I had a buddy in SoCal for whom that was his drink of choice and I sampled it in its various forms many times until I realized that even I could not hang. Wow, MD 20/20 as a beer!?! Who'da think it? Finish was bone-dry. It might have come off as sweet on the tongue, but from the back of my throat could be heard the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara. It was not unpleasant, actually. It might be attributable to the idea that my Brain Housing Group, not to be CANfused with the Trigger Housing Group, blew off in the first couple of sips, but I was starting to feel mighty mellow, dig? I was now beginning to search for the nearest brown paper bag so that I could join my neighbors in the alley. They are actually a good time, f'real, f'real. In the summer, I will jack up a bomber of some Rogue beer and hang wit' 'em but it's too chilly today.

Appearance - weak pale golden straw color. Decent finger of head was poured but doesn't last long. Some visible bubbles and the tiniest string of lacing left behind. Looks like a macro.

Mouthfeel - it's wet and has a little less than average carbonation. Feels like a macro.

Overall - there's not too much good to say about this other than that it rates on par with macros, and as far as English pale ales go, it's pretty bad.

Maclay's Traditional Pale Ale,"Tallboy can from the LCBO. Had it before, but not in a few years.

Pours a familiar golden-straw colour, with slightly more than a finger of pearl-white, fizzy head that is mostly gone within a few minutes. It's pale alright, but looks more like a lager to me. The aroma is grainy, with definite adjunct tones and some grassy hops.

Other than the fact that it is very mild, it has very little in common with legitimate EPAs. Grainy malts, with some corny/rice sweetness. Light apple juice fruitiness. Some weak, grassy hop notes toward the end. Clean finish without much aftertaste. Very watery and light-bodied, standard macro levels of carbonation but plenty drinkable.

When I was attending university (in Guelph, where Sleeman brands are popular - perhaps with logical reason because they always seem fresher there), I lived in a house with three friends and each of us would take turns buying 24s that we consumed collectively. Each of us had our favourite brands, and by the end of the semester, one side of the dining room was filled to the ceiling with cases of James Ready, Sleeman Honey Brown, Moosehead, and of course Maclays. We hauled the wall of bottles in and traded the deposit money for a couple more 24s of the same brands... and some Fosters, because we wanted to try something more exotic, I guess?

Maclays might technically be an ale, but they really shouldn't advertise it without putting an asterisk beside the word. For a buck-a-beer, it's reasonably good value though and if I were comparing this to other macros I'd have to give it at least a C+... but taken as an English-style pale ale, it's total garbage.

O/D - Unpleasantly dry. An odd beer. The dryness was funky and the flavours weren't pleasant. Wouldn't get it again. The alcohol doesn't exactly give you any bang for the buck either. Even though it's so light, it still has an unpleasantness.",2.0

M - Light and overcarbonated.

Hahn Premium Light,"Pours a pale golden colour with slow carbonation but quite a lot. Head is medium, resembling an old cobweb at parts, but retains for the most part. Lacing is a thick curtain, as per most Aus lagers.

Uneventful nose, a bit sweet like it has traces of rice in there, slightly metallic hop. All very weak. Unimpressed indeed.

Taste is similarly weak. Mostly watery with a slight sweetish buttery taste. Aftertaste is very metallic and chemical, with a sharp chemical hang, but again nothing too strong. Yes I know this is a light beer. That just makes it piss weak and flat. If taste were there though it would be horrible. Nothing to recommend.",2.0

Hahn Premium Light,"Look.... had this having no choice really... was driving, had already knocked back a couple of decent beers, so took a draught middy this.

I'm not going to analyse it any great depth... it's a light beer. But I will just mention a strange sense I was drinking a mild. For a moment, if I closed my eyes, I detected some richer malt notes that would have tricked me into thinking the beer was darker than it was.

Strange.... maybe some very pale crystal in there to give this effect.

Still not a beer I recommend.",2.5
Hahn Premium Light,"Don't ask me why I have a bottle of this. I think I grabbed it from a free event because I figured I'd never reviewed it, and I wasn't going to fork out my own cash on it... Anyway, here we go...

Pours a clear golden colour. Lots of carbonation. REasonable fluffy white head. Look alright, all things said and done.

Absolutely nothing on the nose whatsoever. Water has more smell than this (I mean, at least Sydney water has that chlorine character to it...). Hmm. No, alright, there's a (very slight) grainy or vegetative arome, but this is very, very faint.

Taste is inoffensive, slightly metallic and very thin. Not much to it, but you'd be hard pressed to call it ""unpleasant"".

It's bland, no two ways about it. But it's not undrinkable. I've had much worse beers than this - beers that you can't finish, or want to tip down the sink. While this ""beer"" is insulting to the true breweries out there, it's not something that's truly unpleasant.",2.5
Hahn Premium Light,"Appearance - 2.5
Poured only half a finger of white head, even after a reasonably hard pour, but it remained at a thin layer for quite a while. Looks highly carbonated, the colour is a clear bronzy yellow, not unlike that of their full-strength lager.

Smell - 2.0
No skunk, so it must be pretty fresh, considering the clear bottle. A rather weak smell which doesn't strengthen with warming, but there is some malt sweetness and grains.

Taste - 2.5
For a light beer, this is really not too bad; it's refreshing and doesn't have any real nasty flavours. Truthfully, it doesn't really have much flavour at all, there is a whisper of sweetness, cheap white bread, grains, slightly metallic and a very slight bitter hop presence in the dry finish. Slight sour aftertaste with no real flavour.

Mouthfeel - 3.0
Moderate to highly carbonated, feels light in the mouth, but not quite watery. Pretty thin, but that is expected for the style.

Drinkability - 3.5
Definitely scores points for the low alcohol, but anyone who wants flavour will be bored in no time.

OVERALL - 2.55
For its style, this beer stands up pretty well. Overall it's not a great brew, but I would usually choose it over a soft drink, so it cannot be that bad. Inoffensive, refreshing and sessionable for those who don't mind the lack of flavour. It's also cheap which is a plus, but just a little more money and you can start to get some truly decent beers, which would always be my preference.",3.5
Hahn Premium Light,"Pours a light golden color with lots of white chunky head that seems to stick around for a while. Not much in the way of aroma. Very faint yeast smell. Not a whole lot of flavor, some sweetness and a little chemical bitterness, and a lingering nasty metallic taste on the backend. Might be the aluminum can, but I've had other cans without that taste. Mouthfeel is very watery with a slight rasp from the carbonation. All in all, a below average beer. For an aussie macro, still below average.",1.5

I thoroughly enjoy Old Style, despite a lot of the divided and often negative opinions it merits (my father cites it and Miller High Life as the two worst beers he has ever had), and this light alternative is almost the same in terms of matching how filling its brother beer is. Other than that, it brings a middling taste to the table, but after Miller 64, everything seems so exquisite in flavor.",2.5

On the tongue, Taj Mahal is light bodied and fairly smooth and crisp. Taj Mahal tastes like pale malts and toasted cereal grains with hints of adjunct sweetness which contrast the cereal grains without actually adding anything to the proceedings.

Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention fading over time to leave a tiny bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strongest of a grainy smell mixed with some aromas of cracker malt and a touch of grass.
Taste – The taste begins with a cracker malt taste with a touch of caramel and some light grainy flavors. These flavors constitute the base flavor of the brew and last throughout. Toward the end of the taste a little bit of grass and some hay come to the tongue, leaving one with a rather crisp lager taste to linger on the tongue.

Taste: I don't mind some Asian adjunct beers - some actually make the rice taste quite nice. This is not one of those beers. An awkward fug from the rice, and only cheap and light cereals to back it up.

Aftertaste: more rice awkwardness on the finish. Not a great beer.

This is very highly carbonated and resembles pop..providing a carbonated ring around the glass at the top of the brew. There is also no lacing to speak of but instead an oily looking film covering my glass. Not very impressive to look at!

S- Typical Chinese lager aromas, being very similar to BMC type beer. Sweet malt/rice adjuncts dominate...it smells very similar to a piece of fermented rice cake dessert that I tried recently...not super appealing to be honest. I don't smell any of the hops that are said to be used in this either.

T- Well it tastes better than it smells, but not by much...it follows fairly close to the aroma. Again, there is sweet malt and/or rice, which actually keeps it clean tasting.

M- Thin and watery, which isn't unexpected...afterall, this is brewed for the Asian population and I think for the climate it's intended for, it works. It's very carbonated and scrubs the palate accordingly.

Definitely not as good as I remember. If offered, I would not turn it down but I would not seek it out.",2.5
Labatt Blue,"In terms of cheaper beers, I think this is one of the better ones.",3.25
Labatt Blue,Has a pretty light taste like most macros. Better and cheaper than PBR,3.75
Labatt Blue,"Embarking on an Adjunct Adventure lately, seeing if I can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests PBR for my taste buds. This one is pretty decent - no offensive smells or flavors. A light-bodied, easy-drinking bready malt I would be happy to revisit.",3.5
Labatt Blue,"Nothing jumped out at me but the straw of the barley taste, the corn and other adjuncts made it taste like how I think Canada's beer tastes. I see this as another Molson, but I do like it. It is just not a beer I would get again, nor would I turn it down at a party. I liked the flavor of the water, I liked the malt but there is something about it that is just not my style. I would hate only to overall this a 3/5 But I see others rating it 63/100 so I would agree.",3.0
Labatt Blue,It’s one of my go to beers at the grocery store. A 6pack is cheaper than American beer at Publix. Try it with a little real ginger ale for a ginger beer.,3.75
Labatt Blue,"Good ol Labatt Blue, the Bud of the Canadian market. In University I always remember folks considering Labatt and Molson the typical Canadian macro, and Moosehead was ‘the good stuff’.

Pours a classic light yellow straw colour. Fizzy finger and a half head foams and dissipates as fast as it arrives.

Sweet aroma on the nose, corn and sweet wheaty notes. A little bit of generic cereal grains. Mild and inoffensive.

Taste follows closely to what you smell. Recommended, like many macros, to drink ice cold. The sweetness opens up as it warms to the point of stickiness, like when you get a mouthful of mushy alphabits cereal or rice krispies that have been sitting in a bowl of sugared milk for an hour. Slight bitterness that has a slight metallic flavour to it, but still retains a slight edge of grassiness of the hops.

Light bodied with medium carbonation, very crisp mouthfeel, not a very long finish, finishes fairly bland with a slight graininess.

As I say for most of the macros I revisit, it’s not worth just buying something else at the same cost or an extra quarter per beer to get an explosively better experience. Especially in Canada where our alcohol prices are terrible, it is absolutely not hard to find another macro or even plenty of cheaper microbrews and craft. Most of the high ratings have to do with nostalgia, which is a powerful motivator of course. Nothing wrong with that. But for a beer many describe as ‘that easy drinking workhorse/good for mowing lawns/etc’, there is absolutely no doubt you can find better for the same price.

That being said, if you like Labatt, then go for it. It’s not my thing anymore, but if you like it, that’s what BA is for. Ranking beers on your own preference. You don’t gotta try to justify it based on anything else than the fact you enjoy the taste yourself.",2.75

Labatt Blue,"Finally got up north enough to grab a 12 pack of cans. Haven't had this in years/decades
pours out a typical light straw gold, but more color than i expected. Fizzy one inch white head dies down pretty fast.
Smells - it's basically a light sweetness, like a hint of sweet corn. Not awful, but very basic.
Taste is light, sweet ,basic and pretty decent. Clean enough finish .
Overall, it's pretty much a cereal/corn flake type of taste that can be slammed easily and enjoyable with cheap food.",3.25
Labatt Blue,"This is a good basic beer. I'm a working man. I don't have a budget for a lot of craft beers. I buy this regularly and it satisfies me the way my old Ford Escape gets me where I want to go even in a foot of snow. Sorry to be basic. Feel a little out of place here. But if you can't afford steak, there's nothing like a good hamburger.",4.0
Labatt Blue,"Pours a typical pale straw. Eggshell white head comes on all frothy and then pulls a vanishing act. Tiny little bubbles lazily float towards the top of the glass. It doesn't look terribly appealing but it looks the part of an adjunct lager and so you can't rate it too harshly. Smells like lightly sweetened cereal and not much else. Alphabits without the marshmallows? Maybe a little grassy if I dig deep. Tastes, you know, pretty much like it smells with a mild bitter hop bite. It's not especially tasty, but it's far from offensive. *shrug* Very crispy up front, though it does mellow a bit on the finish. Yeah; not much to say. This is perfectly drinkable swill that reminds me of my youth. Hard to believe I used to think this stuff was objectively good.",2.75

Labatt Blue,"I'm gunna go ahead and purger myself here and say, I love this beer. The only real downside to me is they can charge more for it not being domestic. If I was Canadian, I would fight Molson fans over this. This beer is like the winner of basic go to of Canadian beers. Put this up to a bud and I will take it 5 times outta 5. Deport me now I'll gladly go. You can taste the hops. It has weight. It doesn't come over as watery or cheap. It also isn't a hipster ipa level bitter. Bitter should be a slight part of a beers flavor profile, not the whole thing. This beer does it. If they refined it a bit to get it outta that value level flavor it would be a killer. I like it and I'm not ashamed",3.75
Labatt Blue,"Guys, this was a 70s beer - back when it was a canadian owned company - the stuff you drank while you were driving around with your highschool buddies, smoking weed, listening to Led Zep with the windows rolled down on a Sat night in the dead of an upstate NY winter - so about zero degrees far or colder. the beer was cold and crisp - kinda like your face - you were basically numb so taste didn't really enter into it and who really gave a Fk? one thing you noticed, when the car skidded to a halt on the snow covered asphalt and you stumbled out to take a p*ss, the color of the beer matched the color of your stream - if that ain't poetry i don't know what is? Fkn A.",5.0
Labatt Blue,"This time it came from a tap into a clear pint glass. Light amber colored and bright, but very translucent. A reasonable head and glass lacing accompany the visual. It's an adjunct lager and a Pilsner at that, so the lack of aroma is expected, not disappointing. What is disappointing is that it provides a hint of a good Pilsner up front, but the finish is pretty bad. There's absolutely no sharp, dry and clean finish, as a good Pilsner will have. Instead, it's blandly malty and characterless, with a little unwelcomed yeastiness. In Pennsylvania, we don't need beers like this to travel hundreds of miles to get here. We've got local mediocre beers aplenty.",2.75
Labatt Blue,"Solid shitbeer. Yes this qualifies as a shitbeer in my opinion. Though the flavor isn't bad it's just nothing special. A bit watery but still serves a solid beer taste. I could see this coming in handy at a party. Very easy to chug, the carbonation is not overwhelming like other shitbeers. Wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't complain if it was my only choice.",3.0
Labatt Blue,"First off, aggressive pour, little to no head retention. Looks like Wal-Mart apple juice. Smells like almost nothing. I work at an asphalt plant, so that may just be me. Taste? Slightly sweet (ish) carbonated water, absolutely NOTHING off- putting about this pilsner, better from the bottle straight out of the cooler, or fridge, than a glass or mug, IMHO. Good carbonation, mouthfeel is nice and crisp. ULTRA refreshing, especially when cold. This is a great fishing/ beach/ mowing/ whatever the hell you do on the weekend beer, especially at just 4.7% ABV. Not bad, but I prefer beer with more flavor...and more alcohol.... It will definitely fill you up before you get tanked, that's for sure. Overall, a solid weekender when you actually have to get shit done.",3.0

Labatt Blue,"This pours a golden hue with a good amount of carbonation and a decent head that sticks around for a while.

The aroma is slightly bread like but sweetness mostly dominates here.

Taste-wise at first it seems slightly more robust than your average American Lager however there is still that sweetness in the finish. Also a bit of grain is present. It finishes pretty smooth with very little bitterness.

All in all this isn't a bad beer whatsoever. It is easily drinkable but there are still better examples of this style from the American side of the border.",3.5

Genesee Beer,"Poured from an undated 12oz can into my pils glass.

On the pour a light 2 finger fine head forms, then over the course of a couple minutes it dissipates to a ring around the glass. The body is a light golden straw with relatively lazy carbonation for the style. No lacing.

Aroma is quite malty with some nice crackery notes, and the yeast is also quite detectable but in a slightly estery generically beery sort of way. Everything smells very light. There is a slight hint of grassy herbal hops. For the style this isn't half bad. As the beer warms diacetyl does become noticable.

Flavor is quite similar to the aroma but with some detectable adjunct sweetness. Hop bitterness is present but vague and the malt is quite sweet. Again once the beer warms diacetyl is present, keep this one cold and probably don't pour it into a pils glass.

Feel is crisp with a high carbonation bite and a nice foamy head to make the beer feel softer. This is a very cheap beer and for the price it could be a whole lot worse, it's pretty dang drinkable.

Overall this is a cheap full flavor lager that isn't terrible with a nice malty character. There is some off but as long as it stays cold it's a pretty good budget option.",2.75

Genesee Beer,"Being from northeastern Ohio this has been a staple of my beer consuming years. Genesee is not a complex lager and is an easy drinking beer. There are no off setting flavors to speak of and its simplicity makes it very drinkable. Barley malt, yes, corn grits because that's what American and Canadian brewers use to brew for the masses and then finally
hops. Genesee ""red eye"" doesn't have the off putting vegetable oil flavor of MHL or the wet carboard flavor of A.B. You can drink 1 or 6, the flavor is consistent and if your in the mood for a boiler maker this is the perfect choice hands down.",3.75

I'm glad to see this brewery is still around, especially with the onslaught of takeovers in the late 70's and 80's, and I wish it many more years, but this old mainstay beer needs to return to its glory years when it was one of the better mainstream beers on the east coast.",2.5

Labatt Ice,"Nabbed a 24 fl oz pull-tab can at a crappy bodega in Brooklyn, NY. Hey, where's my ""extra"" 1 oz the 25oz macros offer!?

5.6% ABV.

APPEARANCE: I knew what was coming and it delivered...pours your usual thin quickly-receding head (~20 second retention) and has that classic fizzy yellow body. Well, I guess it's more of a pale copper, but it's superbly clear, lacking any yeast/lees or other particulate. Appears undercarbonated and of low quality, tending towards the syrupy side for an adjunct lager (I prefer watery adjunct lagers, for the record).

AROMA: Corn syrup/extract brings the adjunct sweetness to the table, joining cheap 6-row barley and some syrupy graininess. I actually like the graininess as it lends some needed perceived bitterness. No luck on the hop front here - not even a generic floral hop aromatic. A blip of metallic character, but it's barely noticeable.

Certainly seems too sweet and suggests a syrupy brew, but it's not boozy and I don't get any DMS or other off-notes.

Aromatic intensity is quite light.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Too sweet and too syrupy, but not egregiously so on either count. I'll be able to kill this 24 fl oz can, and it's not boozy. No DMS, but there's some buttery flavour that might indicate potential diacetyl. No brettanomyces off-flavour. Corn syrup adjunct eclipses any graininess or 6-row, unfortunately.

Imbalanced and off-putting. Too thick for an adjunct lager and for its lack of flavour. Unrefreshing. I'd prefer a lighter body or even a watery feel. Smooth. Wet. Unappealing.

OVERALL: It's a pretty subpar brew across the board, with shallow depth of flavour, painful simplicity, and no hop flavour or interesting yeast character whatsoever. That said, I've had worse and it's not as sweet, syrupy, or off-flavour emphatic as many beers in the style. I'd be after Miller High Life, Hamms, Schaefer, or Genesee at a ball-game or summer barbeque over this, but it's preferable to many budget expressions of the style and I'll enjoy finishing the can. My low expectations were met but not exceeded, and sometimes you're in the mood for a mundane adjunct lager.

Crazy Stallion,This says lager on the 24oz can. For 1.25 for 24 oz I was intrigued. Popping the top I get grape juice. Pour is classic Amber with a weak head. On the taste I get grape juice with angostura bitters. Like a weak old fashioned. For $0.05 per oz I am not complaining. Not offensive and a great looking can. I think I found a new chugged to hang at the BBQ in 95 degrees.,3.5
Crazy Stallion,"This isn't your normal type of beer, for 1.25 this is a friendly type of beer. Many may say "" oh it has a metallic taste"" but what were they drinking metal? Can't be compared to natty cause it doesn't taste water downed, can't be compared to let's say Heineken cause it's a bit malt liqour. This beer can hit the spot when you're in the dumps. Besides this the only other beer that can live up to it is the olde English 800. Too bad they don't make 40 oz of this cause damn that would sure turn the market around. God bless the U.S of A",3.75
Crazy Stallion,"Was unexpectedly heading to the local commuter train and passed a bodega so I decided to grab a beverage to enjoy on my hour long trip. I spied this wonderful looking 24 oz. can in the cooler and was immediately inspired to take a closer look. Hand crafted, the ""label"" said (BTW what do you call the outside of a can? It isn't technically a label, but I digress). American made. Original even. And a Classic Lager. How could it get any better? Than, in the upper left corner of the aforementioned ""label"" was the coup de grace. $1.25! How could it be possible for such a highly touted product to be priced at such an inviting level? And for 1 PT, 8 FL OZ of anticipated golden nectar. It could only because prime example of American ingenuity at its finest. I had to have it and have it NOW!

Caught my train by the skin of my teeth. Found a seat and prepared myself for the journey, both in the physical and the emotional. As the train departed the station, I cracked open the plebian tab that stood between me and the experience I so longed to have.

How to rate this libation? How to describe it? The question of look remains unexplored. It is truly unfair to fault the beer for this so I fairly (I feel) out this required rating smack dab in the middle of the field. How could one even consider using and vessel but the magnificent aluminum that naturally covers it. Luckily the aroma is able to we escape through the approximately inch wide circle created by the escape valve commonly referred to as the tab. I can think of no other words to describe this than sickeningly sweet. This is not a value judgement, mind you, but a descriptive fact. A negative? Who am I to make such a judgement on an esteemed product like Crazy Stallion.

But we know why you all are here. To discover the taste, the flavor, how does Crazy Stallion tickle the tongue. I can only confirm that I absolutely got my $1.25 (actually $1.50 once you calculate the government's share of the experience) of value. And what more can one truly ask for. Indeed, what more. This Crazy Stallion was possibly one of the finest travelling companions I have ever had on a commuter rail journey.",5.0
Crazy Stallion,"I picked up a 24oz tallboy at my local bodega for $1.25. I drank about half and poured the rest out. Has a awful sour metallic taste, like it’s been sitting in the can for years. I won’t buy it again.",1.25
Crazy Stallion,"$1.25 for a 24 oz beer can't beat that these days. I was pretty surprised how good this beer was. Tasted pretty good and if it's 5.9% abv then that is amazing. Doesn't really taste like its 5.9% seems about maybe 5% or somewhere between 4% to 5% abv but it says 5.9% on here so I guess that's what it is.

I was thinking this was gonna be more crazy than it was you know since it says Crazy Stallion I was thinking it would be some pretty good stuff like Natty Daddy but was quite mild for the name crazy stallion. Should probably just be called grazing stallion or something like that.

Taste reminds me of those cheap no brand beers they sell at some places that are about 4% to 5% abv. Taste reminds me of that cheap beer they sell at walgreens you get the 6 pack for like 3 or 4 dollars or something.

The taste is pretty good for the price kind of a low carbonated flavor beer pretty decent. The main thing is the type of buzz you get really which seemed to be like a sleepy beer. Had to take a nap felt drowsy after drinking this. Not really a stimulating beer. But probably gonna definitely give it some more tries to see what its like some more. Maybe I may try this beer again but seems like that beer they sell at walgreens and has the same drowsy effect.

Crazy Stallion,"I about sprayed my shorts when I found this at the corner store for a whole $1.25, so I couldn't resist. I figured it couldn't be any worse than some of those other gut-wrenching malt liquors I've tried lately so I gave it a go. Needless to say I wasn't impressed nor was I dissapointed. For $1.25, it wasn't bad. I was expecting that overwhelming malt liquor taste but instead I was hit with a mouthful of aluminum tasting smooth. I have no idea what the alcohol content is as the can doesn't mention it anywhere to my knowledge but not to long after binging it, I felt a wee bit buzzed. I think after downing about 6 of these in rapid succession I will gain a new perspective on life. In conclusion if you're looking for something tasty, this isn't for you. If you are however seeking something buzz-worthy I'd give this a go.",3.5

D / NOT RECOMMENDED

03/23/17 2nd impression from a 24 fl oz can I couldn't resist picking up for a scant $1.25 in Brooklyn.

""Ale."" ""American made."" ""Strong lager."" ""Brewed by Hornell Brewing Co., La Crosse, WI.""

APPEARANCE: Off-white head retains for about 2 minutes, leaving no lacing as it recedes. Body colour is a clear yellow-copper of average vibrance. Clean, with no yeast/lees within.

AROMA: Malt syrup/extract, corn adjunct, metallic off-notes, graininess, stale grass.

The graininess is nice, but the rest suggests an abysmal overly sweet sticky brew that will be a chore to finish. Aromatic intensity is subdued.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Syrupy and sweet, with an off-puttingly thick hefty presence on the palate that's quite poor when coupled with its sharp overcarbonated. Metallic off-flavour really cripples this brew, but it's cloying and corn adjunct-emphatic besides. There's not a lot to like here, and I think I'd take a watery thinness over this syrupy consistency.

Alcohol isn't disguised, but it's not a hot or boozy beer by any stretch.

OVERALL: Quite poorly executed fare for a malt liquor (or ""strong lager,"" as they style it). The adjunct isn't necessarily what bugs me; the bigger issues are the mouthfeel and off-flavours. I've encountered more offensive beers with far more imbalance, but this isn't a beer I'd revisit over others in the budget category, and I think Ballantine XXX is worth the extra ~4 cents per ounce more, unless your only goal is intoxication (in which case, why aren't you drinking St. Ides or High Gravity Steel Reserve?). Certainly a student beer to put it politely, but neither the worst nor the best of them. I'll finish the can with some effort, but I can't recommend it to anyone.

D (2.12) / NOT RECOMMENDED

***
07.13.17 impression from a budget can acquired at a wrap party after a film shoot:

Clear pale copper body with a thin white coloured cap atop. Head retention is okay; 2-3 minutes but reducing inconsistently and with abrupt ""pops"" of head loss. Leaves some inconsistent cobwebby lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes.

Aroma is of corn adjunct, slightly syrupy 6 row sweetness, and a borderline funky skunkiness as though the beer is lightstruck in spite of coming from a can. Has an off-putting stale metallic edge. No real hop aromatics aside from faded grass. Reticent aromatically but nevertheless suggestive of a largely insipid brew aside from its evident off-flavours. I've encountered far worse aromas and it doesn't seem *that* syrupy.

Taste isn't awful but it has an off-putting syrupy mouthfeel coupled with a style-inappropriate dryness on the finish that really brings it down for me. The adjunct isn't actually all that noticeable, hiding beneath the more overt up-front cheap 6-row barley sweetness. Hops aren't a factor in this build, with none of the stale grass the aroma suggested coming through...though it'd be strangely welcome.

Not dreadfully overcarbonated, nor is it watery - which is more than I can admit about many a beer offered at this price in the U.S.A. to its credit. One can imagine the off-flavour(s) more prominent.

It's a poor brew, no doubt, but it isn't repugnant or egregious in its bad execution. I've had worse, and this isn't as syrupy or boozy as many malt liquors. Its main draw for any drinker - casual or discerning - will be its price, but that has no effect on my rating. It's a rough garbage brew that even buzz-hungry students in its distribution region will turn their noses up at, and you can do far better even with less money in terms of purely-for-drunkiness beers, but all things considered it's not abysmal...and that might be the best thing I can say about it.

Crazy Stallion,"This beer doesn't deserve a fancy review, much the same way a frozen dinner wouldn't be admitted in a cook-off.

Really, don't expect anything except a metallic, very hoppy yet somewhat easy-going-down ghetto swill.

Quilmes,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head fades rather fast leaving just a touch of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is light overall, but is heaviest of a slightly grainy and bready smell mixed with some smells of caramel. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a hay.
Taste – The taste begins with a caramel malt taste that has a bit of grain and a decent shot of doughiness. As the taste advances some flavors of a light herbal and hay taste come to the tongue. All the while the sweet caramel fades a bit and the doughiness gets more cracker like in nature. These transitions cause the taste to crisp up a bit and leave one with a somewhat lighter and more crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the flavor profile the feel is rather well done and makes for a very easy sipper overall.
Overall – Nothing spectacular, but very easy drinking and rather refreshing overall. A rather nice warm weather session brew!",3.5

The taste is a little more like what I had been expecting, but only a little. Sweet, almost overly sweet, with almost no bitterness. But wait! There's a little pale, biscuity malt poking through here and it is a relief, it saves this beer from use as Slug-bait and/or Drainpour Land (although the first would certainly be a good use for this stuff...).

Smooth, yes, but very thin-bodied, very much like a Diet or Light lager -- I'm guessing that better than 30% of the fermentables bill is corn syrup. Mouthfeel is about the same as the taste...

The beer, however, is very average and similar to every Euro green bottled lager of all time. The beer pours into the classic straw color of most green bottle brews, but does produce a fairly frothy white top for a beer as session-like as this. Corn and grain notes are prominent in the scent and thats really accurate for the taste too. Not really impressed, but it is smooth, crisp and refreshing.

Burleigh Bighead,"Bottle: has a child with an enormous head on it. Enough said.

Appearance: considering this is a 'no-carb' beer, not too bad. That said, it looks a bit weak and flat, with a bubbling head that dissipates too quickly.

Aroma: very little in the way of aroma. What vague whiff is apparent is standard grains. Quite dull.

Taste: I don't really see the point of beers like this. Breweries have to understand that if a beer has almost no flavour, the only flavour that will come through is an awful, skunky off-metal grain. Mighty unimpressive.

Aftertaste: disappears quickly, thank God. Still, that's half the problem - there isn't that much flavour to begin with.

Mouth feel: thin and watery, with limited carbonation. Just keeps getting better...

Overall: a pointless and hatefully awful beer from a brewer that ought to know better. With their range of fantastic beers, this is a truly awful deviation from the norm. Add to that the fact that it is the price of standard full-strength, it is actually quite insulting. If you want a beer, buy one. If you really want a decent boutique light, get a Rogers Beer. If you just want a reasonable light lager, go for your standard macro White Stag, XXXX Gold, Cascade Light, etc. I can assure you they are much, much better value, and taste a whole lot better.

Burleigh Bighead,"@tobeerornottobe said ""Do you have a lighter beer?"" Oh yes, I sure do...

Pours very clear and very light, with minimal body and a filmy, pure white head. Lacing is relatively persistent and leaves a pleasant frothy pattern down the inside of the glass. No, it's not a brilliant looking beer, but it's very decent for the style.

Nose is crisp and adjuncty, with a note of corn or DMS, and a slightly sharper I-almost-want-to-call-it-hoppiness. But then it sinks back to sweet corn syrup and light vomitous astringency. No, not for me.

Taste is almost devoid of character, even feeling—it's as though this beer disappears as soon as you put it in your mouth. Very thin and only leaving a hint of that corn because it has to. Really reminiscent of a wet tortilla. Appalling.

Really horrible beer., of the kind that makes you scream out in disgust as to why it was ever brewed. No carb beer? It should be illegal.",1.5

Not of good beer. Claims to be be a no carb beer, better described as a no taste beer.

Almost clear in appearence. And lacked any sort of smell.

Given the lack of colour and smell it was not surprising that it lacked a certian amount of taste. It wasn't an offensive taste, it just didn't taste of anything. It was refreshing I give it that, and if it was really, really hot, it would be a plesant drinking experience, but if you actually want your beer to taste like beer, I'd give it a miss.

It seemed to have gone after the gimmick (nop carbs) rather than trying to produce a flavoursome beer. It's a shame as I hear the rest of the Burleigh range is okay.",1.5

A- Golden and clear, medium head which dissipates quickly leaving little to no lacing.

T- Light sweetness, simple grain bill is obvious. Little to no malt character. Some Dyacetyl. Very light bitterness. A slight hop flavour of apple skin. Overall very bland

M- Low carbonation, doesnt help things. Thin and watery body. Quite smooth is the only positive, it doesnt seem to show as many of the tinny, chemical, artificial and over filtered feeling you get with a macro beer.

D- a pretty disappointing beer. I can see why they would want to get on the bandwagon with the whole (frankly usless) low carb influx but its disappointing to see it coming from a microbrewery. I know its low carb so not to expect much but... why bother?",2.0
Red Horse Beer: Extra Strong,"Red Horse Extra Strong is crystal clear and pale amber in color. Thin streams of carbonation support a cloudy bone white head with fairly average retention.
Taking a sniff, the first thing I smell is generic, almost sugary sweetness. Soda cracker comes in second, lending support to the up front aromas of sugar. Aromas of malt and sugar lead into a center where I smell corn adjuncts and the lagery whiff of sulfur. Mix in the alcoholic burn of this beer's 8% abv and the aroma takes on a vaguely white wine quality. The finish is full of the leafy, fresh cut grass smell of European hops.
On the tongue, flavors of corn adjunct and alcoholic spiciness dominate up front. Those flavors lead right into flavors of sulfur. Those flavors combine in a way that isn't very flattering or enticing. Flavors of soda cracker or baked bread are nonexistent. Sugary sweetness provides an interesting through note, adding just enough to the proceedings to give an unflattering illusion of white wine. Bitter is crisp and bitter.
It's just not that good a beer. It's almost as though the brewery took every thing people hate about lager and distilled them together into one product. Red Horse Extra Strong's only real redeeming feature is that it's inexpensive and it's strong. Beyond, I'd give this beer a hard pass.",2.5

Imported straight from the dungeons of a strange Filipino brewery and right to your local liquor store, this beer trumps over stronger beers in it's class like Colt 45 and Labatt Blue Dry which clocks in at 8.1%. Red Horse lacks the obnoxious taste carried by the greaseball beer of choice, Colt 45 , and still manages to stand at an impressive 8% which you'll feel pretty quick. Sadly, I don't have the nose to detect a lot of the smells most of the other reviewers do. Taste does a fantastic job of hiding that alcohol taste and still manages to procure a good, stable taste which does not offend or cause projectile vomiting. My first experience with this was a 6pk purchased from a kindly Iranian couple's liquor store. Chuck in a few 2L wine coolers and some Counter Strike: Global Offensive and you end up with the terrorists winning and a killer hangover.

My second and perhaps last encounter with this bucking stallion was a mid-autumn day drink wherein we ended up inside the husk of a broken down combine/tractor wreck drinking Red Horse in 500ml cans and 6pks as well as some more 2L ciders and a few alcoholic energy drinks.

Hell On High Quad Bock,"Rinkuškiai ""Hell On High Quad Bock""
16.9 fl. oz brown glass bottle, coded ""L.10443""
$2.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: Against my own better judgement having already had one of the strong beers from Rinkuškiai I'm going to go ahead and try ""Hell On High"". At least the label is good with a devilish looking character petting a white poodle. So, even with a rough pour I was unable to bring up a head. There's a little bubbly foam here and there but not much. That really hurts it in terms of appearance. The body is a very hazy deep amber with an orange sheen and golden highlights. The aroma is malty and caramelish with a light bit of apple-like fruitiness. The flavor follows and I'm quite surprised, it's much better than I thought it would be. The rich caramel maltiness is pleasant and not overdone, and there are no off-flavors. The alcohol does show slightly but I think it's actually helping to dry it in the finish along with its median bitterness, some herbal hops, and refreshing apple-like fruitiness. It could be a more carbonated but it's not bad, it works well with the full bodied maltiness. I'm going to guess it's around 2.0 volumes of CO2 where a standard beer is around 2.5 and a cask ale is more like 1.8. I keep smelling it, swirling it, waiting to find something bad come out as it warms but it hasn't happened yet. However, more and more alcohol is showing but we'll see if all of that malt keeps it in balance ... ... ... hmm, it's stayed pretty much the same except that it has lost some carbonation which leaves it even softer, and that hurts it on mouthfeel despite it's chewy maltiness. The bottle label did say it was bottle conditioned but I highly doubt that, and even if it was, it's hard to coax enough carbonation out at 14% ABV. So, what to say? It's perfect for malt heads, and those who just love strong beers. For anyone else it's more like a golden caramel flavored dessert beer, and even in that it's pretty one-sided. I'm surprised it's as clean as it is, and so not-hot with alcohol, but that's not enough to pull it beyond a decent beer despite it's ""quad bock"" status.",3.75

and beaten to death by strong warming grain booze. Decent mouth feel, warming and

Hell On High Quad Bock,"A: The beer is crystal clear yellowish amber in color and has a light amount of carbonation. It poured with a short white head that quickly died down, leaving only a thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas candied apples and caramel are present in the nose along with hints of fusel alcohol.
T: The taste is quite sweet and malty, having lots of flavors of apples, brown bread, caramel, and raisins along hints of alcohol.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. No stickiness is perceptible.
O: For a 14% abv beer, this does a good job at hiding most of the alcohol from the taste, although the flavors can seem more like fruits that were soaked in alcohol. The taste also seems to be somewhat rancid, which impacts the drinkability more than the alcohol does.

Hell On High Quad Bock,"I found this single 16.9oz bottle at Springbrook Liquors in Bloomingdal, ILe for $2.69. Cool name and nice looking label, but that's the only cool thing about this beer.

The beer poured a cloudy honey gold color with a 2½-finger dish soap looking white head that lasted a little over a minute but left no lacing whatsoever.

The beer had only one smell - that of mild caramel.

Yuk! This is total drain pour. It tastes like hard rock candy dipped in caramel and then re-dipped and soaked in alcohol. Absolutely horrid.

Disgustingly sweet and alcoholic with zero carbonation.

Hell On High Quad Bock,"I picked up a bottle of Rinkuskiai's Hell On High Quad Bock a couple weeks ago for $4.69 at The Beer Depot. This beer really caught my eye and It's been a while since I've tried one of these crazy Lithuanian beers, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date. Poured from a brown 22oz bottle poured into a teku.

A- The label is awesome, it goes great with name and it's really eye catching. It poured a nice orange color that took on more of an amber color with just a small ring of head that quickly faded away and it didn't leave any lacing behind. This beer looks ok, but it would be nice if it had some head and lacing.

S- The aroma starts off with a high amount of sweetness with the malts being the first to show up and they impart lots of sweet malts, caramel malts, apple juice and raisin like aromas with a little bit of a brown bread aromas also showing up. Up next comes the alcohol which is pretty noticeable and it's followed by a little more sweetness. The aroma is ok, but it's very sweet.

T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a high amount of sweetness with the malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in aroma with the all the aspects seeming to show up pretty evenly. Up next comes the alcohol which is pretty noticeable, but it's not as boozy and warming as I was expecting. On the finish there's more sweetness with a candied aftertaste. This taste was Ok, I was expecting a little more flavor, but at least it's not super boozy.

M- Not smooth, cloying, not crisp, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a low amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel isn't that great and I wish it had some more carbonation.

Overall I thought this beer was ok and I thought it was an average example of the style, it had most of the aspects that I expect from these high alcohol bocks, but in the end it seemed to be lacking on the flavor. This beer didn't have great drinkability, one glass is more than enough for me. What I like the most about this beer was the label it was awesome. What I like the least about this beer was the high sweetness and the lack of carbonation. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was nice to try, but it isn't something I feel the need to revisit. It's worth a try if you like these strong bocks, but I can't say I recommend it. All in all it's not bad and it's not as boozy as I was expecting, but I wish it had some flavor to it. It made for an ok first impression for this brewery and it's average for the style. Nice job guys, but a little more carbonation and less sweetness wouldn't hurt.",3.0

Not a whole lot to write home about, but it is what it is. Now for the taste is light and watery. You pick up on faint notes of grins and malts. For what it worth this is a nice clean crisp drinking brew. Has the mouth feel of water. Now I giving this non alcoholic brew a honest review. I have tried other non alcoholic brews on the market and for the most part they are all the same. This one lacks flavor. I thought there honestly would be more to this brew.

Aroma is hint of grassy rubberyness. Taste is water with a tinge of corn and lightly sweet cornflakes breakfast cereal. Carbonation was low to medium low.

Finishes starting lightly sweet then the taste of tap water. No body at all, pure wateryness. Like drinking a low sugar watery soda or taking a poor pale lager and watering it down with semi-flat seltzer water.

Instead, I got a film of head that CANtinued to bubble and burble away. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose reminded me of an adjunct lager in terms of its inherent honey and grain-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was much too thin to be of any merit. Way watery and I CANnot forgive that! Still, it had a light sweetness, lager-like, albeit muted. Finish was pleasant, slightly refreshing, worth drinking, if you are in the mood for an N.

Genesee NA,"Ok, I'm going to explain why I review low-alcohol beer. I've always been under the impression that beer with no alcohol is basically malty water and tasteless.

Pours a light golden color with a one-finger head and what appears to be ample carbonation into my glass.

Aroma is sweet and grainy and not much else. Seems about right for the style.

Taste is light, sweet and grainy. Seems rather rough in the middle and fades to nearly nothing in the back.

Mouthfeel is the same I guess. Lingering sweetness, graininess and etc, etc.

I'm only trying the NAs so I'd have something to drink on New Years, but YIKES.

S: dried apple, hint of white grape atop a powdered-donut doughy malt base; soft clove spice, subtle cookie-ish baked grain note... no one element really stands out, fair-moderate potency... malt fades in favor of spice and dried pomme

F: satiny smooth, little afterburn... arguably a tad watery in the finish; arguably needs a lil more heat; otherwise dream drag and drop

The nose is sweet and yeasty with some slight spoiled grain smell. Meh, the smell is boring. For flavor, this is not exceptional but very similar to Miller high life. Top end sweetness with faint yeast/white bread notes, quickly goes into some maltiness and hop bitterness in the middle. The finish is a little wet. I really enjoyed the body of this beer. Good sting carbonation that pricks your pallet with a fantastic creamy texture as it goes down. Very nice medium body. As you drink, the hops and ethyl acetate build up on your pallet, rendering your taste buds useless.

32 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, coded ""JUL0317..."" and sample on 2 October 2017
$2.76 @ New Stop Discount Liquor Outlet, Camden, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: Risking life and limb in Camden, NJ (currently #10 in the country for murders) I picked up a 32 oz. bottle of Schlitz Malt Liquor. It wasn't until after I left that I realized I'd screwed up. I thought to myself, ""Damn, you was supposed to get a 40!"". Oh well. It's got a fingerprint-through-the-glass clarity in a light straw gold body beneath a foamy then creamy white head that holds surprisingly well and leaves some very nice lacing behind. What is going on? And there are also some hops found in the aroma - not just background hops, but clear hops along with sweetish golden malt. I must be having a very good ""nose day"" because I don't remember ever having a malt liquor that smelled of hops. I'd say they're floral and a bit herbal. There's also some fruit there as well, apple-like. Ahhh, and yes, that carries over into the flavor, there's a clear note of juicy red apple amidst the sweetish malt and hops. Keep in mind, these hops are not to the strength that most craft beer drinkers will think of, but they're there nonetheless. I was just about to say that there are also no off-notes, aromas or flavors due to a high fermentation but as I'm looking at the bottle I see that it's only 5.9% ABV - that explains a lot. Budweiser is currently 5.0% so it's not really that much higher. There's just a light hint of extra alcohol that actually works with the slight bit of extra malt. It's not bad, and in fact, it's pretty good - at least for a malt liquor. So let's sum up so far. It's got surprisingly good head retention and it leaves very nice lacing, and the aroma is nice. There's a hint of alcohol that I didn't find at first but it's not bad at all; and the flavor is very well balanced as well. Could it be a touch more bitter to balance the malt and give a drier finish? Perhaps, but this is a malt liquor which is supposed to be a little sweet. It's medium bodied and moderately crisp, which accentuates it's sweetish adjunct-laden golden maltiness but still it's smooth and quite nice - I'll give it a 3.5 as I think it could be a little crisper, but then again, I have to keep in mind that this is an American malt liquor and it's supposed to be more malty and smooth. Hmmm, I don't know, maybe it should get a 3.75 for being to style. So, the only thing left to judge it on is it's overall character, and in that regard I originally thought that it was one of the best malt liquors I'd ever tasted, and the fact that it had some hops and very nice lacing was a huge bonus.",3.5
Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),"Hard to drink an entire 40 compared to OE, my go-to. There is a faint sweetness that tastes artificial, like corn syrup.

Schlitz O.M.L. (Malt Liquor),A decent malt liquor. Bought at some hole in the wall liquor store near St. Louis on my way to Lake Timberline.

Carta Blanca,"Poured from a 32oz bottle best by Apr 2023

On the pour a 3 finger white head forms with some light fizziness. After a while the head dissipates to a more fizzy rocky 1 finger head. Fine plentiful carbonation in a golden yellow body. For the style head retention is pretty nice.

Aroma is old and almost skunky in the hops. Corn is present and lager character is quite present. A very ""mexican"" import aroma. Despite that it is full bodied while maintaining a lighter and refreshing presence. High carbonation while still being quite smooth and a nice dinner beer.

Overall this is pretty good, but there are a few off notes, traditional cervesa corny flavors and a bit of that corona like skunk, but a bit more rich and sweet than a lot of light Mexican beers.

Taste is light and ""cervesa"" like with the skunky off note gone on the palate almost entirely until there is a faint note of it on the very end. The main flavor of this is corny crackery malts with a slight sweetness. This beer is not very bitter but would be quite good on a beach with canitas tacos and lime.

Aroma: Light aromas. Some dry pale white cracker and bread dough. Some seawater. A touch of grass. Then some light fresh paint phenols from the yeast. (3.50)

Flavor: Light flavors of dry flaked biscuit and cracker. Some ground stone and mortar. Hints of grass. Some yeast allows it to finish very dry and clean. (4.00)

Feel: Medium to light bodied. Great carbonation and yeast. Very sudsy and clean. The carbonation and yeast clean the palate well to leave just enough sweetness on the palate. Well-constructed mouthfeel. Hits the mark for a lager. (4.00)

Compared with Warsteiner Pilsner: Similar appearance, a slightly sweeter aroma and flavor. Much more German biscuit and yeast. Less lemon and grass. A much more salty, sudsy, biscuit and yeast profile.

Compared with Peter's Brand: Similar flavor. More light yeast and stronger carbonation to provide a bump, rather than a twangy malt body.

Compared w/ Dos Equis 3/27/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. Less aromas. More dry ground flaked cracker and stone mortar. Less corn and sweetness. Overall, lighter, dryer, and more yeast.

Pours golden with a slim white head. Retention is fine. Decent amount of carbonation rising.

Aroma is unassuming.

The beer has a lot of carbonation and must be consumed cold.

It is the most refreshing beer I know. More exotic beers will cause bloat/tiredness after a couple but XXXX can be consumed in large quantities without taste or thirst fatigue.

Michelob (Original Lager),"Sampled multiple times from 1981 onwards. A typical commercial American pale lager, quite refreshing and better than it’s reputation, after all. Contains some rice. Tasted good in the heat of a Californian summer, but when I had it again in Norway, the magic was gone.",3.0
Michelob (Original Lager),"Pours a clear golden straw color. The head is two fingers high and white in shade; retention is pretty damn poor. The aroma offers a nice (yet subtle) hit of grassy hops, backed by the sweet malt backbone. Simple, yet effective. It seems to taste a little sweeter than the nose indicated, but only just a little bit. There's a touch of darker malt character to this beyond the classic white bread and cracker notes coming from pale malts; touches of toasted bread and nut comes through. The finish has enough hoppiness to cleanse the palate, no more and no less. It also seems to be a little buttery on the back end, maybe even a touch grainy. This is one of the few beers I've sampled that I can truly call bone dry. It manages this without being ridiculously over-carbonated. The dryness helps counteract the decently full body, though it does seem slightly astringent at times. Look, I know it's a 64, and that sucks. And while I definitely wanted a little more from this, it's not really BAD. It just isn't all that great. But hey, it's cheap, and better than Budweiser (and FAR better than Michelob Ultra). In the right place and right time, that's all that matters. There are other cheaper lagers I'd take over this, but it'll get the job done in a pinch.",3.0

Michelob (Original Lager),"Found some 6 packs of 12 oz bottles with twist offs
The pour revealed a crystal clear american lager whaddaya know. Head isnt all that fine and dissapeared as quick as it was poured. Visually cant differentiate between any other macros, except that its darker than light beers.

The smell has a strong corn aroma but hops do shine through unlike other macros which is a nice surprise. My sense of smell still isnt 100% here though. Almost smells like a grainy pils.

Flavor is even better than the smell. Bitterness from noble hops is obvious and appreciated with much of the grain covered by them while cold. Surprisingly dry for a macro full flavor. Quite nice for when you dont want something heavy but also not grossly sweet and grainy, but also dont want to shell out for a german import.

Feel is actually very refreshing the strong carbonation combines with the bitterness of the hops to create a refreshing experience with just enough grain sweetness to balance it out but not weigh it down.

Overall, one of the best cheap beers ice had, idk why irs rated so low here, for the style and brewery it's actually quite good. If you see it and havent tried it but like lagers, I'd pick it up, maybe if enough people buy it we can give it a new lease on life.",3.25
Michelob (Original Lager),"A vigorous pour produces a tightly packed white head that quickly recedes to nothingness, no lacing is left on the glass. Some bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass, but otherwise it looks like apple juice. The smell is of malts with some bittering hops. The taste is ok, there are no off flavors and the balance of malt and hops produces a decent bitterness that's correct for the style and the beer, but it's nothing special.

These reviews are just beer snobs and their bias against ""big beer"", especially Anheuser-Busch. I did a blind tasted test involving Michelob, Hofbrau, and some others pale lagers.

Keeps you drinking without thinking. Not impressed.",2.5
Boris (Le Flacon D'Alsace),"250ml bottle, quite reminiscent of Euro-Cokes, but un flacon? Je ne sais pas...

This beer pours a clear medium golden yellow hue, with one finger of weakly foamy, bubbly, and soapy dirty white head, which flees rather hastily, leaving some sparse blobs of cob-webbed lace around the glass.

It smells of semi-sweet cereal malt, a bit of wet cardboard, rice husks, a bit of astringent apple skin, and weedy, musty hay-like hops. The taste is lightly biscuity, bready malt, of the corn-fed variety, a sort of plastic, metallic character that I'm assuming comes from the underlying alcohol, and wet grassy, floral, weedy hops.

The carbonation is moderate, but also a wee bit sharp at times, the body medium-light in weight, and smooth enough, I suppose. It finishes with a weird warming sweetness, and a more than off-setting solvent stink, to no-one's surprise.

I couldn't sense much of a typical Euro-skank wafting from the glass, initially, but it slowly builds as things progress, the booze seeping in. Not a particularly pleasant experience, as the adequate graininess just gets lost in the musty mire.",2.5

T- Brewer's yeast all the way. Vitamin D pills. The brewer's yeast taste is definitely interesting yet borderline disgusting. I guess you could learn to appreciate it but I think the flavor should be finer or show more complexity to become interesting and ideally appreciated.

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"This is an odd one.
It tastes like a Belgian ale trying really, really hard to be an Imperial IPA- and not a great Belgian either, too thin to be a Belgian. Almost no bitterness. Not a lot of complexity in the flavors here. Could be improved by picking, once and for all, what this beer wants to do with its life, and then either adding citrus peel to make it more Belgiany or more hops to make it more Imperial. It does not taste double hopped, but it definitely hits like a double IPA at 8.4%, while also being five bucks a 6-pack at Trader Joe's... so, that does sway my review here. If it were any more expensive or tasted any worse, I'd say it's not worth it.

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"Overall; This beer reminds me a lot of Pyramid brewing's Outburst IPA. A dominating sweet malt bill. Nothing citrusy about the European type hops. Along with a high ABV. If you like Outburst you will like this beer. Very much a 90's type beer...

Pours a light orange/honey colored body with a white head. Not much retention. A few rings of speck lacing.

Nose is very understated. I'm getting sweet malt with a tiny whiff of German style hops.

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"Like others, 12oz can from Trader Joe's, dateless. Poured into rose glass.
L: Light brown, caramel color with a tall foamy not retentive white head. Not many bubbles present, they all shot to the top.
S: Caramelly, stale bread, and malty on the nose, a bit burnt, perhaps some nut or banana involved. The smells grows on me as I whiff.
T: Flat, stale holiday bread. More banana and burnt caramel. It tastes like it wants to be much more than it is, flavor uncomplex but not gross.
F: Oily and undeveloped, slips right off the tongue.
Overall, this beer I would not order, as there are more splendid alternatives, but if offered one I would not turn it down. The smell is the one redeeming quality here, otherwise it is a bit of a letdown.",2.75
Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"12oz can from joe's, no date

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"Bought it at Trader Joes. Thought maybe a bargain. No sir. Stuck with these and I down them only for the 8.5%, nothing like a IPA.

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"Found this at Trader Joe’s and thought 5 bucks for a 6 pack of double IPA? Why not? My first drink was my last drink, I’m not the type to pour a beer down the sink but with this one I had to. It does not taste like an IPA whatsoever. No hoppy taste or citrus taste or anything. Taste like a 20 dollar 6 pack of Beligian beer. So if you like Belgians you’ll like this but don’t expect an IPA flavor",1.0

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"As pretty much everyone has pointed out, this is not an IPA or anything even remotely resembling an IPA. If you were looking forward to drinking a nice double IPA with hops, citrus, bright but delcious biterness, etc, you will be very disappointed.

On the flip side, it's not THAT bad of a beer. Just close your eyes and pretend you are drinking an exotic, rare belgian beer that you paid $25 for, as opposed to some cheap TJ beer that sells for like $1 a can. If you are able to reframe your entire existence, including everything you have learned about this world up to this point, you may just fine this beer is enjoyable. Cheers.",2.75

Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"Ok,wasn't expecting much from my prior experiences with Minhas Brewery. Was pleasantly surprised,actually,as the Twin Screw really is a compliment to the brewery...The ABV of 8.4 made me think what I was getting was more like Malt Liquor and in ways I was right,but malt liquor that is far more refined than your average 40. I really like it and I won't apologize...it has some weirdness to it (not a bad thing) hops that seem distant and malt that seems slightly over-the-top but for 4.99..HEY! TJ's does it again...I will definitely keep it on my shopping list.3 of these and it's a party.LOL.",4.0
Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"whoever compared this to an imperial stout was correct in that some imperial stouts are balanced and not deeply colored. I could not call it a double ipa since it seems to have no relation to the current rage for dominant floral hops or unpleasant bitterness, which I would not call beer. this a very well-balanced ale with a wide range of hop and malt nose and tongue notes that evolve as the beer warms and releases various esters, phenolics, etc that can only come from an ale. drink this beer starting from ice-cold and make it last to room temp for a multidimensional experience. leave a very small amount in the glass and continue to sniff. those who rate it low must be unfamiliar with anything beyond overwhelming modern hop bombs. if you want mango, grapefruit, pine resin, citrus, etc, go elsewhere to the many ""craft"" ipas or fruit juices. I buy this frequently at Trader Joe's-the price is incredible compared to many of the beers available-and it is a great adjunct to my normal diet of expensive ""crankcase oil"" malty ales.",4.25
Boatswain Double IPA (Twin Screw Steamer),"I bought three of these at TJ's. The cash register person at TJ's said her boyfriend did not like this beer. I assumed I was not going to like it because I drink a lot of big name, little name, and everything in between IPA. I won't serve it to my IPA friends but will let them try it. It actually reminded my of Surly Furious (with a hint of Fat Tire). I had two of these and was done drinking beer for the night (weeknight). I think I will buy a few more and see if it is consistent with the first few I bought. $.84 for a DIPA? I have spent a lot more for a lot less.",3.75

Miller High Life,"Every six months I purchase a 40 oz. bottle of this beer hoping that maybe my taste buds were having a ""bad day"" the last time I drank it. I really want to like the High Life but just can't get past the greasy vegetable oil aftertaste finish this beer gives. Maybe its the Galena hops that they use. I tried to find other beers that use these hops but have had no such luck. Molson Coors has retired very drinkable & palate pleasing lagers such as Extra Gold & even Milwaukee's Best Premium. Hamm's and Banquet are the two most enjoyable AAL's that this brewery brews. Not being a ""hater"" I will buy and drink a 40 of MLH in hopes I will see and taste
something different.",2.75
Miller High Life,"Acquired as part of a trade/proxy with @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022.

As with all Miller beers, this one looks gorgeous in the glass. It's a crystal clear yellow with a bright white head and bubbles racing up the middle of the glass. It leaves nice lacing on the way down. This is how my old man's beers looked when I was growing up in the 80s. But as with my old man's beers, once you go from eye to mouth, things start going downhill.

On the nose, there's a corny sweetness. It's not appealing in an age of tropical fruit bombs or rich, roasty stouts. There's no hop presence and in fact very little aroma at all. This won't scare off the beer's intended audience, though.

Taste is a letdown even after the nose. There's a minerally, soda water vibe going on. There's some sweet malt, but it's like the beer is produced with postmix and even then the beer syrup in the packet is on its last legs. There is utterly no hop body. The beer has some bitterness, so there are clearly hops in the beer, but maybe they were only waved in the general direction of the boil, rather than actually inserted.

Feel is ok. The carbonation comes through more strongly than I would have expected and it definitely overshadows what taste there is, so the sensation on the swallow again brings to mind carbonated postmix. I've seen a few reviews that point to the beer's excellent softness and generous mouthfeel, but I just don't get it.

I specifically requested some American macros in the trade/proxy that this beer came in, and I'm glad I did, and I will again. Even living in Australia I'm aware of the iconic nature of this beer and its tagline. I'm also aware that it no longer lives up to what a craft beer drinker wants in a beer, but then nor is it meant to. There's an audience for this beer, and it's not a craft beer drinker, but it is a craft beer collector who wants to experience the full gamut of the world's beers, and I'm very much in that camp. It's near impossible to get it through normal channels and I'm glad I went to the effort to get this one. I've loved receiving, pouring and drinking this beer, even though as far as beer goes, it's pretty ordinary. It'll get marked up a little in the overall mark because ultimately it's my overall experience I'm rating here, and in those terms it didn't disappoint at all.

Cheers!",3.5
Miller High Life,"Poured into a beer mug and it was a really clear light golden color with a thick white head. Could not really smell much of anything in the glass. Decent taste and a good thirst quencher, especially on a day after working in the yard or around the house.",3.0
Miller High Life,The marketing of this beer promises a high quality experience but it is swill not much different than the regular Miller.,2.5
Miller High Life,Looks good smell is not offensive but sweet. Taste has a strong malt sweetness . Very distance hop flavor like all the way at the end of the street. Mouth feel is extremely smooth. I have drank like 200ish bottles in order to make the review and it is a great beer for the price been buying it for 12 pack bottles for $6.50,4.0
Miller High Life,"Poured from a 7oz pony bottle into a rocks glass.

On the pour not a lot of head forms because there is so little liquid and I was a bit too gentle. Over a couple minute the head actually grows from the streams of carbonation rocking up the sides of the glass. Body is a light golden color just a touch darker than straw, leaves light lacing. Good looking beer.

Aroma is grainy with some skunked hops present. This is likely less present in the canned version, but the clear bottles will definitely be skunky. The skunk isn't overwhelming but present and verging on bad. The maltiness of this beer isn't completely covered however. Some corny vibes but it doesn't smell watered down.

Flavor follows the aroma and loses a bit of the skunk amd trades it for a sweet grainy crisp flavor. Some cheapness does come through but miller makes some pretty good cheap beer. The flavor profile is pretty soft and bready with some very very light notes of the hops on the very back end, however they do still provide some bitterness.

Feel is where miller shines the brightest. On the sip isn't feels big while still being refreshing and not too heavy in the stomach. Big carbonation on this one, but it's fine carbonation giving this one decent body.

Overall I think miller makes one of the best American mass market lagers out there, and so far they haven't let me down. Sweet without being too syrupy and bringing the malt flavor that not hoppy beer should have. Refreshing and not too many off flavors like some AALs.",3.25

Miller High Life,Most all domestic beer seems to be a disappointment nowadays..Most beer drinkers think that it used to be of much better quality.

Few years back they improved it with newer type shelf stable yeasts and the quality has actually came back and it's not too bad compared to the other domestic beers out there. With that said I still miss the quality that all domestic U S beer used to have and now lacks.The big breweries think beer drinkers are uneducated slobs and will drink anything because they can't tell the difference.,2.75

Angkor Beer,"12 oz slim can traded from brutal farce poured into 16 oz Budweiser pint glass.

Clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head of 2 fingers. It gradually diminishes to a sliver, no lacing.

Aroma is husky and grainy, slight sweet apple fruit, almost cider-y. Faint maize.

Flavor is crisp and clean with a nice rice/plant/barley flavor. Not much for lingering flavor except a slight champagne dryness and lingering pear and apple fruits. Corn creaminess as well.

Feel is crisp and clean with only mild starches on the finish. Very good carbonation.

Overall, a poor rating is not warranted, simply because a lager is not going to give the flavors that other more eccentric styles will. This is a cut and dry enjoyable, quenchable, by-the-book lager that stands with the rest. Fear not, take the dive, you won't lose beer karma if you drink it.",3.5

Angkor Beer,"Poured into a small pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of grainy malt, lemon and grassy hops. Flavor is mild grainy, slightly sweet malt, grassy hops, thinning out and getting astringent in the finish. Light to medium bodied with sharp carbonation. On the grainy side of the adjunct lager spectrum, but the malt pretty much dies out half way through the taste, leaving the somewhat astringent (possibly just old) hops stark on the tongue. The neutral malt sweetness that usually make this style inoffensive is not present here, this just tastes like a watered down lager. I liked their stout and decided to give this a shot, but although I might welcome this on a hot Cambodian afternoon, it's not worth revisiting outside its country of origin. Drinkable, but mediocre.",3.0

Kirin Ichiban,"Tall can of Kirin Ichiban, billed as first press 100% Malt, pours a crystal clear, light straw gold with two fingers of foamy head. The head has… surprising staying power? Or maybe not? If I was more objective I wouldn’t be so surprised, expecting a macro to be as bad as the Labatts and Coors of the world. This looks objectively great. Straightforward and crispy lager aromas of strong cereal grains and toasted malt. Slightly grassy background. Classic and straightforward.

Unfortunately, the palate falls short of the appearance and aroma, which are both straightforward but very nice. Not that the taste is bad per se. The malt is more gentle, but the grainy taste of a lager is here. Slightly bready in character, slightly grassy with the mildest of bitterness, the taste is washed away by a slight watery sensation. Light bodied as can be expected with medium carbonation that can only be described as crisp, there is a nice prickliness on the tongue that quickly washes the beer down on each sip with a very snappy character. The only thing left each time is a very, very mild biscuity, gently malty bread finish.

Objectively, if you’re honest with yourself on the feel and look of the beer (and the taste being thoroughly average) each rating would absolutely clock way above the Avg on BA. Hard to see people here rank it so low on looks when lagers and pils from Anchor, Founders, or Deschutes breweries are given almost perfect marks despite looking nigh identical. The beer is thoroughly unremarkable in the taste department but by no means *bad*. If anything, this beer clocks above most macros simply by way of avoiding the completely washed out corn adjunct taste of most macro beers, and avoids the metallic tinge common to all too many canned macros.

Would I go out of my way to have this again? Unlikely. Did I enjoy it more than most macros? Absolutely. Is it bad tasting? Not at all. Most Asian-themed, Chinese, and Japanese restaurants tend to have limited selection on tap, so is this something I’d order over other ones there? Probably yes!

When people say ‘hey the beer snobs hate macros but I love my crisp and clean beer!’ THIS is the taste I always imagined. Bud, Coors, Labatt, Busch, all are unsavoury in some ways, some metallic, some unfortunate corn-y tastes. Kirin Ichiban surprisingly outpaces all of those beers.

Important Identifiers: Kirin Ichiban First Press 100% Malt, poured from a 473mL can. No canning date, but drank from a large shipment from the LCBO, likely fairly fresh. Can bottled and brewed under license by the Labatt brewery in Canada, rather than the Japanese brewery.",3.0
Kirin Ichiban,"Despite copping backlash for being ""yet another generic mainstream lager"", this beer actually carries itself well. Yes, there's some corn and a bit of grass, but it's moderately hopped, crisp and generally well put together, which is exactly what this beer should be.

In the glass, it pours a shining golden yellow. The Head quickly disappears and carbonation is not exactly jumping out of the glass.

Aroma-wise there's not much there. Perhaps some crackers and bread and the faintest floral hoppy note.

Taste-wise it's dry, moderately bitter and carries unmistakable biscuit with some corn and grass, but none of the offensive blandness that can characterise some generic international lagers. For mine, it's the moderate floral hoppiness that carries this beer, and it does so in a way that doesn't unbalance the beer given the relatively light body.

Mouthfeel is dominated by significantly more prickly carbonation than is evident from sight, but it's not an unpleasant or overbearing sensation.

Overall, this beer is what it should be. It's meant for consumption without significant contemplation, and its dryness and relatively neutral taste profile means it would suit most foods. If you expect a hoppy, fruity craft lager, you'll be disappointed. if you expect a reasonably generic international lager boosted by a moderate but not overbearing bitterness, which is what this beer is, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Old German,"Picked this up from the cheap foods rainbow foods outlet. Big 24 oz can I think.

Pours looking like your standard adjunct lager, straw yellow, fizzy white head 2/5"". Aroma was corn and lager yeast. Little bit of those hydraulic fluid feels that adjunct lagers can get.

Taste, you can tell after the massive carbonation push, is mostly corn, grain and bittering hops to a lesser degree. Its light bodied enough. I dig the German guy on the logo though, I'm sure there is somehow some purple hair gape mouth selfie taker who finds it problematic. Kind of makes me think of this as more of a session like Country Club (malt liquor). Its not ever going to be a go to beer, but sure man, 100 degree weather, I'd crush one of these again in between other beers as a palate cleanser if you will.

Old German,"I found this beer at my local distributor, 15 pack for $9.99. The marketing is nothing special, it's a silly german caricature with a red banner.

Let's be real, this is not gourmet beer, it's a cheap (really cheap) lager you get when you want a buzz without spending more than your spare change. For that class of beer, Old German is actually great. I wasn't expecting much for taste, but it has a decent carbonated hoppy flavor that beats anything Coors or Miller Lite. Personally, I love carbonated beer, so I may have a positive bias for the taste. I will say, though, this beer needs to be ice cold to enjoy. It's not a Bavarian import that tastes good warm, no sir. Put it in the cooler.

The best aspect of this beer, is that it isn't a headache in a can like natural ice or other dirt cheap beers out there. What I'm saying, is that it won't punish you the next day, so long as you don't go overboard.

Old German,"Old German pours exactly as you'd expect it to, yet even lighter. About as straw yellow as an AAL could be, with champagne bubbles and even a white champagne like head that bursts up, then falls back down. Light surface coverage, even lighter lacing.

An extra dose of skunk from the hops come along with bland cracked grain, honey and corn syrup. Not asking for an Oscar, that's obvious.

I didn't think it was possible, but it's even lighter than it looks. Carbonated water with just mentions of those aromas listed above transcending into the flavor.

Exceptionally light and dry, yet balanced. Leaves you kind of smacking your tongue to the roof of your mouth between sips. Did I mention it's dry?

Clean but somehow not crisp. There's a light lemony note that I wasn't expecting. To be honest, warmth wasn't a friend of this brew. It has a light soapy note to it which oddly didn't kill the beer for me. Unfortunately it took over the brew later into the taste.

Hoegaarden Citron,"12oz Bottle

Appearance - Pours a cloudy yellow colour with a massive foamy/fizzy white head. I can't see much carbonation, and there seems to be some pretty decent lacing. The head lasted for 5 minutes or so.

Smell - lemons, sugar, wheat

Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and the beer has a very sugary sweet and slightly bitter lemon taste. I'm not really sure that this qualifies as a beer - seems more like a lemon soda. There is a hint of wheat but the flavour is basically all lemons and sugar.

Overall - It's not horrible.. I've had some other fruit beers that were just way too sweet, this one at least has a little bit of balance. I would never have purchased this beer but it was a gift. I wouldn't have it again.",2.5

A Soft, fluffy white head reminds me of whipped egg over a lemonade, slightly cloudy body. I like this look.

S Lemon lime, inviting, refreshing. It is certainly different as far as the smell, from other beers. The lemon lime crossed over a bit into a mediciny smell (alka-seltzer?) which I did not like so much.

T Ya know, like a Hoegaarden with lemon lime flavoring. I don't mean to be trite but it tastes exactly like I thought it would in that way. I think that Hoegaarden (the original) is an excellent starting point for a flavored beer and this beer shows that to be the case. The lemon lime did get to be a bit too much as I sipped on, edging into an unwelcome mediciny taste (again, alka-seltzer?)

I finally tried the ginger version of this. It has a light tan, ginger ale color to it. Some foam forms but it fizzes instantly away like soda. The aroma is sugary sweet and gingery, with a mouthfeel much like ginger ale. The flavor is sweet and gingery. It isn't as intense as a ginger beer, but still has a tiny bit more burn than a ginger ale. The aftertaste has some ginger flavor lingering along with some bready notes (the only beer-llike characteristic I detected. No alcoholic warmth to finish it out.

Carib Ginger Shandy,"330ml single bottle, procured at my favorite down-market 'bottleshop' in E-town.

This 'beer' pours a clear, pale golden amber colour, with one (I think) finger of fizzy soda-pop 'head', which predictably wisps away just as fast as you can look at it, leaving nothing resembling lace near the glass.

It smells of sharp, edgy, and duly spicy ginger root, middling caramel notes, and a gritty sugarcane sweetness. The taste is much more of the same - rather sweet, syrupy sugar, tinted with a burnt caramel/toffee essence, still perky and peppy natural spicy ginger, an echo of actual indistinct malt, and a mild herbal astringency, very much like those Caribbean bitters.

The bubbles are barely adequate, more like the kind that remain in a bottle of cola left in the fridge for three days, the body a deceptive medium weight, as all that extra sugar has to go somewhere. It finishes well, sweet, in a rather saccharine sense, the ginger holding on, much as it would in the associated soft drink.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is sweet like soda, low alcohol, and yet pretty gingery. This all may be a bit confusing, but I'd take this in a heartbeat over any actual 'ginger ale', as all other things being equal, the minor ABV and heady ginger root notes make this a winner. A winner for Canadian grocery stores, that is, and not as a 'lager beer', as they've so brazenly plastered on the label.",2.0

Pours the color of ginger ale with a soda pop white head that dissipates to nothing immediately. Bubbles can be seen effervescing.

Smells strongly of spicy ginger and sugar cane sweetness, with maybe a hint of apple juice.

Tastes like ginger beer (ginger ale that has the sting from the ginger) with only the faintest whisper of beer malts at the very end. Sugary sweet.

Feels medium thick, sticky and very bubbly.

Carib Ginger Shandy,"I found this single, clear, 12oz bottle at the Binny's store in Plainfield, IL for $1.99. There are a couple different flavors of Carib Shandy - this is the ginger version. The label says it is a blend of lager beer with natural ginger flavor and caramel color.

The beer poured a crystal clear pale gold color with lots of carbonation bubbles, but it only made a thin white rim for a head that completely disappeared within 20 seconds and left no lacing.

The only smell this beer gives off is that of the ginger plant. No beer smell to it at all.

This tastes like ginger ale. No hint of hops or malts or any trace of the lager beer that the label claims is in here. It's a very sweet ginger ale soda. It doesn't taste terrible for a ginger ale, but as a beer it's not very good.

Medium body with a just less than heavy soda-like carbonation.

At 1.2% abv you can drink a ton of these before feeling anything, but it's really too sweet to enjoy more than 1 or 2. People who don't like beer might like this, but if you're a serious beer drinker you'll pass on this one.",1.5

Pours same light brown/caramel that is visible through the clear glass bottle. Some loud fizz of a head immediately disappears. No lacing.

The smell is of arificial sweetener with ginger. Smells like sweetened tonic water with ginger-flavoring.

The taste is sickly sweet - sugar sweetness as in the ""malt beverages"" way. Ginger flavor is there, but not in much of a spicy way, so it adds flavor, but not much balance to the sweetness. Sweetness lingers.

Light-bodied, a bit sticky. Not too fizzy for what it could be.

Drinkable to a point if you waant a sweet ginger flavored drink that has little to no resemblance to beer. Other than carbonation, where is the ""lager"" part of this?

The beer is a true 'ginger' ale. There are really no characteristics in the taste, nose, appearance, or texture that resemble beer. But that doesn't keep this concoction from becomming a complete disaster.

The ginger, sugary sensation hits up front in the nose and holds on to all the senses from there on out. No hops, no malt, no real estery profiles, phenols... nothing. Just ginger all the way.

Still pleasant, refreshing, and crisp- even if in a soda-pop kinda way. This beverage is unique enough to put into it's own beverage genre like the ciders, pere, and meads do.

It tasted like seagrems gingerale. Soo sugary sweet that I could not even find anything else in it to describe. Very light bodied with huge carbonation, these were probably the only only redeeming factors. But still the taste was so off setting that it still was not even remotely drinkable.

I'm not saying that this is a great beer, but for what it is, it actually came as a pretty positive surprise to me.

Tiger Beer,"Tiger Asian Lager is crystal clear and pale amber in color, pretty much the color of ripe hay. The head is rocky, bone white, and surprisingly lasting for the style.
At first blush, Tiger's aroma is sweet and appropriately malty for a pale lager. Meaning it's pale grains combined with crackers and a general sort of breadiness. There's also an up front sweetness that at first seems generic in its sugariness. Then, the center comes along and confirms the presence of corn adjuncts. The sweetness literally reminds me of corn syrup. The finish is also short and sweet, fading quickly into nothing.
My first impression is of a beer that is smooth and rounded, but that impression doesn't last long. It quickly becomes sweet with flavors of corn syrup that thankfully stops short of being cloying. There may be a hint of soda cracker in there, but the corn adjuncts make it hard to pick out. As with the aroma, the flavor ends on a sweet note.
It could be a half decent lager but the corn adjuncts dominate too much to the beer's detriment. If it even had some dryness in its flavor profile that would help cut the beer's overall sweetness. But sadly, no such luck.",2.5

Tiger Beer,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has an amazing level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is a mix of mustiness, graininess and some sweeter caramel. Along with these smells comes a little bit of a light peach and apricot sweetness.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweeter caramel and an almost candy corn like sweetness with some lighter bready flavors. These tastes create the bulk flavor of the brew and remain rather strong throughout. The sweetness does transition a bit however, gaining some more honey and candy corn like flavors at the expense of the caramel. All the while, there is a touch of herbal hop and a small transitioning of the bready to a more doughy taste, leaving one with a sweeter, but pleasant and still crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium to slightly lighter with a carbonation level that is rather average. While a bit more carbonation may have been slightly more fitting for the sweeter tastes, the medium body and feel is great for the flavor profile, and makes for one nice easy drinker.
Overall – A brew fit for a nice hot summer day. Easy drinking, slightly sweeter, and still rather refreshing. Nice overall.",3.5

Laker Ice Premium Lager,"Does the job... Honestly, this is a mass produced lager, it honestly isn't that bed, it isn't that great, it is a go to beer when you want something that honestly doesn't make you think more then you just want another beer... Apparently I need to say more and more and more and more, I have nothing more to say so I am blah blah blahing right now, is this enough word to describe a run of the mill ice lager??!",2.75
Laker Ice Premium Lager,"Tallboy can from TBS; packaged in August 2012. Lucky review #7 in a series detailing various widely-available pale lagers that I've neglected to review or even try for one reason or another. I am always a little hesitant to pick up any beer whose name ends with ""ice"", but for the benefit of consumer knowledge I am willing to risk life, limb, and perhaps even liver. There's no claim on the label of this being ""premium"" (or even a lager) anymore - I can only assume that even the marketing department had trouble convincing themselves it was a legitimate use of the term.

Pours a deep golden-yellow colour, generating nearly two finger's worth of fizzy, frothy white head. I am, of course, not surprised to see it fizzle away before my very eyes, but at least it manages to leave behind a soapy ring around the edge, and a thin cap at the surface rather than evaporating totally. Decidedly unpleasant aroma, even for the style - lots of corn syrup sweetness, grainy malts, and a whiff of solvent.

Unfortunately, the flavour isn't all that appealing either, with the solvent/fusel notes from the nose being even more prominent here. Corny sweetness, pale malts and wet cardboard are the more tolerable tastes near the start of the sip, but these lead into considerably more vegetal, syrupy and boozy notes toward the finish. Sweet aftertaste; pretty boozy for something of 5.5% - that's not enough for the beer to taste hot or anything, but the total vacuum of other prominent flavours in the profile allows the ethanol to blunt-force its way through. Light-bodied and watery, with relatively high carbonation - although honestly, I would prefer it a little higher, to help scrub away the off-flavours. Not very difficult to consume quickly, and I reckon you probably should, because this is not the kind of beer that improves as it warms.

Final Grade: 2.4, a D+. Laker Ice is OK by 'ice beer' standards, but disappointing by adjunct lager standards (as low of a bar as that is). I'd probably take this over Carling Ice, Old Milwaukee Ice or Labatt Maximum... but if I'm setting the bar that low in the first place, I'd rather have a regular adjunct lager. Regular Laker might not be a very good lager, but its big brother here is straddling the line between tolerable and unappealing.

I'm honestly surprised at how much of a difference 0.5% abv can make - I have no real problem with standard Laker or Carling; cheap and bland as they are, they are fairly inoffensive. But that extra 0.5 is enough to transform them into beers that approach drain-pouringly bad levels of lameness. If you absolutely need to find a pale lager at 5.5%, I still say James Ready is about the 'best' you can hope for in this price bracket, forget about all this iced garbage.",2.5
Laker Ice Premium Lager,"I usually pick up a ""Laker"" beer and expect nothing, but I was actually really impressed with Laker Ice.

It has a nice golden colour and a very sweet smell. I was most impressed with the taste. It was very smooth and thin tasting, and had a very high quality taste that could compare to the top tier Ice Lagers. There was no after taste and paired very nicely with nachos.

It smelt bland and there was nothing overly special about the taste. I would like the taste to be a bit more complex, but it makes for a very fast drinking beer.",3.0
Laker Ice Premium Lager,"473ml Can

Appearance – Clear yellow colour with an average size fizzy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for around 4 minutes before it was gone.

Smell - Grains, bread, corn, malts

Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation. I can taste malts, grains, and lots of corn. There is also a bit of a floral taste and also an unidentifiable cooked vegetable flavour. It ends with a grainy yet sweet aftertaste.

Overall – To be honest it was really much better than I was expecting. There was a bit of an odd taste to it, but it was in no way undrinkable. Not something I'd buy again, but it went down fast after my hockey game.",2.5

Much darker in color than a normal euro lager, its color reminded me of peach juice, but with the same clarity you would expect from a lager. Pretty high carbonation can not hide the increased ABV, that feels rather unnatural.
Smell is full of alcohol and faint spices, some fruit too.
Taste is very blunt, some alcohol traces, just your extremely average lager. However, the black can has a lovely design. Anyway, compared to a bottle of Chisinau beer, this one is nowhere near it.

Sweet and syrupy from the moment the can was opened, it was the sweetest by far of the high alcohol cans we tried.

"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4","Got this from a supermarket in Normandy. Says it's a beer ""rich in ingredients"" with a ""long brewing process...""

From a 50cl can into a pint glass.
ABV: 8%

APPEARANCE: Pours a three finger, medium looking, fluffy white head with decent retention. Perfectly clear amber orange with medium carbonation. Force carbonated. Fades to a chunky wisp and leaves foamy, chunky wisp on the sides of the glass. Splotchy wisp leaves some lacing down the glass.

SMELL: Mild nose of bread and grain. Light caramel perhaps.

TASTE: Bread and grainy malts to begin, with some sweet grainy malt, some light caramel and some bitter hop at the swallow. Aftertaste is sweet and grainy with caramel and toffee sweetness and just a hint of bitterness. Much like the Admiral but without the hop balance.

PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. A little light, goes down fine and finishes slightly sweet on palate. A touch light perhaps.

OVERALL: Not as good as their Admiral. Stronger with more sweet malt flavors, but without the hop bitterness to act as balance. Yeah, there's a lot of flavor, but not flavor that make me want to go back for more.",2.5
"Amsterdam Navigator 8,4","We pop the tab and glug out an apple juice colored brew. It puts up a one and a half finger chunky white head showing great retention. This leaves a single thick sheet of lacing as it dissipates. Carbonation appears average, with no haze or sediment noted. The nose is full of adjuncts, flour, biting alcohol, syrupy sugar, and a light nectary hop. Raw vanilla bean, grassy leafiness, and lactics appear on the far back with warmth. Our first impression is that this beer is extraordinarily sweet. The taste opens with cloying sugars hitting hard and hitting fast. It is dextrin and candy-like, with a bit of apple sweetness. It is hard to pick out any other flavoring until the middle, where a floury malt comes in, but this does little to cut the sugars. The end shows more cheap apple quality, but the grain is most apparent here, with adjuncts, bitters, and a big dose of booze. The aftertaste breathes of raw cane sugary, fermented apples, fusel alcohols, and some wheaty wetness. The body is thick, and the carbonation is light to medium. Each sip is puckering to the sweetness, but there is decent sip and froth, and hearty slurp and glug. The abv is appropriate, and the beer is hard to drink.

Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the appearance. The head actually showed nice retention and color, making the beer seem rather inviting. It really fell apart from there, as the flavoring was intensely sweet. There was actually a benefit to this in that it helped to mask the alcohol pretty well. Other than that it decimated all other traces of flavoring and overwhelmed the drinker.",2.5

Taste: very very sweet, almost like strong liquor (e.g. liquor 43) with malts . Some hints of caramel and a very weak grainy hoppiness in the aftertaste. The beer tastes like sugar is added after the brewing process. Alcohol is quite strong.

Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,"Poured from an undated 24oz can. Also does anybody actually know who owns this brand?

On the pour a quite surprising 4 finger, albiet quite fizzy, white head that dissipates down to 2 fingers after a couple minutes. Color is your standard golden yellow straw, and carbonation is fine but active. Some lacing

Smell is generically cheap. Light and dominated by mistreated lager yeast. Not the most disgusting thing, and honestly quite bright smelling, but still not good by any means.

Taste is syrupy and odd. Diacetyl is present and the ""malt"" is intensely sweet and syrupy. There is some actual barley present but it's hiding in the very back. Slightly Metallic as well.

Feel is mouth coating and weirdly flat. Maybe this is an old can but there is still carbonation. Maybe the liquid just chemically couldn't hold carbonation well. Medium long finish that I wish was shorter.

This is a disgrace to market as a pilsner. Once G. Heileman moved out of La Crosse and City Brewing took over just figuring out who owns what, and even what beer comes out of that brewery is a nightmare. About the only good City brewing beer I've had was montucky cold snacks and that was just a decent lager. This on the other hand is a cheap disgrace. I'd rather drink colt 45.

Lost Lake Naturally Brewed Pilsner,"$4.49 USD plus tax per sixer of 12 fl oz pull-tab cans at a shitty liquor store (Poindexter Liquor) in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.

""Naturally brewed pilsner beer.""

Off the first sip, I'm calling bullshit on the ""pilsner"" designation. This is very clearly an adjunct lager...it's immediately obvious.

A biteen syrupy. Driven by a deeply off-putting creamed corn sweetness. Cheap 6-row lends more generic malt sweetness.

A bit metallic. Certainly too sweet. Lacks any balancing hop character.

I won't get into its lack of any Noble hop character or pilsner malt since it'd be disingenuous...it ain't a pilsner, it's a budget adjunct lager.

But even as a budget adjunct lager it's pretty bad, to be honest. I often find myself defending the Coors Banquets and Miller High Lifes of the world, but I can offer no such effort with respect to this...it's bad and generic, with obvious imbalance and no redeeming characteristics.

Even on a budget beer basis, it comes up short against Ballantine XXX, the less repungant malt liquors, and many mainstream adjunct lagers (Schlitz Gusto, Coors Banquet, Rolling Rock, Miller High Life, hell even Budweiser - yes, I said it).

This is in that weird market segment of budget lagers brewed by generic sounding corporate conglomerates by shell companies in Wisconsin (this one is ""brewed"" by ""Universal Sales, Inc., La Crosse, WI"" - I'm sure that's a down-home operation run by passionate former homebrewers...), and even in that unenviable cohort it's a loser of a beer.

Smell - Trying to be a little objective here. Smells sweeter than I'd like, lots of mixed in adjunct aromas. A little bit of malt.

Taste - Not the worst beer I've ever had, but definitely on the low end. It tastes kinda like an anxiety attack... Ok, it's not that bad.

Boatswain American IPA,"12oz can no date, just a stupid code

Hard pour, big foam, amber-orange and clear, some very pretty lacing left on the glass. Smells like rust water and alcohol. Tastes like heavy malts and aromatic bittering hops. Pine is the defining hop characteristic, but there's not a ton of it, this is mostly a malt bomb apart from the bitterness

This isn't for the west-coast hop heads - more of an old-head classic representative of the style. And at $5 a sixer, how can you even begin to be critical?!",4.0

Boatswain American IPA,"They're calling this an American IPA and not a Northwest / West Coast or New England IPA, and selling a pack of six for a measly 5 bucks... so maybe I can forgive the disappointing lack of hops in both smell and taste.

What I can't forgive is the awful nose and the very off-putting after-taste that accompanies this beer. This is one of the worst and weirdest IPAs I've ever tried. It's overly malty for an IPA, too sweet, unpleasantly sour, and the after taste is aptly described by other reviewers as ""medicinal.""

The high alcohol content may have some medicinal effects, but that's about it. This is the first TJ's beer I've tried and I may not be trying many more after this one.",2.0

Boatswain American IPA,"355ml Can from California as a gift:
Dark, caramel amber with a clear body & a 0.5cm, foamy & off-white head with some lacing. The nose is strong but not overly hoppy, some caramel sweetness & biscuit malts helping with the balance then some citrus following on behind. The taste is a little unbalanced with a few malts & bitter hops again then an unusual sweetness that didn't really work well. The beer is well-carbonated & sharp but it was definitely missing something too.",3.25
Boatswain American IPA,"Not good. Definitely not an IPA. Found this one at Trader Joe’s. No date on can. Started off OK, nice amber honeyed color with a little fluffy white head and very minimal spotty lacing. Smell was all wrong though - Belgian yeast, clove, wheat, heavy malt, raisin. No hops or anything even close to it. Tastes similarly, just heavy on the malt and yeast. Where’s the hoppiness? Thin mouthfeel and only decent carbonation. I felt very misled by the label on this beer.",2.25
Boatswain American IPA,"This has a nice bronze color, but very little head or lacing. It smells too strong, sort of bitter medicine and yeast. It tastes a little better than it smells, with a strange malt and yeasty hops mix. The mouth feel is ok - smooth with a little burst of carbonation. My second of these, poured in a glass was better than the first straight from the can, but it is still probably my least favorite IPA ever tried. Pass on this.",2.5
Boatswain American IPA,"Appearance: Pours a deep amber orange color with a mild white head. SRM of 14 (3.75)

Aroma: Strong orange and medicine aromas. Lots of clove, medicinal aspirin as I have gotten with all of Minhas beers. It's just orange tangerine and aspirin. (3.00)

Flavor: Flavor follows the nose with even more clove and drying medicinal flavors. Resembles Belgian yeast. Orange upfront, but then get walloped up by the medicinal quality. Finishes dry, medicinal, and bitter. (2.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Thick and low carbonation. Leaves a medicinal and spice bitterness on the palate. Not very pleasant. (2.00)

Overall: Good God this is a terrible beer. Definitely should not be called an ""IPA"". All of the beers from this brewery have this orange, medicinal quality and taste the same. This one is just stronger. Not a pleasant flavor. The appearance is the only redeeming quality of this beer. A beer that's ranked #6836 of the American IPA category should not be called an IPA. I think I could stir some hops and malts together and put it in a microwave and get a better product than this. (Final Rating: 2.15)",1.0
Boatswain American IPA,"Clear amber with thin head. Smells of sweet crackery malt with hint of spicy hops. Flavor is similar, kind of toasty. Definitely more malt forward than hop forward. I can't rate this as an AIPA, as it doesn't fit the profile at all. It's more like an english bitter. The bitterness is a strong component of the experience, yet still not very bitter for an IPA.

It's quite inexpensive. It's a clear, honey color, with above-average carbonation which causes tiny bubbles to rise continuously from the bottom of the glass. Unremarkable head.

It smells grainy. The taste is so-so, a bit below average. It's fairly bitter due to its hop content, but it also has a prominent woody malt character which doesn't taste fresh to me. A hint of a chemical or plastic taste, bordering on rancid. Compared to the IPAs I imbibe regularly, it's subpar.",2.75

Oculto,"So refreshing, I love this beer",5.0
Oculto,I don't know why so many people are leaving horrible reviews. I absolutely loved this beer and think it was genius to brew in tequila barrels. Abita brew does the same only with bourbon barrels and those fly off the shelves. Perhaps it's a cultural thing as most of the people I know who loved it as much as I do were Latinos. I wish it wasn't taken off shelves and Anheuser-Busch would consider putting them back-at least in the high Latino community stores.,5.0
Oculto,Not a bad hybrid beer for what it is. Not a craft effort. It reminds me of Corona. I taste a little Tequila flavor. Good beer for a summer day.

Oculto,Tastes like tequila water,2.0
Oculto,"REALLY wanted to love this. Bottle art kicks ass, but that was where my love affair ended. Smells sweet with notes of lime, sweetness that I think must be the infusion of blue agave that the label states. The colder the better, as it kills the sweetness. Did not detect any tequila, which was another disappointment because the label hinted otherwise. Would be a good beer for people who aren't beer fans. A nice halfway point between beer and wine coolers. Will probably try again though, might be a better summer beer.",1.75
Oculto,"Basically it's a great beer for starting a day out in the summer sun. You don't want to drink too much of it, and the first few sips are very refreshing. Outside of that it's not a beer you want too much of. It's not bad. Just specific.

Look: Very nice clear golden color. But not much head for a 6% lager. It could be that my bottle is a few months old so I will give that a pass.
Smell: Sweet, and sort of smoky
Taste: Sweet at first but then gets a little strangely smoky, sweet and tangy. The taste itself is fine but the aftertaste lingers for a while and is not the most pleasant.
Feel: nice and crisp mouthfeel. Might be a bit bubbly for some but I enjoy it.",3.5

Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,"Regardless of the name on the label, virtually all of Sleeman's core brands look the same. Silver Creek Lager is no different: light yellow in colour, with an antiseptically clean complexion, and bubbles so plentiful yet entirely ineffective that they must be artificial (they can't sustain a proper head).

There's a certain characteristic that from day one I've noted in all Sleeman products; it's especially prominent in the aroma. It's been many years since I've last had an offering of theirs but I still feel confident I could pick them out in a lineup with other mass-produced domestic brand lagers.

Now I realize it must be the brand of corn syrup they use. This sweet, stenchy, skunky note has an industrial ring to it, a synthetic flavour that is markedly different from the wholesome, toasty graininess of actual malted barley. This taste is more like canned corn kernels and is unpleasant, even off-putting.

The one thing I hear in defense of large commercial breweries is that they're consistent; like McDonalds, their beer taste the same everywhere. You always know what you're getting. To replicate a fermented product like beer to the same standards time and time again on a massive scale isn't easy. This is true.

But who wants to make shitty beer? And who wants to drink shitty beer? I tasted my first Silver Creek Lager over a decade ago and it was just as insipid then as it is now. That's an impressive feat but not one I think worthy of commending. Consistency is a good attribute - quality is a better one.

The folks at Sleeman aren't dummies. They've left this recipe the same for good reason: it sells. This lager may be an injustice to the Czech and German ones that originally inspired it but, sorry to say, its bland, sweet, light-bodied and firmly carbonated qualities are exactly what most consumers look for.",2.25

S: Apple, skunk, corn. Mild.
T: Apple, mild bread, corny. Mild sweetness, pleasant bitterness.
F: Crisp and bright, but just slightly over carbonated.
O: Inoffensive but unremarkable. I wouldn't avoid it, but I wouldn't seek it out either.",2.75
Sleeman Silver Creek Lager,"A - Pale straw colour. Good deal of carbonation. Head fades quickly with no real lacing.

S - A slight skunky smell at the beginning, with an apple scent as well. Almost has a cider-like sweet smell, but not in an appealing sense when I'm about to drink a lager.

T - More of the apple like smell, but the taste is fortunately not as sweet. Slightly bitter aftertaste, though no real hop presence. A bit of a musty taste at the very end as well.

F - Carbonation is appropriate for the style. Fairly crisp and refreshing.

O - Overall slightly unimpressed with this one, not that I had overly high expectations. I think I can say this is my least favourite Sleeman product, and I'm not typically a big fan of the company either. I haven't had the Light or the Original Draught in a while, but from what I remember I enjoyed them both slightly more. However, it is still a serviceable lager that could be consumed in large amounts, and the unappealing factors would likely diminish after the first 2 or 3.",2.75

The lime was too low, the salt way too high, and then the carbonation was off. Felt too watery, and not in a refreshing way. I will not be drinking this by the beach later.

Only thing slightly beery about it is perhaps a tiny hint of hops on the back end. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Heineken Lager Beer,"I put together a mix-six at the local supermarket. I included a bottle of Heineken. I hadn't had a Heineken in years--maybe 40; I remember it as a crisp, fresh, beer, much better than the American AALs of the era. I saw the ""malt lager"" appellation on the label, and thought that this must be a new product, an all-malt Heineken. Turns out it's the same, classic Heineken: It's an adjunct based lager, a bit hoppy but with a sweet overlay in the flavor that I suppose is a result of the corn in the recipe. I was a bit surprised by the extent to which I disliked it--I could barely finish the bottle. The sweetness clung to it all the way down. I love all things Dutch--visiting the country, cycling in it, exploring and savoring Amsterdam--with the exception, I guess, of this beer.",2.75
Heineken Lager Beer,"Poured from a 24oz can best by March 2023 into a pils glass.

On thr pour a fine 3 finger head forms woth a light straw body that has strong carbonation. Head retention is good, but it becomes fizzy looking. Vague lacing.

Aroma is largely light skunked hops, mistreated lager yeast, and some light but bright esters. Maybe some vague corniness but not a lot of malt other than that.

Taste is quite similar to the smell woth the same off notes right up front. As some of the cheap euro characteristics fade a slight floral happiness does stick through in the largely bitter hop extract. Once again a light and oxidized corny maltiness barely shows up on the finish.

Feel is fizzy with a lot of carbonation bite. It's easy to drink but not the smoothest from all the off flavors. Not as watery as expected but bretty light. Longer finish but not great.

Overall this is a meh beer that's overpriced I only picked it up because it's the last thing that isn't a high gravity malt liquor left that I haven't reviewed out of the 24oz singles at my local shitty liquor store.

Heineken Lager Beer,Drinkable beer if it’s fresh and ice cold. Once it begins to warm up the taste turns sour and skunky. This is a beer I’ll drink if it’s given to me but will never buy. At $3.40 per can in Ontario there are a lot of better options at the same price or cheaper.,2.5
Heineken Lager Beer,"Sparkling pale gold with a tall white head settling to a very thickly persistent white blanket clinging well in doily lacing.

Just now realizing I have only ever had Heine Light, this is way less skunky than its younger sister, and it's actually got some faint banana characteristics. Color me dumbfounded!

Aside from that, there are notes of fresh baked buns with a slight tang of lemon rind, and its got a fluffy medium body that finishes semi-dry.

Wow, I really thought this would be a sub-3 score.",3.0

Polar Pilsen,"DATE: July 25, 2022... OCCASION: our first night in Aruba is a success--time to celebrate with a beer I haven't had in more than two decades... GLASSWARE: nondescript 10 oz. pokal... a picture of consistency: its light golden amber body builds a bank of soft, craggy head that leaves behind articulate lacing--attractive, save for the lack of effervescence... sharp, sweet malts, burnt toffee, a bit of weirdly expressed bitterness, candied sugars, and perfumed hops make this a beer that sends a ""drink me quickly"" message... beefier than expected, it holds its place long enough after the initial sip to leave a softer, grainy finish... a bit more than a rinser, the malts are slightly burnt, sweet and almost chewable--striking for a beer that otherwise requires a tropical setting to be enjoyed... I don't mind that I waited this long to review a beer I innocently, randomly ordered in Russell's--it most likely tastes better in the setting we're in now!",2.25
Polar Pilsen,Pretty bad. Essentially less nose than Michael Jackson. Low on flavor. Tastes like cheap 28oz. clearglass lager in the hood in August. Feel is fine for 8oz but it gets flat quick. Wouldn’t really purchase this with my own money by choice if there were other options.,2.75

Polar Pilsen,"The pour is from an 8 oz. can, that's rather small & interesting. Oh look there is a cute polar bear on the front of the can & the beer pour a medium flow of carbonation with a white foamy head that dies down rather quickly. I do notice a best by date on the bottom of the can which indicates that they're giving this beer a long shelf life. The aroma is of grains with faint corn in the background. The taste matches the nose, but it's subpar compared to many other pilsner beers that I've had in the past. I don't know if this beer is brewed in Aruba, Venezuela, or Florida but wherever it's from it needs a tweak here & there. . It's not a disgusting pilsner nor is it a tasty one either. Cheers! C",3.0

T- Same as the smell. Very mild flavours of grain and a grassy hoppiness.

F- Light body and fairly high carbonation. Refreshing would be a solid descriptor.

O- Compared to most AAL's, this brew is fantastic. It doesn't have anything offputting and doesn't really have much to offer. Refreshing and cheap. If I make it to Cuba again, you can bet I'll be putting back some Cristal on the beach.",3.5
Cerveza Cristal,"Had countless cans of this as well as on tap samples while away in Cuba for a week. Served cold into a pilsner glass.

Appearance -Pale golden color, clear with plenty of carbonation. A small cap of white head is poured and sometimes lingers.

Smell - Not a lot here, some faint graininess in general and no off aromas, so that's a plus.

Taste - Again not a lot of flavor, light grassy flavors and a hint of grain with nothing off-putting.

Mouthfeel - Smooth and watery, light bodied with just enough crisp carbonation to make things interesting.

Overall - While not a great beer, it really does hit the spot and when laying on a beach or poolside for hours under the hot Cuban sun. A beer that very much can get some positive ratings due to the memories it invokes. For what it is, it is quite good. Dos cervezas por favor!",3.25

Cerveza Cristal,"Appearance - pours a pale straw color with a finger and a half of head. Crystal clear.

Aroma - Normal adjunct lager smell with a slightly stronger bitterness than american and european variants.

Taste - Fresh crisp lager yeast flavor with some light malt first followed by a nice balancing bitterness. its an ok adjuct lager from a can, from a bottle it was skunky (green bottle :/)

Feel - light crisp and clean, again nothing more or less special than other adjuncts.

Overall - This is the most popular beer in Cuba, and just like anywhere its a crisp easy drinking party beer without much flavor. It fits the style and as much as adjuncts arnt my thing, I kicked back more than a few of these during my time in Cuba.

Birra Peroni,"Birra Peroni s.r.l. “Peroni”
33 cl brown glass bottle, “Best Before End 12/20” and sampled on 27 November 2019

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is not my first Peroni, nor will it be the last, although I don’t think there will be too many more. It’s poured a clear golden body beneath a short head of white that’s dropped before my eyes. This is probably not a “beer clean” glass but none of the Peroni beers that I’ve sampled have had very good head retention and lacing. The aroma expresses sweet grainy malt with a little bit of an herbal hop component to it. It’s clean, and welcoming. The flavor follows, and its sweetness is balanced by a stiff bitterness that helps to dry it in the end but ultimately leaves some malt lingering. Interestingly enough, the bitterness and some herbal hops linger as well. It’s a decent Euro lager that serves its purpose. In the mouth it’s medium bodied and gently crisp with a fine, gently effervescent carbonation that’s quite nice. It might not be the best but if you’re wanting for a train or flight and there’s nothing else available it’s enjoyable.

Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium golden color with a moderate to strong white and spotted head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: The skunk comes out of the glass on this one. Initial aromas of skunk and light struck beer. Then some underlying pale and cracker malts. Some cereal malts with light flowery notes.

Flavor: Mild flavors of pale malts, cereal malts, white bread malts. Some suds and yeast. A smooth and wet cereal malt finish. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. a balanced finish. (4.00)

Overall: For drinking this one 6 months past the expiration date, it wasn't the worst I've had. Sure it was light-struck and skunky. Past that it had nice cereal malts.

Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,"A very light lager in the veins of many ""lowtier lagers"" like Heineken and Carlsberg. A bit lighter even. Not very strange maybe, since the brand is owned by Carlsberg.

Not much more than that. Doesn't taste a lot. Very mediocre, but works good a really hot day or when you just want something easy to drink like all of these ""mowing the lawn""-beers. I could see myself grabbing one of these in the summer.

Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer,"i love trying international lagers from strange locations or places that are not commonly known for their beer, this was a cool find, and its a fine brew, checks all the boxes for the style without really being unique or different in any way, but its not cheap to me at all, nothing metallic, sweet, adjuncty, or watered down, its seems all malt to me, slightly fuller feeling, and the finish would be very clean if it wasnt for the skunky green bottle character that unfortunately plagues it. i always try to not judge a beer like this too harshly for something like that, hard to police quality worlds away. this has a great mouthfeel with its round body and intense carbonation, and its boldly flavored enough to stand up to a meaty garlicky gyro, probably its ideal food context, seems born for that. a lesser lager would easily be overwhelmed here. id love to try it fresher sometime, but i do think it translates pretty well even still, kind of reminds me of green bottle moosehead growing up, i will always have a soft spot for beers like this. cool to have something international and different here in boise, i enjoyed this with my food at meraki downtown, a place i definitely recommend!",3.25

Served in a .4L pilsener glass.

Appearance: Clear, pale yellow body with a big, soft, white head that actually retained pretty well. A blanket of lace trailed the head as it descended, but had little staying power on the glass walls. Pretty active carbonation could be seen within.

Smell: Faint. Lager yeast and sweet grains I suppose.

Taste: Sweet, lightly toasted grains, lager yeast, and mild grassy hops. Boring, but otherwise okay.

Bergenbier,"Picked up from Fidelio Supermarket in Ia&#351;i, Romania.

Golden 50cl can with a yellow and blue crest and a mountain. A couple of possibly stylistic medals adorn the front of the beer. Some wild mottos in Romanian as well. Wish I could read them, I'm sure they're amazing.

Pours a darkish yellow-gold colour. Lots of coarse-bubbled carbonation, feeding a large buy collapsible white head of rocky foam. Minimal lacing. No retention.

Slight meaty aroma on the nose, and a hint of salt. Mostly, though, it's the CO2; an overcarbonated smell of seltzer water. I would have said something pleasant about it, but I can't really find anything. Pretty bland.

Taste is actually ok, but still pretty bland. It has a surprising sweetness on the front palate, even (although it's sacrilege to say it) a little reminiscent of the Belgian yeast character, which the dips to a quite biting hint of hops. I'm surprised just how good this is on the palate, given the appearance and smell were marking this as a complete dud. Yeah, it grows on you. Mouthfeel is still definitely suffering from the high carbonation though.

It's ultimately quite a drinkable brew, but there's a huge polarity gap between the smell and the taste. If you don't let your first impressions fool you, this one might just take you by surprise.",3.0

Bergenbier,"The second beer in my Eastern European lager afternoon and as far as I can remember, my first ever Romianian beer of any sort.

Browm 50cl bottle with a BBD of 14th May 2008,it was drank on a sunny but cold Saturday in Feb 2008.

The beer was poured into my little Veltins Pilsner glass two and a half times.

Pale, clear and golden body, large white head, very little carbonisation, as in few bubbles rising to the head. The head by the way soon fell away to a thin covering and collar.

The normal 3 score for a non-smelling lager/pilsner.

Almost tasteless (like Bitburger), it is dry cardboard with K9P dripped on the make it wet. Very weak on the alcohol feel as well, the bottle claims 4.8%, it seemed more like a 3.0% to me.

This is one of the worst beers I've ever had and why anyone would go to the trouble of importing it into the UK is beyond me.

Apperance: Pours a clear, light yellow body with a fizzy white head. Lightly effervescent.

Smell: Exceedingly light pale malts with a touch of spicy hops. The aroma is marred by the addition of cooked musty vegetables.

Taste: Thin, weak maltiness with a subtle sweetness and some spice-minded hops are thrown under the bus by that darned vegetal flavor which rides the tongue through to the finish.

Carlton Dry,"Carlton Dry is one of a handful of popular 'low -carb' marketed Dry beers that has taken the Australian macro lager market by storm. Popular by people who think it's a healthier choice than a normal full strength beer. Coming in at 4.5% ABV, it's only .1% less ABV than Carlton & United's flagship beer, Carlton Draught, which this beer is modeled off. So let's see. Poured into my Arundel Brewery pint Glass from a 375ml can.

Look: Bog standard Australian macro adjunct lager appearance. Golden straw, filtered, clear, Lot of thin bubbles racing their way up to a frothy head that's maybe a finger thick.

Smell: Classic Australian lager smell. Pride of Ringwood hops, corn, slightly bready, metallic ring, vegetables.

Taste: Quite sweet and smooth. Very low, if not almost redundant bitterness. Dryish finish, but very sweet. Has a white breadiness to it, but overall it's very sweet. Very inoffensive.

Feel: It's clean, crisp and refreshing. What you're looking for in a lager. Medium body, a touch watery but that helps the reshing aspect.

Overall: Another standard, easy drinking Australian lager that's designed to be thrown back and drunk en-mass without really acknowledging the flavours behind the beer. In the hot sun, it's fine to quench your thirst after a bit of yard work. I pick up a 6 pack infrequently in summer if I'm after a few refreshing, easy drinking, no thinking beers after working outside, but only if it's on special. The marketing behind these beers is that it's supposedly 'low carb', which so many fall for. Certainly not drinking or buying it for any 'health' aspects. I",2.25
Carlton Dry,"I am extremely happy and dissatisfied with this product. The taste deliciously terrible. CRISP. I left it out with the cap off in 108°F or 30°C and it tastes like shit. No bubbles whatsoever. CRISP. I tried to put it in the freezer and it exploded... are you guys secretly isis or something? Seriously crisp. The worst thing is that I tried to BOTTLE SOME DOG with it and the Glass DIDNT EVEN BREAK. CRISP. AND I GOT STABBED BECAUSE OF IT.

Over all 10/23 score",1.0
Carlton Dry,"Hanging in Kellyville smoking a big ol' beef butt in the kettle.
This beer has a pale amber color like you expect from a backyard lager.
It was smokey by the kettle but it smelled ok, a bit of foam in the nose so I sneezed.
The call it an american lager but it's better than that. Seemed like a Blue Collar Beer.
Nice dry overall, not over carbureted.

Carlton Dry,"The schooner of brew, from the tap, arrived a very pale yellow with 1 cm of foam. The aroma was very light, but what waft into the nostrils was distinctly grain and adjunct.

For me, this is not quite as offensive as Carlton Draught, though not much better. Stale tasting grain, corn and husk, coupled with an oddly sweet note (it's only 0.05% sugar), metallic hops, low to moderate bitterness and a bone dry finish.

It's not entirely in the name, but this is just another in a long (and becoming longer) list of dry, low-carb, low-taste lagers. Worse still, for me it is actually one of the worst of a very poor bunch. It seems the Carlton name remains ubiquitous with crappy beer.",2.0
Carlton Dry,"Pours a standard beer gold. The colour of beer. Carbonation is steady but not intense. Head is white, webbed all around and sinking in random spots. Leaves a ring of lacing foam, but little lacing from the body of the beer. Looks pretty standard.

Nose has not much going on at all. First impression is it smells like vomit. There is a sweet, light honey touch and a disturbing raw meat character to that. No hops whatsoever, smell is not simple but is really, genuinely bad. Not looking forward to drinking. Maybe if I hold my nose I can get this down.

Taste does have that really bizarre meaty character on the first sip. Mid-palate, on the plu side, has NO bizarre meaty character. Hooray! Rejoice! The mid-palate has no meaty character! Shame, though, and woe - accursed be the middle, for of flavour there be none. Nay meat nor malt nor grain, just ye olde water, and very thin and unpalatable it be. Finish be called ""dry"" by the lost souls who market yon grog, but I simply calls it ""bad"". Look, garbled early modern English/pirate crap aside, it tastes like pouring turpentine down the throat, I imagine. Chemical-metallic with a sharp, stinging sensation in the throat which cannot be put down to the 4.5% alc.

Other than that there's nothing to this at all. Taste is blah, and mouthfeel is bleeeeurgh. No hopping, no real malt. All they've done here is reduced a cheap beer to its bare minimum and all you can taste is the cheap. It could never be cheap enough though.",1.5
Carlton Dry,"Tiny generic lager head, with slight lacing. Crystal clear bronze pour.

Overall, pretty horrible. Never buying this again.",2.0
Carlton Dry,"I cannot work out how this is different from the Premium Dry already listed but they do have different ABVs.

This pours a very pale golden colour. Reasonable head but not very dense. Quickly disappears.

Some hoppy aromas in there. Bit of biscuit as well.

Medium bodied.

A very average beer.",2.0
Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"I dug this relatively well, it essentially tasted like Modelo which isn't shocking considering...ya know...made by Modelo. Overall one of the more enjoyable Mexican beers I've had. People rate macros way too critically. It will never have the same standard as craft beer so don't expect it to",3.5
Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"Crystal clear, super light straw in color, a nice white head with minimal retention.

Minimal nose; just some light malt graininess with a hint of something sweet, verging on fresh corn but not really certain here.

Taste comes of as grainy, slightly Frosted Flakes like, like as if you removed all that sugar coating; minor hops on the finish and I even feel like I even pick up just the slightest hint of toasted malt as well.

Very nice mouthfeel to this beer for me; incredibly light and drinkable. It goes down like water and is very refreshing. As the nose suggests there is a slight sweetness but it dries out very nicely on the finish and doesn’t linger; also low bitterness on the finish.

I have to say I'm enjoying this beer quite a bit; it drinks very nicely and is very well balanced. A very good beer to refresh with on a hot day. This beer is definitely best drank cold; as it warms some of the smoothness of the the body dissipates as the sweetness shows a little more. Glad to have tried this one, incredibly drinkable and quick to disappear from the glass.",3.5
Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"There's little going on here: little to see, little to smell. Taste isn't bad for a macro lager, however; it's very clean, with very little of the corny and syrupy sweetness that dooms most AALs. The mouthfeel is wonderfully crisp and smooth.

I can't say the lime improved the taste, contrary to popular opinion; I recommend you try it both ways and see what works for you.

Overall, this is a solid enough take on a Mexican pilsner.",3.5

Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"Poured into a pint glass from a 24oz can

On the pour a 1 finger head forms then just as fast disappears to just a thin ring of bubbles around the glass, then eventually to nothing. A good amount of lazy carbonation in a body that is a bit darker than most light lagers but still very pale.

Aroma is a bit off but not bad like some cheap lagers. Dominated by yeast with some actual complexity which is nice and some decent light malts. Any hops are very oxidized. Not bad just not great and a bit old.

Flavor is actually nice for the style I can pick out malts and hop bitterness. The yeast is also a lot cleaner in the taste than the aroma although not perfect it's pretty dang good. Some light corniness but a lot of crackery malts as well. On the front there Is a bit of cheap sourness but it fades pretty fast.

Feel is crisp if not a bit watery, but still big enough to be passable. Refreshing and easy to drink but not the lightest beer in the world, which again I appreciate.

Overall this is really good for an adjunct lager, the hops are a bit old tasting, but actually detectable, and it maintains Refreshing crispness the style should carry without being skunked.",3.0

Overall: a good summer beer.",3.25
Cerveza Pacifico Clara,The key to this beer is how fresh it is when you buy it..It's really good fresh..The data code for freshness is the the first letter with A meaning bottled in January. Unfortunately this beer is allowed to be on the shelf forever before being pulled and by that time is skunky..If your thinking of buying it check the code to see if it is within 90 days fresh or don't buy it.,3.25
Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"Had Pacifico Clara at Papito's Grill, Madison, Miss., on draft into tumbler.

Pours straw-gold with clarity and 1/2-finger near-white head, with some retention, leaving a little scattered lace. Not unpleasant aroma of sweet corn malt, and a little fruit as warms. Flavor is moderately sweet corn, and not much else, with a little carbonation and a touch of hop spice slightly crisping the finish.

No obvious defects in this beer, which drinks a little like a soft cream ale.",3.25
Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"I had this on tap at a local Mexican restaurant. It was served in a frozen beer mug with a slice of lime on the rim, which I put in the beer.

Color is dull yellow. It has a small head that didn’t stick around. Light carbonation. Flavor was light, well balanced between malt and hops, with hints of bread and corn—and the lime went really well with it. This isn’t going to displace your favorite craft beer, but it was great ice cold with chips and salsa. I’ll enjoy it again with Mexican food in the future.",3.25

Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"Poured from 24oz can into a dimpled mug. Best by September 2022.

Appearance: medium-gold, almost crystal-clear body with a finger of frothy eggshell foam and a very light apparent effervescence. Not bad, although the head subsides pretty quickly.

Smell: sweet and rather corny, with minimal hops. I do prefer this kind of beer in a can, as it has a minimal chance of getting skunked. But this beer is kind of blah.

Taste: a bit sweet and a bit corny, but neither as much as the aroma. There is actual bitterness here, too, which I like. While this might be a great beach beer, on its workaday merits it's merely an OK beer.

Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a decent carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: a perfectly cromulent sunshine beer, but not one that I would go to otherwise.",3.25

Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"Drank from a 12 ounce bottle. Scores are based on the style.

Look - The bright yellow of the label is certainly eye-catching, but it looks more like a billboard for a beer than a beer itself. Rarely do I advocate for just words and no pictures on the label, but honestly, the life preserver and other accessories pictured here act as a lot of visual clutter.

Smell - Wet dog. Nothing but. An assault on the nostrils. What is this? Absolutely vile.

Taste - Thankfully the taste is nothing like the smell. Actually fairly light and refreshing. Pretty good balance on the sweet/bitter dichotomy. Mild tone overall. As long as your sniffer doesn't catch wind of this, it's pretty good.

Feel - Could do with a hair more fizz, but it's just as thick as it should be. It lingers a few milliseconds too long, some extra effervescence would really brighten this up.

Overall - The beer tastes good. Pretty darn good to be honest. The visual appeal is mostly mediocre, but the odor is straight up offensive. Close to being a good beer, but it couldn't quite bring it home.",3.0
Cerveza Pacifico Clara,"Light thin straw color. Bready malt almost reminiscent of an Oktoberfest hits the nose. Rice as well.

Bready malt backbone with some surprisingly strong fruity notes coming through. The finish brings it down by being a bit metallic and unfortunately brings to mind college cheap keg beer. The opening notes are pleasant though.

Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated.

This beer is what it is. It’s a somewhat, sort of inexpensive beer with a better taste than a lot of American adjuncts. It’s 15.48 at my local Wal Mart, and spending an extra two dollars can get you a 12 pack of much higher quality. If this beer were 12 dollars for a 12 pack you’d have a winner.

The initial smells can only be described as grainy. There is a slight orange citrus coming through – could do with some more power on the citrus side.

The sensation of the first mouthful is surprisingly bitter, strong and heavy for a lager which is fine by me. The problem is that the initial bitterness is replaced by the metallic taste that comes through with all too many lagers.

There is nothing special about the appearance. Lots of action going on. Very light copper-ish color. Small lacing, small head.

Smells awful. Smells like a lizard fell into my car's air conditioner, died, stayed in there for 13 days and then I turned the AC on max.

I didn't finish this beer. It tastes like carbonated piss. In fact, this is the most carbonated beer I've ever had. Bud Light and Coors Light reign supreme over this beer. Blue Tongue literally tastes and feels more like club soda than actual beer. If anyone drank enough of this to become intoxicated, they should be shot on site.

Mouthfeel is just as bad. It tastes like licking a corroding battery. Its almost as if the brewery stole a bunch of pennies from the homeless, melted them and used them as ingredients in this beer.

The drinkability is rated low because you can't stomach this beer.

Nose has a fair hit of hops with a strong POW aroma. Unpleasant sticky sweet fragrance rather like honey, but I think it's a rice adjunct aroma. Pretty standard and a bit unpleasant.

A strong sticky rice flavour on the mid-palate, quite insipid. Mostly saccharine with a bit of a very light phenolic hop towards the back. Finish is very bland, with not much, really doesn't have much of an aftertaste. A bit sweet is all, fairly boring and thin.

Mouthfeel is not too bad, a bit sticky for a pale lager though. A little bit of tingle saves it.

Aroma is slightly grassy with a chemical smell that is so typical for Pride of Ringwood.

Taste is similar and a tad sweet,but quite drinkable if you drink it from the bottle close to freezing point. (stay away from glassware since you might inhale the skunk aroma)

The lack of off flavours and pride of ringwood metal puts this a cut above the macro lagers of Australia. Sadly, there is little other taste to recommend it by - sugary sweetness, faint husk and grain flavour, very little hop character or bitterness, and a dry finish with little aftertaste.

The blokes at Bluetongue obviously believe in the philosophy that a blonde lager should be crisp, refreshing, and almost devoid of flavour.

Bluetongue Premium Lager,"Man I hate this beer and what it represents.

Bluetongue is (part ?)-owned by a prominent Sydney media player, and has been a remarkable success story in how one can convince the beer-swilling populace that they don't have to remain loyal to VB or New.

I wish I had a buck for every BBQ coversation I've had where the bloke says ""Did you say you're into beer ? Have you tried that Bluetongue... jeez it's good"".

So it's got a very, very big market: the brand-loyal beer drinker who is open to trying something ""premium"" (other than Crown Lager).

But for those who actually do know their ales from their lagers, it is a disappointing beer. Starts with nice grain & malt & hop aromas, but it all slips away into an incipid flavour & mouthfeel.

Stick to Cascade Premium Lager, is my suggestion.",2.5
Bluetongue Premium Lager,"Bluetongue's pale, straw gold lager is crystal clear and teeming with standard sized bubbles that race to the surface. The bright white head drops shortly, but a thin surface covering is maintained by the rising bubbles; and it does leave some nice rings of craggy lace in its wake.

The nose is lightly skunked (this has a green bottle, whereas their pilsner is brown), but not enough to overshadow its sweetish malt and remaining grassy hops.

In the mouth it's effervescent and crisp with a medium body.

The flavor is fuller than might be expected, and offers some lightly sweet and surprisingly grainy maltiness (I was expecting more adjunct) and grassy and floral hop flavors. It's backed by a solid bitterness, and it finishes dry with a quick passing note of grainy malt that fades to reveal some some residual hop flavor and bitterness.

Overall, this compares quite nicely with many European lagers. It's refreshing, rounded, and has enough character and integrity to keep it interesting and rewarding for more than one go round. Quite nice!",4.0
Bluetongue Premium Lager,"Green 12 oz bottle. Reptile on the label has a blue tongue. Quick blurb on the back claims its naturally brewed in the finest traditions of Australia's Hunter Valley. Ok, fair enough, I'm just curious what the fine tradition Hunter Valley has? Anyway on to the brew at hand. Poured into a pils glass it forms a decent fizz head that falls to a thin cover and spotty lace. The body of this brew is amazingly pale and ultra highly filtered, hardly a shade of color to this.

Light, sweet malts hit the palate first. Heavy Grainy, wheat, hay aspect to this and not all that clean to me. It's always been hard for me to describe most Euro Pales, there is something about them that reminds me of a baby's diaper type funkyness too them. Must be something in the malts I would guess because as with the others this is a fresh offering. A bit of a cooked vegetables on the backside. Finishes fairly crisp.

Bluetongue Premium Lager,"Lightish champagne gold. Filmy head, which disappears very quickly. Minimal lacing and carbonation. Quite insipid looking.

Nice sharp entry on the palate. Crisp bitterness and a hint of lager yeastiness. Drops away very quickly to a watery aftertaste. It's remarkably bland, but I do believe it's better than the generic Australian swill. It's an easy drinking, rather forgettable beer.",3.5
Bluetongue Premium Lager,"I am drinking a bottle of this chilled in a pint glass.
The beer pours a bright clear gold color with bleached white head that foams up 1 cm and fades quickly to a thin sruface layer. The aroma is grainy malt and dominant skunkiness. uh oh!
First sip reveals lite to medium body with fine mild carbonation.
Flavor is starting sweet caramel and sugar witha bit of spicy and grassy hops moving in and then finishes grainy and husky malt. The skunk does not come through on the flavor much as the nose had advertised. A decent enough drinking beer that goes down easy. i wish it didnt smell so bad!",3.5

Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,"Picked up a 500ml can at Albert Heijn supermarket. A beer calling itself ""Kanon"" is not something I can resist.

I wish I had though.

Kanon pours like a lazy lager, slightly gloopy but bright and golden. Mildly carbonated, with a bit of white fluff pretending to be a head. Visually interchangeable with any other ""superlager"" (think Gordon's Finest Platinum and siblings).

The nose, while initially pleasantly fruity, quickly turns ugly: solvents and booze, with a bland undertow of dough-like malt. A bit chemical. Literally takes 2 seconds to lose all fragrance in the glass.

Flavour is booze, layered with booze, with hints of booze and a delicate touch of booze. Seriously: it's a mouth-numbingly boozy and altogether unpleasant monster of a beer. While there are plenty beers around with higher ABV, this is one of those beers which seems to be designed just to show off the booziness.

Overall, this beer does not seem to be designed for people who actually enjoy drinking beer. People who enjoy getting drunk possibly might like it, as it gets the job done quickly, if a little unpleasantly.",1.5
Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,"With incredible strength that lands this massive lager somewhere between a blonde dopplebock and an imperial pilsner, the beer piques my interest in ways that I hadn't thought possible during my travels in Curacao. Taking a break from island activities and settling in with this beer and a good old American basketball game on television makes for one memorable evening.

The beer opens with a hearty pilsner pour that showcases its immense malt additions with strong honey-straw colors, firm golden highlights, and brilliant clarity. Racy carbonation fuels a stark white head that retains well for half the session, but the foam eventually succumbs to the enormous alcohols.

Honey, herbs, flowery notes, and a grainy-sweet scent emit from the glass and fill the nose with a strong presence of freshly kilned barley, baking bread, cookie dough, and springtime bouquet. Because of the light character of malt and hops, the strong alcohols allow for a rosy spirits scent to emerge.

Malt forward flavors capture well the taste of honey, sweet grains, bread dough, and powdered sugar with much more concentrated taste than the standard strength versions of pilsner beer. Balanced with noble German hops, the floral aromas turn honey-like with perfume and bright taste. Lightly herbal, early notes of lemongrass and fresh grasses turn mildly spicy and bitter to finish. Apple-like sulfur and esters allow for fruitiness that shares pear and apricot notes to rise from time to time.

Medium-full in texture, the residual sweetness gives the beer a fuller and somewhat oily feel, similar to corn syrups. Peppery carbonation gives a zesty mouthfeel with mild carbonic bite in mid palate and finish. The beer closes with very warm alcohols, semi-dry maltiness, and stubborn sweetness to persist in aftertaste.

The strength of Kanon definitely earns its namesake with the power that's twice that of the standard pilsner. This lands the beer somewhere between Samichlaus Helles and a plethora of American microbrewed imperial pilsners.",3.5
Grolsch Krachtig Kanon,"We pour a glowing golden brew. It holds a one finger head of big tannish bubbles. This shows nice retention, leaving spots of lacing all around the glass. Carbonation appears highly active, and no sediment or haze is noted. The nose is sweet, with huge booze, and cloying synthetic strawberry sweetness. The malts are adjuncty and bitter, but lighten up with a pale toast around the edges. With warmth come light banana esters, but even these seem forced and fake. Our first impression is in regard to the surprising bitterness. As we sip, that same cloying sweetness from the nose comes in the form of dextrin sugars and concentrated berry syrups. Booze is apparent right off the bat, giving black pepper spice and lactic sourness. The middle peaks with fusel, fiery booze, decimating all flavoring besides the pale malt base. The malts enhance a bit towards the end, with more caramel sweetness and depth, and some of that toast from the nose begins to seep out. Otherwise, the booziness reigns king and continues through to the end. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of booze and stale adjuncty malts, under ripe bananas, and light caramel. The body is medium, and a bit on the syrupy side, while carbonation is higher. The bubbles prickle the tongue, and leave a big foam throughout the mouth. This initially coats, but eventually dries with astringency from all the massive booziness. There is okay slurp and smack with each sip. The abv is huge, and the beer drinks slowly for that reason.

Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. While it seemed way overdone, muddy, and forced, some of the notes enlivened the nostrils. The flavoring suffered from being overly boozy, and you really had a hard time getting past that to find much of anything at all. Had they been willing to subdue that a bit more, it could have potentially been a much more curious, complex drink.",3.0

We tried calling the Moosehead rep at a different liquor store. Same result. This was all before the pandemic, meaning no trips to Canada for MD. Finally this summer after two years of no boarder crossing, we brought Moose Light home. It went down like nothing as the boys gathered for a weekend in Maine. The beer was fine.

Moosehead Light,"Moosehead Breweries Ltd. ""Moosehead Light""
12 fl. oz. green glass bottle, production coded but without freshness dating

Notes via stream of consciousness: Not surprisingly, Moosehead Light tastes a lot like Moosehead, it's just not as rich, nor as hoppy. I'll assume that they're just adding water to lighten it, but it could be more complicated than that. I doubt there's any high-gravity brewing going on that produces more than just one beer though, it's too clean and balanced for that. It's very well made, and the balance that you find in the regular Moosehead remains intact; it's just a little lighter and more refreshing. Of course I still prefer the standard Moosehead, but if I have to have a light beer this is one of my ""go-to"" lights. So let me run through its good points and bad points as compared to the regular. #1, the appearance is not as good. The clear straw-gold body is nice but the head retention and lacing are lacking. #2, the nose is lacking. The beautiful combination of sweetish grainy malt and herbal and floral hops found in the original just isn't there. It's still OK for a light beer, but not nearly as full or bright. #3, just like the aroma, the flavor is watered down (most likely literally). There's some grainy malt which is nice, and some lightly floral and softly herbal hops, but it's not completely satisfying. Again, as a light beer it works, and the cleanliness and balance are impeccable. #4, the finish is good. It remains dry but with some malt and hop character remaining, which is rare for light beers as they usually just disappear from the palate. #5, the body suffers a little bit but not by too much, and the carbonation is gently crisp. It's not too watery. Conclusion: it's at the very least refreshing, I think everyone will give it that, but it's also fairly satisfying - it's like you're drinking a real beer and not some hop-less and almost malt-less carbonated-water. Two thumbs up as far as light beers go!",3.25

Moosehead Light,"Serving Type: 341 mL bottle

Having Been born and raised (and currently living) in New Brunswick, I've grown quite accustomed to the taste of Moosehead Light as it would easily be the most popular Light Beer in this province.

A- The typical golden straw color of the average American Macro Lager. Nothing special here but nothing to really complain about either.

S- The scent of Moosehead Light is quite sweet. Malty cereal grains is really all I can draw from the scent. Once again, nothing particularly interesting about this perspective of the beer but then again, who cares about how a light beer smells??

T- Much like the scent, the taste is fairly sweet with notes of cereal grains (similar to Molson Canadian). Not entirely pleasing but it is quite refreshing on a hot day.

M- Medium to high carbonation. Thin and water-like; a trait that pairs well with its refreshing taste.

O- Don't let my close upbringing with this beer dissuade from the fact that this beer is a great one (speaking of Light Macro Lagers, of course). No, it doesn't hold a candle to the great craft beers in the market today but I really do appreciate Moosehead Light for what it is. If you're looking for a relatively cheap and refreshing light beer and you have the opportunity to pick it up, go ahead and do so. If you go in with the likes of bud light/ coors light in your mind, you might even be a little bit impressed ;D",2.5

Chill Caribbean Beer,"DATE: July 30, 2022... OCCASION: preparing for the Terrazo Italiano dining experience with the first of three Balashi products to sample... pours a flat, sallow golden body almost devoid of bubbles, with a head that swiftly dissipates to a ring of off-white head--squarely in line with beers that require limes... dish detergent lemon, some astringency, something akin to the garden hose, and cracker malts that don't really stir the interest much... its palate refreshes, swift with a slick malt base, enough effervescence to register its ""real"" ingredients, and a soft, simple aftertaste that cleans rather than satisfies... the flavor is as expected--a beer whose name is, in terms of advertising, a glittering generality, is reduced to the temperature to which it is served... slammable in its 7.4-ounce bottles, it doesn't move the needle for me, though maybe if I were a twenty-something set loose in Aruba, this might be the morning/afternoon beer that keeps me hydrated until the night arrives... for now, it's pure novelty and a donation to Balashi--you can't beat fresh, home-brewed beer in that regard!",2.0

FEEL: Light bodied and well carbonated. Aftertaste has a bit of the DMS and cooked veggie thing going on.

Pours a hazy, watery, stale blood brown red producing only a hint of rusty, short-lived, head that leaves a thin coat of grainy wash that I would not dignify by calling it lace. Aroma is tomato & lime with a faint hint of beer/adjunct grains drowning in the background. Taste is stale tomato juice flavored mineral water: tomato, vegetal, brine, lime & a thin beer/adjunct grain hint. Does not list having chilis in it but it has a smoky chili/thin Tabasco hint in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with high carbonation, slick with spice & a peppery, prickly bite. It is not nearly so drinkable as Bud Light Chelada. Puts you in mind of a stale, watery, virgin Bloody Mary.",2.25
Modelo Especial Chelada,Taste note to me are lime and light lime juice. Salty and some what sweet. It's a easy drink and taste good to me at least. For its price and flavor it's something I would suggest specially with cooking on a grill. Seems like a great hot weather beer as well.,3.5
Modelo Especial Chelada,"24oz can poured into Shock Top weizen glass. No discernable date, but there are some characters stamped on the bottom of the can. Normally bars serve cheladas in a chalice, tulip, oversized wine glass or large mug. But the only reason they tend to do that is for presentation purposes, so they can fit in a bunch of garnishes like celery or sometimes upside-down beer bottles. But if you're drinking it properly, pre-pepared without the garnishes, the proper glass to pour it in is very narrow like a weizenglass (my pick), a narrow stange, or even straight from the bottle or can itself. This is because it's a very effervescent style like a soda, and loses its carbonation easily, so you want to reduce that as much as possible so you don't drink it flat.

Appearance - Virtually non existent, whitish head that dissipates almost instantly leaving no trace. Opaque orange-red body with lots of visible, dense particulate matter. Pretty par for the course. 3

Smell - Almost like straight V8. 3

Taste - Not as good as the tamarindo picante version. While it also doesn't have the same clamato you'd find in other cheladas, there is a more noticeable sweetness than the picante version. I find the spice lacking and there's a faint but distracting off character in there, a perhaps metallic or stale corn aftertaste. 2.5

Mouthfeel - Noticably less refreshing than the tamarindo picante version. Feels a little more syrupy, and while it has some effervescence, it seems so volatile that it will dissipate before you can drink it. 2.75

Overall - I know fellow beer geeks hate the chelada style, they might see it as a bastardization of beer. But I wouldn't even call this a guilty pleasure. This is straight up an underappreciated style that I love unashamedly. However, this specific example is sub par, and doesn't even match the quality of the tamarindo picante version made by the same brewery. 2.25",2.25
Modelo Especial Chelada,"24 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 5/29/2019. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy medium reddish/orange/amber color with a foamy off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a nothing pretty quickly. Minimal lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, peppers, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, light cracker/corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of tomato juice, lime, salt, spices, and light malt notes; with big strength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, peppers, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, light cracker/corn, and herbal/grassy earthiness.

Nice robustness and balance of tomato juice, lime, salt, spices, and light malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy tomato, and fairly grainy/sticky/slick balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.5%; with minimal increasing spice heat after the finish through the glass. Overall this is a very good fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice robustness and balance of tomato juice, lime, salt, spices, and light malt flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/spicy/drying finish; nicely soft, and not overwhelming on any aspect. Well balanced tomato, lime, spices, and salt; with decent adjunct lager presence. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Liked it a lot more than I remember, one of my new favorites for a style. Used to hate tomato beers.",3.5

Notes: Labeled “FOR EXPORT ONLY”. Clear deep gold/brass in color beneath a short head of bright white. Surprisingly good head retention and lacing! Aroma of basic dull, grainy malt and generic hops. FYI, this is an adjunct beer with “Sucrose” added. Flavor follows with no exception. Short and dry finish. Medium-light in body and crisp. Overall quite dull and boring.",2.5

Bir Bintang Pilsner,"330ml bottle in a hotel in Surabaya, at INR65,000 the cheapest on the menu. I had to check the label as I initially thought the waiter had brought me a non-alcoholic version. Very little to recommend here other than the fact it can be gulped down like water, taste not dissimilar to water in fact. Boasting the colour of weak tea and a rapidly diminishing foamy head, this drink entices the nose with very little at all. The tasting doesn’t disappoint, as the hope of any flavour is dashed by its soapy blandness. If you’ve been surfing all day this stuff is probably great, but I hadn’t, and it wasn’t.",1.5

Bir Bintang Pilsner,"It has been quite the exotic couple/few days for me!

It is getting to be like my travels & travails in the Navy!

From the CAN: ""International Quality""; ""Brewed with quality ingredients""; ""For export ONLY"".

Phew! Good thing that I purchased it outside of the country or who knows what sort of punishment might have befallen me! I happily Crack!ed open the vent & then beCAN an inverted Glug that resulted in two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. I then celebrated the lovely lacing that it left in its wake. Color was a beauteous Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity, summoning forth The Gelt Gang of Croesus, Mammon & Midas for a taste. Nose was a real corn-laden downer, full of a silage-like scent that now causes me to cringe & CANtemplate heading for the hills. 8=( Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was actually rather mild, still very much in the maize, but not as pronounced as in many beers in the style. It was the kind of thing that you might not mind drinking on a hot, humid day, but it was not making it for me in the face of the cold Winter chill. If it were not for its use of corn as an adjunct, it might have been fairly pleasant, given its light flavor. Finish was semi-sweet, about on par for the style. Ho hum.

It was easy to drink without much in the way of flavour showing, some lager malts and the odd grassy flavours were about it really but I won’t complain too much since the beer serves a purpose. I can’t imagine it will be a beer I’d pick up again unless I manage to visit Indonesia, and if I do then I’ll probably end up drinking it 24/7 over there; it’s also not the worse Asian beer I’ve tried which has to count for something.",3.0

On the pour an insane 4 finger slightly fizzy head formed then slowly dissipated to a ring around the glass and some head islands floating around. Despite the style some vague lacing forms. The body is a light gold to darker straw. Carbonation is fine but active.

Smell is rough as expected a tart mistreated yeast with some light skunk. Behind that is a light crackery malt. Notch else here other than meh.

Taste is better but quite sweet with no bitterness. Some nice barley is on the palate and corn is a bit less strong, but it's normal macro. Quite drinkable and it tastes clean and a bit malty. Some cheap tartness is in there but it isn't bad.

Feel is a bit thin and dry woth a light co2 bite. There is an odd malty syrup feel at the back of the mouth despite the dryness. Still it is quite crisp and drinkable despite all that. Keep it cold.

Dos Equis Special Lager,"BB date : July 2022

Clear gold, with 3/8"" white head.

Smell is .....still waiting......still waiting...... light sweet grain, maybe a hint of fresh corn. Maybe. The aroma is pleasant, but difficult to detect.

Taste is similar to aroma , that is, barely there , slightly sweet grain, plus a hint of citrus rind (lemon), finishing with a slight corn meal flavor, that lingers....no, that's too refined for this.....sits there..... for a couple of seconds. Light bitterness. It doesn't have much taste, but it has no unpleasant flavors, so I'll bump it up .5 for that.

Feel is light, smooth, with moderate, very fine carbonation, that gives a drying finish. Said finish is pleasant, until the last instant, where it goes a half-step too far, and borders upon licking cardboard. Doesn't go all the way there though, so is well ahead of most of its brethren in this corner of beerdom. Points! ;P

I don't always drink Dos Equis, but when I do I hardly notice. ;)
Really , I've had this maybe three times previously, but not in at least fifteen years, and had no memory of the experience(s), other than it happened. It is much better than I expected.

Taste: Sweetness from the malts, corn, grain, not a lot else going on. No bitterness at all, quite bland.

Feel: Light, refreshing and smooth. It's quite drinkable for a hot day to quench a thirst.

Overall: As an easy sipper, post lawn mowing beer, it does the job. You're not expecting to get much from these mass produced, globally found Mexican lagers like Dos Equis, Sol and Corona.

Mouthfeel - Thin, very thin and watery. A complete letdown.

Overall - I drink this often because my wife likes it so it is always in the refrigerator. I don't hate it but it is a very light, one-note beer.

Tuborg Pilsner Beer (Green / Grøn),"Review: 33cl green bottle of Tuborg Pilsener (German version): ABV: ; 4.9% vol

The Germany-brewed Tuborg “Premium Quality” Pilsener. Coming in a nice looking green bottle with a rather distinctive logo. The crown representing the fact that the beer was “official court supplier of the Danish court” since 1914, as they state on their website.

For the appearance, initially looks pretty good, all sparkling with a nice head of foam and a lovely golden colour, but boy does it go all flat very quickly with the head not lasting too long.

Has a faint lagery smell, a bit malty and sweet, nothing amazing on the nose.

On taste, I got nice big mouthfuls at the start that were a bit hoppy and I could really feel the grains, not a bad initial taste.

The beer has a nice kick to it. Fruity, sweet, bitter, grainy, malty.

Taste a bit of corn as well. Not a bad tasting beer, slightly a bit too overboard with the hops perhaps, as it is a lager after all?

Not a bad tasting beer. Yeah not bad. Lagery taste with a slight kick. Bit of an aftertaste as well.
I feel the beer stops short of developing into something special, and for this reason I would like to try it again to give a better opinion. I have had it on draught and have come to the same opinion. I really am not sure if I like this beer or not, it always stumps me!",3.5

Smells of caramel, straw and dried leafes - subdued on the nose.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a gold to deep golden body beneath a finger's width of white foam. The aroma is sweetish and just lightly grainy; it's obvious that this is an adjunct beer. The hops are as expected: light, non-specific, and in the background. The flavor follows pretty closely. It's lightly sweet and threaded through with delicately spicy and herbal hop notes. There's also a delicate apple-like fruitiness to it. As far as bitterness goes there's just enough to balance it and it teeters on becoming sweet. It finishes with a drop of sweet malt and apple lingering, and then some emerging hops as the malt erodes. The head dropped fairly quickly althought plenty of fine bubbles can be seen rising steadily below. I'd say that's about average, and the lacing follows suit. In the mouth it's medium-light in body and gently crisp. All in all it's not bad for what it is.

Molson Golden,"Molson Golden is perfect beer before Oktoberfest. From when it gets hot, in N. Hemisphere, around memorial day to labor day this beer quenches your thirst, leaves a nice crisp up front flavor then a corn and hop finish. Drink this ice cold in July and August. But when September rolls around it is change to another beer. At middle of September I stock up on Oktoberfests since they are best and seasonal. Granted you can get Molson Golden all year round, and I did get a case of this in winter, but this is a summer beer. I wish Golden was a 5.5 or 5.7 at only 5%abv it is on par with Labatt blue, granted different flavors. This is a typical adjunct lager that is designed to be consumed with speed. This beer reminds me of fishing on 1000 islands in a boat which is illegal in Canada. Good times. I say 3.25 overall but certainly not ""poor"" this is a good beer and deserves respect for being a good macro. I know the men with man buns would argue that IPAs are better blah blah blah, but for an import and being a beginner beer for the 16 to 20 crowd down the tracks, or in the woods this is a tasty beer. I guess the use of corn makes it cheap too but for a Adjunct lager this is what is expected.",3.25
Molson Golden,"Drank ridiculous quantities of this in college in Rochester. Molson dominated there. We used to fill the bed of a pickup truck for bottle returns weekly. While fond memories and nostalgia drive a likely higher-than-deserved rating, I do believe this still tastes okay, and quenches the thirst, on a hot summer day.",3.5
Molson Golden,"I cannot believe I've never reviewed This old time classic.

Soo here we go.....
It couldn't be more clear gold. Watery, pale gold. Thin, scattered white foam lace.

Sweet corn and green hop with sour, yesstie aroma all over.

Subtle, clean...easy feel like water, but with fermented canned corn and wheat. Crisp bite, then smooth with a green, corn, wheat and long malty flavor. Subtle, easy, mundane.

It's a $7.00 6 pack bro!",2.5
Molson Golden,"Molson beer in Canada is better and different than what gets sent to the USA. It's a bit more hoppy, crisp and very fresh tasting with a some more bite than the US version. Even in the 1980's I had long neck bottles in Montreal and I enjoyed the light taste of Molson.",3.5

Molson Golden,"625 mL bottle from the LCBO, featuring a gaudy golden foil neck wrap and plastic shrink label, coded Mar 16 2020. I could be wrong, but I don't think Molson Golden Ale has been available (in this part of Canada, at least) since well before I was legally allowed to buy alcohol, so it seemed like a good Canada Day pick.

Pours bright, sunny golden-yellow, topped with nearly an inch of puffy, foamy white head that settles off within several minutes' time. A generously frothy collar and thin cap remain in place, with a fair amount of lace also flung about; looks great to me. I don't have too much to say about the nose - it leans toward the sweet side, with gritty, whole grain bread and pale malt sweetness making up the bulk of aroma. Hints of grassy hay and corn sugar; smells more wholesome than most macros, I suppose.

A very solid macro lager, or golden ale, or whatever you want to call it, tasting mostly of grainy pale malts and bread, with just a little bit of sweetness. Hints of grassiness towards the finish, with just a faint touch of lemon; a clean aftertaste, cleaner than Canadian for sure. Light in body, with a smooth texture and moderate carbonation levels, resulting in a very quaffable brew.

Final Grade: 3.55, a B grade. Molson Golden is a serviceable macro lager... or golden ale? Or perhaps a lagered ale? I mean, 'ale' is on the label, but that leaves plenty of room for interpretation. Whatever you want to call it, it's fine for a macro product, though I will say that the label and serving format are also kind of tacky and out of place, at least for something so uninspired... then again, I guess it's still better than a green bottle. Put this in a 12 pack of longnecks and I'd pick it over Moosehead or Molson Ex, which are currently my default ""backyard campfire"" rations.",3.75
Molson Golden,"This is the 2020 re-released version of the classic Molson Golden. I’ve had a few Goldens in the past but that was way before I joined BA. This one pours a nice beautiful golden colour. No shit. A nice head and lacing for a Molson product. The smell is grainy and corn, typical of a macro beer. Taste is ok, better than expected, but still your typical Molson product. Sweet and adjuncty. Mouthfeel is adequate, with nice bubbly action. Overall a good Molson beer if that’s saying anything.

Molson Golden,"Up here in the midwest(oH), Molson and Labatts are as cheap as just about anything the macros have to offer save keystone, or natty, and i dont typically go under the 5$ a six mark unless its a PBR. For that 5-5.99 range for a six, or 9.99 a 12, THIS IS my beer of choice!!! Very solid brew! Grain, biscut, and honey, with a clean pleasant aftertaste. It’s a little on the sweet side balance wise and for that reason I believe is a little more hangover inducing if drank in large quantities, but if you’re going for bang for your buck, taste for you buck, this lager, unlike many others in this price point, does not have any off-putting flavors or aftertaste; nothing cloying you’ll like today or hate later. It’s just a solid masspro adjunct lager that is a poundable, straight forward lager with a little earthy sweetness and just enough clean bitterness to balance it out. If it could avoid the typical whispy big cell and quickly gone head like its predecessors and competition - i’d call it damn near perfect, for what it is of course. I much prefer this over Molson Canadian, which i like but find a little more sour and bitter and less poundable than this.",3.0

Superior,A generic Mexican Lager.,2.0
Superior,"Poured from the 300mL bellita bottle (which is in fact the same beer as regular bottled superior) this bottle also says its 4.6% not 3.6%. maybe the 3.6% is alcohol by weight.

The look is like any other adjunct lager, has a light head that fizzles down over a few minutes into a few clusters of floating bubbles. Very light not a lot else going on here average carbonation. Crystal clear.

The smell is very vague, with a sweetness and hint of hops but nothing that really stands out.

The taste is similar to the smell, but with a stong corn flavor. No bitterness basically just corn with lager flavor but easy to put down and nothing necessarily offensive. Would be better if it was colder. Right at the front there is a mineral flavor that isnt the best but doesnt really get in the way. Pretty boring.

Feel is denser than you might expect, but still could be a beach beer, but not the best work beer. Maybe good for drinking on a summer night ice cold, but it better be cold. Quite sticky as it warms.

Overall it's a cheap mexican lager with a bit too much corn. Wish it had a bit more gops to balance it out. I suppose balance is the main thing it lacks. All it there is here is corn flavor and I'd appreciate it if there was something more, but if you find it for cheap in the full size I would still give it a try.",3.25

Pours a golden color with a decent fizzy head, nothing on the aroma side but you probably already assumed that.

Mouthfeel: Light but fairly full, a little cloying from the sweetness, somewhat clean and crisp but the sweetness definitely takes from that
Overall: Ehh, this isn’t terrible but it’s far from good as that sweetness really detracts from what I assume is coming with a cerveza – crisp, clean, and light.

Ultimate Oktoberfest,"1 x 12 oz Bottle
Bottled on: 07.25.2022
Glass: Snifter
Serving Temp: 59.7 F
ABV: 10.0%


Look:
The color is a slightly darker than medium but bright copper with an off-white to cream colored head. The head starts at 2 fingers high (in a snifter) the quickly dissipates to a thick ring and solid island. Good lacing is left on the glass.

Smell:
Rich toasted caramel and toffee. Vanilla, some wood, and some notes of sweet cherries. The nose is sweet, but it is very pleasant. Hops cannot be detected.

Taste:
Toasted caramel and toasted bread are joined by nice whiskey notes along with faint woody and earthy ones. Very mild hops flirt in the background with almost undetectable notes of grass. Near the end of the sip a nice warming sensation develops. The sip finishes as it begins, but with that mentioned warmth added in.

Feel:
Smooth, creamy, and a tad chewy. The body is medium to medium-full.

Overall:
A very tasty beer that is nice for a chilly (or cold) fall night. This one is a slow sipper, not one that you'd fill a half-liter or liter Masskrug and down with abandon.

This a pretty good beer. But it really isn't an amber Marzen nor a golden Festbier. It does fill a niche where you don't quite want a Backwoods Bastard or a Curmudgeon variant (if those are still brewed) and a Marzen just isn't quite enough.

Notes via stream of consciousness: So what makes this the ""Ultimate Oktoberfest""? Is it the 10% ABV or the Bourbon barrel aging, or both? Let's find out. It looks like a typical traditional Märzen with a mostly clear deep amber body beneath a short head of white foam. Unfortunately that's dropped and I haven't even raised it to give it a whiff - not so ""ultimate"" in my book. The aroma is good but I don't get a lot of Bourbon or wood, I mainly get caramelish and toasty malt and alcohol. Hmmm, maybe the taste is better? ... ... ... Yes, definitely. It's malty with a light touch of fruitiness. I'm assuming that they've used some Vienna malt here as that'll give you a touch of berry-like fruitiness. It's also bready though so there's probably some Munich malt in there as well. Caramel malt, yes, of course, and mostly golden. It's not as toasty as I thought it would be given the aroma, and there's definitely more Bourbon and oak than I was expecting as well. The alcohol, unfortunately, remains fairly clear but at the same time I expect it to at least some extent and it's not harsh or anything, just clearly noticeable. Ahh, as it warms I'm getting a little bit of a coconut note which is unexpected but quite welcome, and the malt appears more honeyish. A hint of vanilla from the oak rounds it out and the overall maltiness is quite nice. There's enough bitterness there to balance the sweetness of the malt, and just a dollop lingers in the finish. As for hop flavor there's a mild herbal note and some spiciness (unless that's the alcohol), and that also lingers in the finish shortly. I don't know that I'd call this the ""Ultimate Oktoberfest"" but it is quite good. In the mouth it's full bodied and creamy-smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation that at least partially explains the lack of head retention. The 10% ABV also explains some of that. In the end I'm thoroughly enjoying this.

Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Very good head production and decent retention. Body is a lovely reddish-amber color, crystal clear.

Very bready nose with herbal hints. It really smells like a classic Oktoberfest, except for the barrel influence - which isn't over the top. Honey, caramel, bread, bourbon, pepper, vanilla. I'm not really sure what to think of the nose, but it's certainly pleasant.

A beer like this runs the risk of being sweet to the point of cloying, but that's not really the case. The bourbon - and the high ABV, to be sure - does add a layer of sweetness, as well as tasting notes of vanilla, honey, and coconut, but there's still a bready, malty Oktoberfest here. Additional tasting notes include caramel, prune, white bread, and pumpernickel.

Fairly noticeable alcohol sting. Medium bodied. Very clean alcohol flavor that one normally gets from spirits, and seems out of place in a beer.

I can't really imagine pouring a Stein of this at an Oktoberfest celebration, but drinking a single glass at your own pace, on your own time, is a pretty rewarding experience. It doesn't all quite work, but it doesn't exactly not work, either. It's a worthy experiment, but it doesn't quite have its own niche, falling between two worlds: one of flavorful but clean lagers, and one of slow-sipping, full-bodied imperial beers. I don't know what mood I would have to be in to want another, frankly.",3.25

Looks pretty good. Crystal clear dark amber body. Small white head shrinks to a ring and faint covering, spots of lacing.

The barrel is very apparent on the nose, but smooth.

On tasting, well, just too much barrel for this palate. It's certainly smooth, but every time the base Marzen tries to assert itself, the barrel is there to kick it back down.

Mouth full, finish smooth bourbon.

Overall, personally I don't think this is a style to barrel age.",3.75
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Look blurs the line between a deep copper and ruby amber ale. Clear but not crystal clear. Very nice frothy head though.

Smell is kind of void. Whack. Honestly all I'm getting is faint sea water. A strange anomaly of a smell I've noted quite a few times before with always seemingly nothing else detectable. I wonder what the common denominator is in these beers that I smell this and nothing else. Or I'm just off?

Taste/feel. Very interesting. Definitely get the barrel right up front. Insanely, insanely dry. Flavors are very, very tame and subdued. It has tastes like a very light oktoberfest with an extra sweet element - butterscotch tbh, but not diacetyl. Apart from the overlapping barrel the beer is the farthest thing from complex ever. Its overall not that flavorful apart from the massive barrel that dick slaps you right upfront and lingers far after the finish.

Overall - and I immediately thought this as soon as it touched my lips but I wanted to jot down my notes before coming back to it - its a very nice barrel aged scotch ale. Yes, okay, it's a lager but this drank blind and 100/100 people will tell you its a scotch ale (which is an underrepresented style tbh). Overall score it tricky. I like it but don't love it. I'll happily drink the second I bought and probably buy a few more if im lucky enough to stumble upon them but won't intentionally seek out or trade for. Overall 4.25",4.25

Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Bottled on 7/25/2022. Poured into a Seidel glass. It pours a hazy, honey-amber color with a half finger of creamy, ecru-colored head and lacing. The barrel really influences the smell; the bourbon notes are subtle but distinct. There is also an unexpected grassy aroma. Only as it warms a bit do I detect the nutty caramel in the nose. The bourbon taste is very unique. Again, the bourbon influence is quite strong. But as it warms the Märzen taste emerges. It has a good, creamy mouth feel with pleasant carbonation, and it's definitely big at 10% ABV. Overall, this is one of those ""only in America"" beers. To me, the notion of an ""Imperial Märzen"" is oxymoronic and while the idea of a bourbon-barrel aged Oktoberfest is intriguing, it's also a bit gimmicky. I guess Founders has achieved its goal with this beer but I can't help but think it's messing with something sacrosanct.",3.75

Look - Pours a thick and dense off-white head that dies down pretty quickly. Clear, dark amber appearance with a lot of streaming carbonation.

Taste - The taste follows the nose with zero bitterness or alcohol taste.

Big Hoppy,"As you would expect, pours a dark black with no light shining through. Big, fluffy mocha colored head. For me, this is a big malt bomb, even though the hops are definitely there. I bought one 4 pack and honestly, that's enough for me - I have no interest in buying more. Ultimately, I found it somewhat boring and a bit of a chore to drink a 16 oz can. When it was gone I was kind of glad to see it go. By no means is it a bad beer - it's well crafted, but just not my cup of tea.",3.5
Big Hoppy,"Huge head production and fantastic retention and lacing. Body is black as ebony.

Very aromatic from the initial pour, with resinous notes along with candied orange, pine, and star fruit. Perhaps a touch of licorice and brown sugar, but very little else belying the dark roasty legs. That's not a bad thing, necessarily, as Black IPAs (IMO) should still feature the hops prominently, and this one does.

The malt base certainly makes an appearance on the palate, however. Immediately, it comes across kind of creamy and rich, almost - but not quite - like milk with powdered chocolate, or a tootsie roll. This provides a thick base for the bitter and expressive hop notes, including grapefruit, lemon, mango, resin, and pine.

The darker malt returns again on the back end, with a touch of licorice and perhaps molasses. The long-lasting aftertaste is all bitter hop oils.

This is an interesting Black IPA. It's remarkably balanced between the hops and malts. It somehow seems to emphasize the latter without coming across like a hoppy stout; it's still very much an IPA, but the hop flavors aren't quite as explosive (and certainly not as modern) as I would expect. I'm not sure which varietals are in play, but it reminds me more of SNPA and Founders Centennial than Tree House - so, I'm expecting classic PNW hops.

This is really delicious, even if nothing is screaming for attention. Lawson's made a big Black IPA verging on imperial strength that is somehow subtle and restrained.",4.0

This pours black like a full stout. A really impressive tan head with hills sits on top and laces the whole session through.
The aroma is muted by the impressive head, but later on in the session there is caramel with fruity hops pushing through. Still subtle though.
The taste is all malt in the front. Chocolate, charcoal, Milard reaction. There is a hop finish (thank you). I dries things out and gives a little hint of fruit but frankly it's not enough to really call this a n IPA.
Mouthfeel is medium, with an illusion to stickiness, and carbonation is appropriate.
A little more hop hit at the finish would make this an amazing beer. As a lover of dry beers though, I like it.",3.75
Big Hoppy,"Pours black with a creamy tan colored head; pretty vigorous and quick formation, as it settles there is plenty of lacing left behind, full film lacing on side opposite of drinking…some great retention too.

This is definitely a black ipa, the hops jump out of the glass. There is an underlying dankness to this beer with very pleasant hints of evergreen and damp earthy forest air and just the slightest hint fruity grapefruit; underneath it all is some roastiness with minor notes of coffee. Smelled a good 5 minutes before taking a sip…

Oh boy! What a shot of resiny hoppy goodness. This is like biting into a hop cone hugely grapefruit forward with a substantial sappy pine note. Much like the nose it’s all hops first; aftertaste and finish is very roast forward and comes off as more a bitter dark chocolate than the coffee expected from the nose.

Medium body; a smoother than expected carbonation, almost creamy. Huge bitterness on the finish both hop and roast driven. Lingering dry and resiny feel tingles on the tongue long after the sip is gone. Minor hint of warming form the abv.",4.25

Big Hoppy,"This was poured into an English pint glass. The appearance was a black color with a one finger off white to white foamy head that dissipated in rings at a nice pace. Clingy ringy lace. The aroma starts off with sharp roasted malts with a decent resinous bitter hoppiness coming across huge. Dark chocolate. Resinous pine come forth more as it warms. The flavor resides in the bitterness component of the resinous pine, sharp and embracing with a roasted to bitter aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable to sipping quality behind it. Resinous bitter edges hit hard enough to claim the style. Overall, damn nice Black IPA that I could have again.",4.25

Smell and taste as advertised; pine resin, some grapefruit rind, classic west coast IPA profile. Pretty hoppy/bitter. Medium body, medium carbonation, but smooth mouthfeel. IMO, not nearly as nice as their 25th anniversary offering. At the price I probably won't revisit this one, unless I buy a single can to reconfirm my initial impression.",4.0

Not sticky and moderate feel. Quite smooth once the sharpness settles down as it warms.",4.0
26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Canned on 8/9/2022 so approximately 5 weeks old when reviewed. Poured into a pint glass. It pours a bright, clear golden honey color with more than a finger of creamy, eggshell-colored head and thick, soapy lacing. Lots of bubbles ascend the glass. The smell features floral hops with notes of lemon peel, grapefruit, and onion. This is a classic West Coast IPA with very bitter citrus and biting Centennial hops. There is also a strong malty backbone but there is almost no sweetness at first. However, as the ale warms in the glass I begin to taste some balancing caramel - although it never overcomes the stringent bitterness. This ale has a moderate mouthfeel with fairly lively carbonation and at 9.7% ABV it has great substance. Overall, if you enjoy an old school West Coast IPA with huge bitter citrus and modest malt presence, then you should seek out 26 Anniversary Imperial IPA while it's available. Really enjoyable! As a bonus, it should age fairly well in the can so don't be put off by the canning date if you haven't tried it yet.",4.25

26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Fairly dark coppery body, perfectly crystal clear. Excellent head production and decent retention.

Quite a bit of toasted malt on the nose, crackery and grainy, not unlike a massive amber ale. Naturally, it's dosed with a hefty ration of hops, with notes of pine, bark, candied orange, and grapefruit peel. I wouldn't say it's a dead ringer for a near-10% ABV version of Stone IPA, but the pedigree is certainly evident.

Flavor follows. It's a bitter bomb through and through, equally bold in presentation of hops and malt. Strong semi-sweet notes of caramel, bread, and brown sugar are balanced by orange, pine, honey, leather, and grapefruit peel.

There's some heft to the malt body that belies the boozy strength, and a bit of alcohol bite, but this drinks incredibly smooth. An excellent beer, insanely drinkable for the ABV. Nothing particularly new, but a near perfect reinvention of a classic style.",4.5

26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"A dark but shiny amber brew arrived in a pint glass, yes a pint glass, after drawn from a tap. Its white head is modest, but enduring. Sweet malt and soft piney hop aromas merge above the glass. This drinks richly and smoothly, but there is an alcohol bite with it and the esophagus feels the burn. The balance between malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness is a great one. At the onset this almost tastes too sweet, as at the alcohol seems to exaggerate the maltiness. The wonderful balance is best noticed midway through. During the finish the alcohol manages to amplify the bitterness of the hops. The hopping can best be described as piney and resinous. As with many high octane ales, the glass lacing is sparse. Despite its qualities, one pint will be enough for one sitting.",4.25

It has some of your usual West Coast IPA suspects (pine, citrus, grapefruit, etc). In my opinion tastes a little dank. It has a medium body, not all malty and chewy. It goes down easy. It is not too boozy tasting, but the alcohol becomes very obvious about 1/2 way though the beer. I LOVE dry hopped (or double dry hopped) beers so I was excited for this, however I am not a huge Centennial fan. So for me, this is not one I will be buying more of.

26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Scaling up and scaling out, Stone gets a little retrospective as they head into year number twenty seven. Looking to the quarter of a century in the making of their flagship IPA, Stone Brewing goes and turns it up to 26.

Doubling down on that IPA, Stone 26th Anniversary Imperial IPA catches the eye with its finely hazy deep golden appearance. Glowing softly, the scent starts to grow with a peppery dankness laced with citrus and hints of stone fruit. All wrapped in a caramelized cocoon of malt, the scent soon gives way to a malty-sweet upstart of light toast, granola and floral suggestions of honey.

A quick transition toward bitterness happens as soon as the ale splashes the middle palate where its malt sweetness starts to dissolve and the floral potpourri and citronella of the nose turns crisp and fruity with pink grapefruit, bitter orange and a hint of jammy apricot. Turning the corner in the final frame, the fruits develop a bitterness of pith and peel while the resinous nature of pine, grasses and botanicals create a dry and bitter late palate.

Stone 26 is a dedicated bitter bomb that'll have the tastebuds crying for mercy. Full bodied, dankly resinous and gripping the gullet with its strong hop bite, Finishing decidedly on the bitter side of bitter-sweet the session concludes with a long and spicy bitterness of pinesol and peppery hemp. ...but in a good way.",4.5

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not really sure what to think of this. Another juicy IPA from Sierra? What makes it different? There's nothing on the label but it is 7.0%ABV. It's poured a very hazy golden body with an orange sheen beneath a finger's width of white foam that's holding well. There are both larger and smaller bubbles in the head which is a good sign, and I can see very fine bubbles rising through the particulate in suspension below. The aroma offers tropical notes of orange, mango, distant pineapple, and some woodiness, a light grassiness, and a hint of pine. The taste offers much more woodiness, grassiness, and pine within a fairly wide maltiness. It's not exactly rich, there's not enough there, nor really complex, but it's more complicated than the basic malt that a lot of brewers are using for juicy IPAs. I don't think it's wheat but I could be wrong, and I'm thinking there's some rye there but I think that's because the woody, grassy, and piney hops are suggesting that. I definitely believe are some oats involved as I can taste them. It's an unusual maltiness but I'm not sure how well I actually like it. I think I prefer the more basic malt that lets the hops do their own thing without interference. Anyway, there's less fruit than I thought there would be, and I'm thinking that mango is the dominant note. Of course people taste things differently from each other, and even different from themselves on certain days so who knows. A firm bitterness balances it and it finishes mainly dry with the woody, grassy, and piney hops lingering. It's almost spicy; the woodiness is kind of like cedar. That makes me think of either Sorachi Ace or Sabro hops but neither of those check out in terms of what else they bring to the table so I'm confused as to what they might be using. It's a little floral as well, which I get in the finish. Meh, I'm not blown away by it but it is well brewed. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp-then-smooth. All in all it's decent enough but I'm just not a fan of the recipe. I thought it would be more ""juicy"" as it's labeled as a ""JUICY IPA"" but I do like the spicy woodiness.

Liquid Hoppiness,"12 oz. can, PKGD 07/05/22 stamped on the bottom of the can. From the 12 pack case; my first review on BeerAdvocate in over 5 years, but i digress.. and alas,

Poured into a Piraat snifter.

A - Pours a crisp fruity orange juice color, with little over a finger of frothy head with lingering lace. Looks excellent.

S - Smell is fresh, fruity, tropical, floral. Very miiiild alcoholic scent is present when you look for it, as are some pale bread malts. Stone fruits. Smells fresh, above all else.

T - Taste brings in much of the same: citrusy orange juice, acidity, & a mild warming alcoholic bite.

F - Smooth, crisp, easy-drinking. Bitter & dry in the finish, which beckons you for another sip. Highly drinkable stuff for sure, one could easily crush three or four or five of these in a session.

Overall, a nice drinkable sessionable beer; though typical of the style. I'd call it a slightly above average though not amazing beer. 7/10 would drink again, which will come out to

Sierra Nevada Liquid Hoppiness IPA -----3.5/5",3.5
Liquid Hoppiness,"Poured from a 12oz can stamped 07/20/22 to a Nonic at fridge temp.
This pours hazy light gold but not hazy enough to hide the many many rising bubbles near the glass wall. Despite an average pour I got a large pillowy white head. I had to be patient to get the full 12oz in a 16oz glass. The head lasts quite long, though not the entire session. Lacing is impressive.
The aroma is a little musty and fruity, but almost goes away completely after a few minutes. Sniff early with this one.
The taste is somewhat fruity, but not amazing. Alcohol makes itself known on the finish, this may be a reflection of the almost 2-month age of this can.
Mouthfeel is light for the style and carbonation is on the other end of the scale.
Not bad, but not impressive. Hopefully I will come back and edit this review if I catch a fresh can.",3.5
Liquid Hoppiness,"12 oz can from a 6pk poured into a pint glass.

L - Pours a slightly hazy straw-orange color with carbonation and some murkiness throughout. Almost a bit of sediment present but maybe the glass isn't 100% clean. A good finger of bright white head that dissipates leaving a moderate lacing.

S - Faint citrus, honey, malt, slightly hoppy, mostly orange and pineapple coming through with a typical SN Pale Ale aroma. Nothing overpowering or standout.

T - Follows the nose with lots of citrus rind and pineapple. Slightly astringent alcohol in the middle, a decent hoppy bite, not one I'd consider ""juicy"" compared to others but on the sweeter IPA side. Finished with a little bready malt to balance it out.

F - Light-to-medium bodied, lightly moderate carbonation, slightly wetter finish but drinkable for a 7% ABV.

O - Picked this up as a big fan of SN's offerings, the design, and interest in ""juicy"" IPAs. While I wouldn't classify this is as particularly ""juicy"", it's drinkable, fairly balanced, and decently priced for a 6pk. Not sure I'd pick it up again but a valiant effort from Sierra Nevada.",4.0

Liquid Hoppiness,"Enjoying my first poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. can. Gentler in the body and the hoppiness when compared to Sierra Nevada pale ale and their Torpedo strong IPA. Lighter in the mouthfeel than both as well and, as such, is more drinkable than both, in my opinion (and I like both). They label it a “juicy IPA” but I don’t find it overly citrusy and, in fact, picked up on interesting spice notes in the aroma. You don’t have to be a hophead to love this beer which is refreshing. I don’t mind aggressively hopped IPAs (usually) but I prefer a cleaner finish with less lingering bitterness at the back of the tongue (Stone IPAs) like I find here. Would love to try a draught pint of this brew. Pleasantly surprised by this blind purchase. Nice job, Sierra Nevada!",4.0
Liquid Hoppiness,"12oz can.

Pours clear yellow with a chill haze. Moderate retention and lacing. Mild aromatics of pineapple, melon, and apple. Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. Pineapple with grapefruit on the palate with minimal malt and a balancing bitterness. Finishes dry but not juicy.",3.75
King AL,"Pineapples, and mangos, and oranges oh my!! This stuff pours the most gorgeous opaque murky light yellow. Was there some dry-hopping involved here hahaha? Aromas are fruits and citrus all the way. Flavors are as mentioned initially and in spades. Ridiculously creamy and smooth mouthfeel and zero alcohol detected. Tried to drink this slowly and failed. Great collab!",4.75
King AL,"Had it on draft and poured from a 32oz growler. Purchased at Dallas Craft Beer Cellar.

It pours beautifully looks excellent in a glass, aroma is there, lots of fruit citrus and tropical, dankiness, union, slightly sweet but it's all balanced out right. Hops shine properly. Lovely creamy thick chewy body and slight bitterness that comes through on the finish with some low amount of prickly carbonation. The finish lingers nicely. The beer keeps you wanting another sip.

Can't detect any alcohol whatsoever. This is a very nice beer just about perfect in my books I couldn't say a single negative thing about it. I believe it's the best NEIPA I have had in a while. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes NEIPAs.

I'd love to see some more collabs between these breweries.",4.75
King AL,"First saw this when i received an email from Half Time. Looked really interesting to me as I like both brewers. My highest rated beer was a collaboration between Toppling Goliath and Tree House. I would think that this brew would be a similarly great collaboration. Was please to learn that it was available at Empire liquors. I walk into “the good beer section” of the cooler and I cannot find it. The beer guy walks in and points in me in the direction of the last 4 pack. It is mine!

Brewers Notes: King AL uses a mashed-up grain bill from MC² and Toppling Goliath’s King Sue before introducing Equilibrium’s absolute biggest dry-hop to date with an all Citra Incognito, Citra LUPOMAX, Citra Cryo and Citra T-90 hop bill. Pouring a milky opaque yellow with aromas of mango sorbet and orange creamsicle, we get chewy saturated flavors of tropical smoothie, fresh squeezed navel orange juice, dank grass, fruit salad in syrup and lime gummies with a thick and custard like creamsicle finish and a huge blast of EQjuice rainbow melon flavors. King AL is dangerously soft and smooth and may have you questioning the laws of physics, space, time or just how we got a melted orange creamsicle fruit bomb into the can.

Chilled can poured into a spiegelau ipa glass . Pale hazy honey colored liquid topped by a creamy white one finger foam cap , reduces to a thick layer and leaves some spotty lacings.

Aroma is orange citrus, faint whiff of mango

Taste is juicy orange citrus, cantaloupe, papaya, apricot, fruit salad, hint of lime

Mouthfeel is smooth, even, flavorful , low sudsing, hop taste, no bite

Good beer , recommended",4.5

King AL,"Canned on 8/29/22; consumed on 9/21/22

Pours a turbid, baby food-orange body capped with just shy of two fingers of rich, white foam; decent head retention leaves a vague, paper-thin layer of cap, thin, frothy collar, and healthy spatter of soapy, webby lacing sprayed across the walls of the glass.

Aromas burst with a ripe, tropical overload, bringing guava, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine juice into subtle dankness with boggy resins interspersed; lemon gummies accent mango, while shreds of onion deepen an oncoming herbaceousness through the close.

Taste shows orange zest, guava, and juicy papaya upfront, with a slight onion interlude over the mid-palate easing to sweet malts countered late by a delayed, earthy prickle of resins and grass as onion continues to linger through notes of citrus zest on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a body on the fuller side of medium with a subdued, moderate carbonation, leaving an almost soupy density and gritty resins for contrast; briefly taut through the mid-palate as a juicy build leaves a silky back end and finish.

A sampling of the purest variety across the hop spectrum; diverse, intriguing, and complete in expressing myriad tropical undertones atop a resinous, quasi-bitter base; a sippable coalescence for the hop-inclined senses.",4.25
King AL,"The color is perfect. Golden sunflower honey sunshine yellow. Just how I like it. Minimal foam, which quickly disappears. The smell is strong. Mango, orange, papaya, and honeydew scents are clear. The flavor is a true hybrid of Toppling Goliath Brewing and Equilibrium Brewery at their finest. It has the electric butter of Toppling Goliath Brewing, with the mango candy of Equilibrium Brewery. It tastes like a sweeter version of King Sue. It is delicious. Flavors of mango, orange, papaya, and honeydew come through, just like with the scent. The mouthfeel is soupy, juicy, smooth, and full. The carbonation is light. Overall, this is a very delicious NEIIPA. One of the best.",4.5
Oktoberfest,"12 ounce bottle, freshest by 11/26/22 stamped on the label. Thanks to Brutaltruth for this brew! Served in a dimpled mug, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with not quite an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like bready malt and floral/grassy hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of grainy/sweet malt, apple and some caramel flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!",3.75
Oktoberfest,"Glassware: 0.5 L Festmug
Temp at Pour: 50.4


Look:
Nice medium and clear copper. Initial 2-finger off white head appears creamy and dissipates very slowly to a thickness of a single finger.

Smell:
Nice toasted bread notes along with earthy grains and hints of toffee and a touch of caramel. The noble hops provide notes of grass with a touch of fresh hay and some light floral notes as well.

Taste:
Sweet bready malts and toasted toffee/caramel start things off and are quickly met by the grassy hops that provide a very mild spice and balance the sip out. Some note of pumpernickel or rye float around in the background with a faint nuttiness. The sip finishes dry, a tad toasty, and mildly spicy. The flavors might be toned down compared to some other Märzens but they are impeccably balanced. The high ABV (for the style) is not noticeable.

Feel:
Clean and smooth. Almost creamy. Body is medium-light.

Overall:
I was looking forward to trying this and am glad that I did. Troegs did not disappoint. This is a nice, very easy-drinking amber Märzen. It is going down very quickly. Is it as good as the German staples (Paulaner, HP, Ayinger, Spaten)? Nope. But it is quite good regardless. This will become part of my annual Oktoberfest rotation. I am glad that I picked up a six pack (so far). I'll be going back for more.

The use of Pilsner and Munich malts w/o any Caramel malt was an interesting choice. I think that it works. The lack of Caramel malt is likely what contributes to the toned down flavors (esp malts and toastiness) but it does make the beer more quaffable and lets the dryness come through more distinctly.",4.0
Oktoberfest,"12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug.
Freshest by 11/30/22

Very clear copper pour with a decent off-white cap. Moderate strength malty nose, bread and honey mostly. Flavor wise, it’s toasty and somewhat spicy but more herbal, some caramel, only mildly sweet with like bitterness. It strikes an overall balance right through to the finish. Aftertaste is earthy /woody. Mouthfeel is medium weight and a little slick but not creamy.

Oktoberfest,"Full disclosure, I poured a 12 oz bottle into a liter stein, so my notes may be off. Troegs' Oktoberfest entry pours a transparent amber with a white head. The nose is of no surprise, malt. I was disappointed with how light the flavor was. The body is smooth and inoffensive. Again, I'm thinking the pour may have something to do with my results.",3.25
Oktoberfest,"Poured from the bottle into a Libbey style pilsner glass.

Beautiful looking festbier, with light visible carbonation and a khaki to orange mixed colored head which is superfine. Body color is a golden amber, nearly orange bronze mix which is shiny and glimmering. Very good looking brew.

Quite a neat aroma. Clean sensing but a distinct emphasis on malt that goes with a mix of caramel and distinct milk chocolate as well. Light touches of herbal hop and even a bit of nutty sensations too. Very nice.

Palate fits real nicely. Milky sensations of cream and caramel, with a toasty aroma and hops to match. Light herbal presence not just in the finish but in the mid palate too for excellent malt contrasts. Creamed caramel and milk chocolate seem to be even more pronounced as well, with a robust mouthfeel. Superior clean finish, and even manages to stay dry.

Great brew.",4.25
Oktoberfest,"The pour is copper colored with a fair amount of carbonation. The taste is caramel, roasted pine nuts, & a soft earthy herbal note. If I never heard of Troegs brewing I would have could have easily confused this with a Wartsteiner or Hacker Pschorr Oktoberfest beer. Cheers! B",4.0

L: polished-clear, tawny-amber liquid; finger-high foam build on pour, collapsing into thin cap... only a thin, crescent collar remains; very little lace

S: lightly-sulfured, herbaceous pretzel crust; a malt aroma rich in depth and dimension; grainy up top, doughy below... nutty and apple-y highlights... slight accent of noble hops; little alcohol presence, just an overtone

T: doughy, moderately-toasty foundation, big and round malts unfloding with each sip... grassy bitter top note in the aftertaste, accompanied by some salty pretzel crust at the back and sides... lingering chewy bread crust essence... missing a small amount of lasting depth or nuance

F: near plush in its texture, mildly inflated core; little latent carbonation... I did drink this relatively 'warm', so maybe it gassed off too much... the alcohol and hops team to stoke a mild heat at the back of the palate... despite its faintly flabby feel, it drinks really darn quick with a soft touch of residual malt sludge

O: they did not disappoint with this; it's pretty much how I wished a few of the other 'big-name' local breweries would've made their O'Fest... worthy of purchase in bulk (2012)",4.25

I was expecting this to be overly hoppy for the style as most Tröegs beers are, but I would say they cut off just at the right time. Any more and it would ruin the beer.

Oktoberfest,"Canned on 7/21/22; consumed on 9/20/22

Pours a clear, orange-copper body topped with a finger and a half of fluffy, off-white foam; mediocre head retention leaves a paper-thin layer of cap, a large, frothy collar, and a modest array of splotchy, webby lacing strewn along the walls of the glass.

Aromas show sweet caramel malts laden with honey-soaked toast and bits of more toffeed malt as corn flakes soften the otherwise taut edges of minerality prevalent throughout.

Taste of caramel and taut minerality feed into more passive honeyed dough as shreds of corn flakes past the mid-palate leave a stuff sweetness while simultaneously unable to shake the metallic tinge lingering through the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a clean, fluffy prickle to a crisp mid-palate drying quickly with minimal grit through a swift finish.

Detailed sweetness belies a largely clean presentation, leaving a readily apparent lack of cohesion in a rough fusion of disparate elements and choppy lager threads; the lazily saccharine base instinct of the American Oktoberfest is prominent in this particular take on the style.",3.25
Oktoberfest,"Competitive price point on the 12 pack, considering it was shelved next to various variations ; most of which i have tried, the best in the style imo being Von Trapp. Pours a lighter than your average marzen copper color, little head retention or head. about average. light on the lacing. taste seems to style, nothing to jump for joy about. picked up because of the better price point for a 12 pack of cans, would purchase again. pretty mediocre and perhaps even lower in quality when compared to yuengling.

Is it smooth with the right carbonation? etc… etc… A great lager has you wanting to take another big sip.. It doesn’t have you bored… thinking to yourself, “should have I went with another offering?” This is arguably the best American made marzen I’ve had outside the one from the American lager masters in Cleveland!

Overall: Malty and smooth with honey and caramel. A decent amount of spice. Sweet bread, caramel, and malty flavors, but the spice is muted. Malty, but not overly roasted like you might expect from some. Still, shas that phenolic and alcoholic flavor cloying sweetness. That said, it's pretty good, but not what I remember from previous years. (Final Rating: 3.73)",3.75
Oktoberfest,"Solid stuff here, very impressed when I tossed this in the mix with some perennial favorites of the style. Beautiful dark copper pour with a great pillow of white foam and great lacing. Both aromas and flavors are well balanced malty/crackery goodness with a just slightly dry finish. A bit much on the carbonation level is my only complaint. Well done.",4.25
Oktoberfest,"Nice beer, enjoyed on tap along the Mississippi River.",4.0
Oktoberfest,"For a brewery that enjoys moving the needle and pushing boundaries when it comes to beer, Toppling Goliath shows tremendous restraint in making a time honored, classic and traditional fest beer.

Their Oktoberfest pours with a frothy deep gold with strikingly bright clarity. As a stark white froth builds toward the brim, the nose fills with a light and savory scent of fresh bread, nuttiness, crust and a bright and floral bouquet. Leading with malt flavors, the initial sip is juicy with bready sweet flavors accented with bread crust, cashew, croissant and biscotti.

With the malt sweetness staying ahead of the pack, the flavors are met with a light hop fruitiness that develops into a spicy and light bitterness that simply takes an edge off of the lingering malts. Lightly grassy, peppery and bright, the hops take the session into an even keel balance and a snappy finish.

Medium-light in its body, the beer trends drier than most with a brisk mineral bite and a racy sense of carbonation that gives the beer a pop on the late palate but doesn't settle with the elegance or smoothness of more classic Germanic varieties. Still, its a delicious American rendition to America's favorite fall beer style.",4.0
Oktoberfest,"Pours a gorgeous copper color with a creamy oatmeal colored beer that sticks around as a cap and provides moderate lacing. Beautiful beer, IMHO.

The nose features sharp caramel notes and biscuits as soon as the top is popped, and a nice wheat bread component that works really well.

The taste is led by the caramel flavor, and there’s a nice biscuit flavor and some bread that tamps down the sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium, but a bit soft and watery, which is a bit of a miss, IMHO.

This is still a worthy fall beer that I’ll enjoy through the 4-pack, but if that mouthfeel had been a bit more dialed in, this would be a “run back to the beer store for more” Marzen.",3.75
Oktoberfest,"Canned on 7/19/22 (best by 1/15/23); consumed on 9/13/22

Pours a clear, ruddy orange body capped with two fingers of fluffy, off-white foam; decent head retention yields a tinge of creamy cap, a large, frothy collar, and generous display of webby, soapy lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.

Aroma features a tinge of earthy spice into toasty honey and a brown bread undercurrent as spritzy minerality leans into soft bread dough over time.

Taste offers toasted malts and a prickly minerality, with a blunter burnt honeycomb mid-palate engaging flaky bread crusts on the back end as delicately charry bread dough finishes.

Mouthfeel brings a light body and a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; cleanly textured into a pillowy peak through the mid-palate, a slight prickle trends dry into a refreshing finish.

A softly dispositioned Märzen, finding honeyed malt easing a light sweetness across a vaguely mineralic, largely airy foundation; a solid overall take on the style nonetheless.",3.5

Poured into my pint glass this lager is a clear brassy amber shade with a cake like ecru colored head. Streams of bubbles rising.

Scent is caramel, bread dough and crisp herbal hops.

Taste is dry and spicy. There is a hint of caramel and some crackery or biscuity malt but the peppery earthy spice and herbal hop notes take center stage. Considerably more dry than sweet. Some tart apple notes appear as the beer warms.

Mouth is crisp and bracing. Surprisingly refreshing.

This is really an interesting marzen. Very dry and much less malty / sweet than most examples of the style. Refreshing and very easy to drink with a classic German style hop profile and nice clean finish. Very high drinkability. I love the subtlety and the crisp nature of this lager. Still think Ayinger and Hacker are my favorites but this is pretty high on my list .",4.25

T: The taste follows the smell and has a light to moderate amount of bitterness.

The taste is semisweet caramel malt up front with more traditional bread and noble hop notes coming after the swallow. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, good. I'd prefer way less sweetness and no caramel malt.",3.5
Oktoberfest,"Definitely a bit lighter than some of the heavier amber marzens. Packs a nice crackery wallop with a handful of zesty, earthy hops. Super refreshing and what I look for in an oktoberfest. Love the lightness, grassiness, slight bitterness and overall cracker flavor.

Emperor Julius,"Pours a turbid orange color with an egg white colored head that is creamy and leaves thick lacing rings down the glass. Magnificent looking hazy, IMHO. The nose is rife with dank ripe oranges and mango, with some pineapple and melon as well.

The taste is focused on the ripe orange and mango flavors, with some melon and pineapple for kicks. There is zero discernible alcohol, quite impressive for an 8.8% ABV beer.

The mouthfeel features that trademark full, pillowy Tree House mouthfeel that keeps reeling you in for another sip. If you enjoy hazies (and I do), Tree House is your Holy Grail. World class stuff, IMHO.",4.5

Emperor Julius,"Ever think you've had too many IPA's and then you find one that makes you realize that you haven't tried everything worth having?

Yeah, this was one of those beers.

One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases. All were solid, as was this, was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family. Poured like orange juice, felt like orange, juice, and had possibly the best head and lacing that I've ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet. Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste. Loads of dewy forest, dank hops, apricot, stone fruit, turbid orange, and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same. So smooth, so fun, and so easy to fall in love with, this had a nice body, hints of wheat in the taste, and went down *way* too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste.

I have no idea how this was 8.8% ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun. Dated 8/24 on the bottom of the can with ""IT IS YOUR DESTINY"" written above it, the Star Wars reference was fun, just like the rest of this outstanding brew. Use the force, or whatever it takes, to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years!",4.5

Nose is a wonderful hoppy orange, peach and mango. Taste follows nose with the flavor muted a bit compared to aroma. Just enough bitterness to balance the beer, but not bitter as a sister beer like Juice Machine. A nice hop flavor rides the taste to an easy finish.

Festbier,"Clear gold appearance with an average size white head. Grainy, malt focused aroma that does a good job of whetting my appetite with limited input from the hops.

Festbier,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. This Bostonian Festbier pours a bit more deep golden than typical and offers a light and brief cap of foam. Nose is grainy yet lacks much in the hops department. Touch of lemony hops with a spin.

Taste offers a malty yet subdued delivery for the style, lacking the depth of a typical malt bill. Decent feel yet not much depth as the malt is singular. Bit of spice on the finish. Just...bland.

Overall I usually like the Sam seasonals but this seems to be a work in progress. Good to see more festbiers in the States but this is undercarbonated and lacks malt depth and ends overly sweet and simple. Festbier like Pils is so simple to make yet nobody wants to make it Stateside without forcing two row into the mix. It doesn't work. Respect beer and respect beer styles.

Smell:
Bready dough with a hint of lemon. Noticeable grassy and earthy hops.

Lightly toasted bread and biscuity notes with touches of lemon. More malty than the aroma suggests. Notes of grass and earth are in the background. The sip dries a tad at the end. Nice.

Festbier,"Appearance: A large, moderately coarse snow-white head with good retention. The medium golden body show a bit of haze, with clouds of fat bubbles drifting lazily to the surface. Scattered bits of foam adorn the glass wall.

Aroma: The aroma offers bread dough notes, cracker malts and pleasant noble hops.

Taste: At the opening, bready malt notes appear, soon followed by grassy and peppery hop flavors. A bit of sweetness presents later in the taste. Towards the finish, there is a mild wave of herbal bitterness, bringing the taste to a graceful close.

Mouth feel: Soft and full, very pleasant, with just a bit of soft carbonation.

Drinkability/notes: A fine example, perhaps a bit out of season for December, but, nonetheless, well done.

Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a La Fin du Monde tulip.",3.75
Festbier,"12oz bottle

Pours about a finger of dense white head into my Boston Lager glass. Retention is very nice, with most of the head remaining after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks pretty nice as well. Body is a brilliant golden orange. Looks great so far.

Nose is a nice blend of cracker, and doughy-toasty notes, with a bit of malty sweetness. Smells great.

Flavor follows suit, although maybe even cleaner, and definitely fuller. That dough comes through wonderfully. Super clean, great flavor.

Even after a little while in the glass, the carbonation is still holding up well, medium-light. Body is pretty light but there is a small sweetness that adds a little depth. Bitterness is low, but definitely shows itself. Really a lovely, soft mouthfeel that accentuates that doughy sweetness.

Drinkability is super high, this is tasty and very well balanced.

Appearance turned out ok, the head faded and the lacing was subpar, but not bad all around.

This is what I want out of a Festbier, this has that extra doughy sweetness you need to separate the style from a more generic lager, something many Festbiers fail to do. Overall a great beer.",4.25
Festbier,"A deep golden color, darker than the previous Weihenstephan Festbier, but quite good looking - clear with plenty of tiny rising bubbles below a tall white thick head that has good retention, receding below a domed top.

The aroma grassy, bready, and earthy.

The taste is much better. Malty with a bit of brightening from the hops. Bread and a touch of caramel. It is, as the label says, very smooth and mild. Eminently drinkable, malty but not too sweet. It seems to me to be a bit of an in-between styles beer (i.e. between a Märzen and a Festbier rather than a true Festbier). I would guess Sam Adams was not wanting to stray too far from their very popular Oktoberfest.

The mouth feel is substantial, smooth, and creamy.

Overall, an enjoyable beer, one I could have several of in a ""session"", but lacking the crispness of the best festbiers I've had. Nevertheless, and we'll see how I feel after trying (for the first time) the Sam Adams Oktoberfest tomorrow, but I could see buying 6 packs of this. At this point, I'm sorry to have only 2 left.

Glass: 0.5 L Festmug
2022-Sep-18


Look:
Clear and bright golden yellow with a 2 finger rocky head. The head quickly faded to nothing, likely due to the glass not being clean (it was my 2nd beer at the 'Fest)

Smell:
Spicy and floral hops that almost come across as citrusy. Almost. Light bready malts are hiding in the background but are definitely there.

Taste:
Follows the nose/aroma. The light malts are biscuity and even a tad cracker-like. The finish is on the dry side.

Feel:
Crisp and clean but also soft. The body is light-medium or even a shade lighter.

Overall:
A decent Festbier that is insanely quaffable and perfect for a warm day (like today was for a time). This brew is very much like a (slightly) amped-up Helles with some Pilsner hops/bitterness.

Look:
Clear golden yellow with a 4-finger frothy and pillowy white head. The head very slowly fades to about a 1 finger of bubbly foam. Lacing is excellent.

Smell:
Mildly Bready and slightly grainy. There is a very light touch of lemon and also of uncut grass. A mild zest is present as well.

Taste:
Very similar to the nose with an extra lightly tart note in there. The sip finishes slightly dry but nowhere near bitter.

Feel:
Crisp and soft. Body is just about light-medium

Overall:
A light, mellow, and easy drinking Festbier. This is very much like a (slightly) amped-up Helles. I prefer Festbiers with more flavor and body, like Tucher, or a Dortmunder like Augustinerbräu-Munchen Edelstoff (which has been served at the Munich Oktoberfest in the past) but this is nice for warmer weather.

Weihenstephaner Festbier,"I would have rated this beer perfectly, however, perfection only exists in dreams, so in a rational sense I rate it nearly perfect.

I've been drinking German beer since 1977, and this by far is arguably, in my experience anyway, the best Lager period... It is important to ensure it's fresh.

I'm a fan of Marzen type beer, malty lagers that pack a punch, but are smooth and balanced. I've tried most of all the offerings by European brewers since about 2000 (when I discovered Marzens) and this beer repeatedly beats them all! Hofbrau's Marzen several years ago was also OUTSTANDING...on par or better then this, but last year they cheapened it, and the carnage is again the theme with Hofbrau's version this year. I will never understand this! Hofbrau if you are reading this BE ASHAMED! If you need to charge more because your costs have risen DO SO! Don't make it cheaper!!

The beer is crisp, clear, maintains a nice head ALL THE WAY down in your glass. Alas, let's not forget the flavor is IN THE HEAD, hence why when beer performs like this it retains it's crisp, carbonated flavor all the way down. This beer also leaves generous lacings on your glass, and it's a beautiful beer to behold,. Simply near perfect! If you're a fan of the Marzen style, I invite you to try it out. Just be sure it is fresh.",4.75

Taste: Kicks off with bready malt and a big bouquet of floral goodness – black locust, flowering cherry, and yellow azalea amongst them and followed by a rich doughy punch. Bread, honey, biscuits, and flowers play tug-of-war until floral hops regain dominance on the close
Mouthfeel: Light but full, extremely clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a clean and crisp but slightly soft finish
Overall: This is some tasty stuff. I love this beer and am totally biased towards it but it’s hard not to be with how well-made and delicious it is. A Festbier through and through and one of the gold standards at that with plenty of malt, bread, and dough along with a floral hoppy side that shines in these lighter-styled Oktoberfests.

Weihenstephaner Festbier,"Sampling a lightly chilled 11.2 oz bottle poured into my .5L dimple mug. Been meaning to get to this since Oktoberfest, just havent opened it. Date code is 0201 16:55:09.
The beer pours a bright clear golden straw color with a fizzy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up. This foam fades to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour. Several active streams of carbonation rise to the surface to feed the foam.
Aroma is some cracker malt and a bit of light honey note. Nose is very mild overall.
First sip reveals a light body with smooth texture and very mild carbonation.
Flavor is some bready malt and crackers, a bit of honey again and here I get some spicy or black tea hops that linger with a little bitterness after each swallow. Finish is sort of dry and the beer drinks very easy.

Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,"From a 16oz can, dated 07/25/22. Served in a willi becher pub glass.

Pours a crystalline caramel-copper with two-plus fingers of rocky suds. Retention is good, leaving robust streaks of foamy lacing. Colour-wise, it's sort of midway between what I'd expect a märzen and a festbier to look like.

Nose is bready-malty and somewhat reminiscent of a caramel apple.

Taste has more of a sharp, earthy bite to it than what I'd smelled. Tasting brown bread and apple, caramel, nuts, tea and tobacco. There may be a subtle, slightly sweet, pine needley aftertaste that’s hard to account for but only mildly discordant and really more of a curiosity than anything else.

Feel is smooth and slick, somewhat full bodied relative to the style with fine, tingly carbonation. A little more carbonation would have been welcome considering it’s heft.

Overall, a credible Oktoberfestbier. A somewhat Americanized take on the style - despite the claim of being ‘brewed with all German ingredients’ - but not outrageously so. It’s probably a little too thick if it were my intention to drink all four cans in one sitting. Not that that’s ever really my intention. It just sort of seems to happen.",3.5
Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,"From the bottom of the can: ""2 B CANNED ON 08/2/22 14:25""

Appearance: The body is a golden-brown color with hints of burnt orange. It has good clarity with a light opalescence. The head is medium-large and has an off-white eggshell appearance with a fluffy and creamy textured surface that borders on rocky. It has pretty good retention. Not much in the way of lacing aside from a few spots.

Aroma: The aroma is of malts that are slightly bready with a light maillard character and a touch dusty. There are also hints of herbal hop notes.

Taste: Up front there are nutty and bread crust flavors. There is a touch of acorn and some light moss towards the middle with hints of tea leaves. Somewhat bitter tea leaf towards the back of the mouth. A bit of a charred note in the aftertaste which is a little odd.

Mouthfeel: It has a medium body with a semi-dry finish and a medium hop bitterness. Carbonation feels good. It is easy to drink.

Overall: For the most part the beer is good. I has a bit of an odd aftertaste and the aroma is a bit muted, but otherwise the flavors and aromas are good. The beer is very drinkable and that is one of its strongest suits. As a whole the beer was enjoyable and I could drink it again. I would recommend it, especially if you are building a mix-a-six or if you are at a festival where you can try different beers.",3.5

Decent solid Marzen. Finish is not as clean and crisp as my favorite German examples of the style. Though dryer and spicier this lager's tart apple, caramel notes and bready malt balance the spice.",3.75
Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,"Reliable brewery, reliably beer. Don't be put off by the Marzen categorization. I've bought this at least 4 or 5 years on the trot now and it's really more truly a middle ground between pure marzen (in the chewy, malty vein) and festbier (in the hoppier, spicier style). That said, it's a very reliable take and a good option at a good price point for a nice session.

There's some herbal bitterness to accompany a firm malt body, which is somewhat pronounced but well balanced. The nose is all Bavarian malt and hops, smells so wonderful. Taste is even keeled, nothing pulling one way or the other. Have to compliment the exceptional fining and conditioning - sharp clarity, fluffy head receding to a sort of pool of copper, looks wonderful.

Flavor is some caramel up front followed by a bit of bready malt and some light toasted notes. The toasted grain flavor lingers after each sip.

Oaktoberfest,"1.5 x 12 oz bottle
Glassware: 0.5 L Festmug


Look:
Clear very golden copper (more gold than copper). Head was initially 2 fingers of creamy off-white foam which then dissipated slowly to about 1/4 inch of the same.

Smell:
Light and almost crackery malts that is more in line with a helles (or pilsner) than a Marzen. There is a touch or 2 of grassy hops hiding in the background. No oak is detectable.

Taste:
Same as the nose. There is also some breadiness and a very very slight fruity note along with a metallic one.

Feel:
Smooth but wet and also watery. Body is light-medium (at best)

Overall:

I was curious about this one but I am let down by it. I was expecting a Märzen, but this is much more akin to a Festbier. I was surprised by the lack of detectable oak. The bottle was from last year (2021), so perhaps that is a factor. On the plus side it is quite drinkable. As a Festbier, this would actually be quite good and I would rate it higher - my ratings reflect this beer as an amber Märzen.

For reference, some of my favorite amber Märzens to date are Ayinger, Hacker-Pschorr, and Paulaner.",3.5
Oaktoberfest,"12oz bottle purchased off the shelf as a six-pack for $10.75 plus tax. Bottled on 07/15/22, so this is almost two months old.

Look: Pours a nice light copper color with perfect clarity. There was one-finger of off-white head that gradually reduced to a thin rim around the glass.

Smell: Nice aromas that you would expect from a Marzen - toasty, bready notes with spice and floral, earthy hops. It smells very clean and crisp. Overall, the beer smells malt forward and it also smells balanced.

Taste: Really delicious. Up front, it's bready and malty as suggested by the nose. The beer is light to medium bodied with gentle carbonation. I think the finish of this beer is the most distinctive part due to the oak lagering. The very subtle tannins and spice character of the oak barrel, along with the hops, really help to temper the maltiness of this beer so that it is a balanced and drinkable product. The finish is slightly chewy with lingering notes of bread crust, caramel, toasted oak, cocoa, and spice. I think that the oak barrels and the hop character help to make this beer finish relatively dry too. Very drinkable and enjoyable, I wouldn't mind knocking back a few of these in a row.

Feel: I would say that this has a slightly lighter body than most other Marzens that I have had recently. While I think that other Marzens tend to be closer to medium bodied, this one is light to medium bodied with gentle carbonation. At 5.2% ABV, I think that is a fitting body and mouthfeel for this beer.

Overall: This is probably one of the tastier American-made Marzens that I have had in a while. It's easy to drink and presents a nice combination of malty, hoppy, and drinkability.

Oaktoberfest,"A thin, off-white head floats above the almost clear, dark golden amber beer. Minimal to no lace forms on a Pretentious Glass Company dimpled mug.

The aroma is sweet with light graininess. There is a faint suggestion of oak against light toast with honey.

This is more bitter than I had expected, however, the bitterness is far from strong. Sweetness follows. In general, the flavor is less interesting than I had expected. In particular, there are no wood flavors. The finish is mild and long.

The body is medium to full with a hard, smooth texture. Slight metallic notes accentuate light astringency. Alcohol is as expected, barely noticeable. Carbonation in light and fizzy.

While this is a decent beer, I found nothing shines. Octoberfests do tend to be less flashy than other styles. However, I had expected the oak would be more pronounced and add some excitement.",3.75

Overall: This is a delightful beer. This is my second time with this beer and didn’t see it last year but I feel like this is better than what I had two years ago and I liked that one too - apparently this year’s one is now actually oak-aged so that is probably why.

Oaktoberfest,"12 oz bottle, dated 7/20/21. Parish Pint Glass.

Has a beautiful light amber glow, skewing strawberry-blonde, with a creamy buttered head of 1 finger. Leaves lace as it recedes. Marvelous!

Aroma brings me back to the days of reviewing my first beers on here. Same time of year, too. Wet mash, toasted grain, some hop sharpness rounding it all out...some deeper descriptors I wouldn't have picked up on back then would be apricot, caramel, crisp apple, and flower bed.

Man it's been awhile since I've had a good Marzen. This one was a great re-entry. Lots and lots of toasty, crisp munich and caramunich malts open this up, creating a bed for herbal hops and dry grass. Lemon peel and slight citrusy brine wrap up the finish.

Carbonated feel with slight parch and moderate to strong resins. Alcohol is detectable at only 5.2% but it's permissible as appropriate warmth since certain areas of the world would be experiencing colder temperatures already at the end of September.

Overall, a very delightful take on the Marzen and one I'd be glad to have again. I wish we got Firestone Walker here in South Dakota, but I suppose like all other breweries their stuff would sit and rot as very few people buy beer here.

I would buy it again should I be within FW distro around Sept-Oct.

Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"500mL can purchased off the shelf as part of a 4-pack for $11.99.

Look: Pours a crystal clear golden color with a fluffy white head. Looks like a ""textbook"" beer.

Smell: Subtle fruity/estery/floral aromas balanced with grassy hop character. There is a crackery, doughy malt presence too. Notes of a pale, floral honey as well.

Taste: This is very crushable. It has a very pleasant flavor and a nice body. You would expect a beer that is this pale to be relatively light in body. However, this beer is probably closer to medium bodied because it has a rich maltiness akin to a Helles lager. It has a lovely toasted grain flavor. On the finish, which is mildly to moderately bitter, I get notes of white grape must. The beer is super crisp and clean. It's hard to believe that this beer is 6.0% ABV. It would be very easy to drink a lot of this beer.

Feel: The mouthfeel is really nice - it's perfectly carbonated and it is close to medium bodied. The beer is crisp, clean, and very refreshing.

Overall: This is my first time consuming a beer in the Festbier style. It's fitting that my first one is from Paulaner, who popularized the Festbier style. This is very different from Oktoberfest Marzen, which I am much more familiar with. I enjoyed this one and look forward to trying other Festbier examples from other breweries!",4.0

Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"This is a very nice beer. What can I say that haven’t been said about it yet? Smooth, yes we know, hoppy, sure, well, balanced, hell yeah!
There is something about its taste that you could drink again and again and again - guess that is why they made this the Oktoberfest Bier. Some lagers might have strange hops, excessive yeasty overtone or are too heavy on malts and therefore are too sweet - and these make a beer less easy to drink. But when it comes to the Oktoberfest, it is all about drinking beers by the gallon so it had better be a good one and an easy drinker! Well, THIS is that one! Now all what is missing is a plane ticket to Munich, the timing would be right though… A legendary, amazingly drinkable beer.",4.5
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Golden straw colour, slightly on the darker side with a three finger white head. Smell is big, rich, bready malt, fresh cut grass, a nice peppery note, with some alcohol presence. The taste begins with that nice doughy, bready malt, then gives way to quite noticeable ethanol, and finishes with gentle but interesting grassy and subtly spicy hops and more liquid bread. The carbonation is quite gentle for a lager, which makes it smoother and easier to drink, but the alcohol is noticeable in the smell and taste, which is a slight complaint for me. Overall a tasty, drinkable Festbier, with nice flavours and a smooth medium body. My only minor gripe is the ethanol note is not hidden as well as it is in some other beers that have just as high or higher ABV, but that's forgivable and it's not that bad anyway.

Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: 45.5 F


Look:
Bright golden yellow with a 2-finger frothy and foamy white head. The head lasts ands lasts. And lasts. As is slowly dissipates it leaves excellent lacing on the sides of my fest mug.

Smell:
Bready and biscuity malts. Touch of sweet but slightly zesty lemon. Mild floral and grassy hops.

Taste:
Things start off with some tingly and zesty hops, then lemon and lemon rind shows up followed by sweet bready malts with a touch of honey. The hops provide a mild bitterness throughout the sip which dries out as it end.

Feel:
Soft and clean. A tad chewy. Body is light-medium.

Overall:
A very easy-drinking and quaffable Oktoberfest beer that is actually (and, to me, surprisingly) refreshing. I can certainly see this beer being consumed in great quantities at festivals. I am having this in the evening after a bit of a hot day (in the 90s) with some humidity and the beer is drinking very well. I haven't had many Festbiers to date, but this seems a pretty solid representation of the style. And, if I recall, it was one of the first Festbiers that I ever came across.

I have seen some comparison of this beer to an amped us Helles. I disagree. To me this beer is more like a slightly amped up Dortmunder Export.",4.0

Taste: True to style, as expected. Malt is the main focus here. Initial sharp bite, but then sweet. Dinner rolls, unsalted peanuts, creamed corn, Twinkies. No bitterness, just a warm, almost buttery finish and a delicious aftertaste, again with those buttery notes.

Mouthfeel: Thin body, but pleasantly sticky and remaining on the tongue.

Overall: Great, mellow beer, just what you want from an Oktoberfest brew. Goes well with anything and is easily, happily consumed in large quantities.",4.0

Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a .5L stein. Color is clear gold. A white head falls quickly to a light cap. A lot of carbonation bubbles rising up through the body. Smell is malty, bready, a bit of honey. Taste starts with a balance between bready, doughy malt and herbal hops. Middle leans a bit more toward hops with a nice bitter kick that transitions to a finish with more bready, almost yeasty, flavors. Feel is medium-light body, good carbonation that cleans up your palate. Overall, this is a great beer that goes down easy during Oktoberfest ""season"". Pairs well with all the classic Oktoberfest foods too. Really enjoyed.",4.25

Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Appearance: Pours a clear, light golden color with a moderate white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of pale malts, bread malts, only hints of toast. Smooth and somewhat bready. (3.50)

Flavor: Strong flavors of upfront of toasted pale malts and honey. An earthy and floral flavor of Munich malts. A pale bready malt finish. (4.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied and low to moderate carbonation. Leaves a sweet feel on the palate. (3.75)

Compared to Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen 10/28/21: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. More bready, pale malts. Less toasty and woodsy Christmas tree pine.

Overall: A fantastic and authentic festbier. This one nails the toasted pale malts, honey and earthy Munich malt flavors. Allows the flavors to shine through since this one is in a can. Sometimes these are bottled and often light-struck and skunked. However, this is excellent. (Final Rating: 3.99)",4.25
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"This is Paulaner's second Oktoberfest offering - see Oktoberfest Marzen for the other one. This one is a bit less malty I think, which was a surprise when I saw that it was 6% ABV.

Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"500ml can into a pint glass. Canned 3/22/21, best by 3/22/22.

Looks decent in the glass. Crystal clear pale golden yellow body. The initial big white head shrinks to a ring and faint covering. A little lacing.

Strong aroma. Malty, grainy, even a little caramel.

On tasting, malty, bready, a little dry. The caramel lingers around. Somehow crisp but not clean.

Mouth medium, finish malty and drying.

Overall, not bad, just a little odd when compared to other recent festbiers. Perhaps 7 months in the can is the issue here.",3.75
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Bought the gift pack with a Maas glass and 1l can of Oktoberfest bier. Note to Paulaner, please sell this in the can at retail, I hate wasting three bottles for a Maas. This is rich, malty and sweet taking you on a nice journey. The hops have bright floral notes that balance the sweet malt without the bitterness desired by hopheads. Really drinkable at 6% and really nice for the style. Get some and make the darn cans available already.",4.0

Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"500ml can poured into a dimpled mug.
Canned 3/22/21

Pouring crystal clear and rich gold, @6 SRM, it is topped with near two fingers of white persistent foam that leaves lacing. This is a lively pour with masses of tiny, rising bubbles replenishing a head that lessens but never disappears. The moderate strength nose is also persistent featuring sweet bready malt along with spicy Noble hop aromas.

Delivering big but clean and balanced flavor front to back, it is semi-sweet with mild bitterness. Tasting bready with sweeter grains, spicy and light floral flavors. Mouthfeel is medium weight, soft and mildly creamy with lightly crisp edges coming from medium carbonation. Well rounded, easy drinking and very enjoyable. Great Festbier.",4.5

Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,Gold in color with a hazy complexion and some moderate sized sediment suspended within the body. There’s a quarter inch of dishwater white on top. Moderate soapy lacing.

Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"its crazy how bad voodoo imperial is, i mean relatively speaking for what these guys are capable of, so i didnt expect a whole lot from this one, given it plays in a similar space. i was lucky enough to have to on draft rather than from the huge can where the bottom half is almost always assuredly rough unless you just blast it down, so that might be a factor here, but this is actually impressively good, even if i kind of hate to admit it because ive held a grudge against voodoo imperial for some time now, one of the worst beers in that single serve strong ipa space, despite tearing it up some how in terms of sales, who drinks more than one or two of those ever?! anyway, this is a different breed, thankfully. its almost nuts how strong it is, because it drinks light. its got some light unfiltered sort of chill haze to it, not big and starchy and thick, nor is it amber, like a lot of these are, not over malty for balance, smart call, seems like maybe some white wheat with the pale barley, real simple, big enough in stature but dry and light in flavor, even uplifting, it accentuates rather than balances out the hops in the taste too, cool. the hop profile rules, and tastes about as good as it smells, juicy is an understatement, with ripe mango and cantaloupe to it, but shockingly not sugary, love how clean the ferment is, not metallic, fusel, or even all that warm to me. playful hints of coconut, papaya, and sweet orange, really fruity, almost seems like it has to be fruit, but lots of new school hops in here, southern hemisphere maybe, and seemingly a lot of strains, no expense spared? good for these guys, especially because this is still affordable. no bitterness, but i dont miss it this time around, and i think this has great flavor, freshness, and dangerous drinkability, summer but good for any time, a good morning beer, mimosa vibes here too, just really fruity and good. high carbonation makes it quite light to drink. i dont know why i expected to dislike this, i used to love everything these guys made, its only recently my impression has turned, largely thanks to the imperial voodoo, this is totally redeeming. really tasty and well made, a standout in an increasingly crowded style space and format. call a spade a spade, this rules.",4.0
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"It looks like a killer hazy ipa, but smells and tastes like an alcoholic V8 splash. If that sounds good at all you will probably like this one. Also the 9.5 abv makes this a good bargain beer. It almost feels wrong calling it a beer though.",4.0
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"19.2 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 6/1/22, best before 12/4/22. Pours moderately hazy golden yellow color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head. Great spotty soapy lacing and streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Amazing juiced aromas up front of candied orange slices/juice, vanilla, lemon, passion fruit, pineapple, mango, melon, white grape, apricot. The taste follows much of the same suit with mandarin orange slices, vanilla, lemon, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, grape, coconut, berries, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, wheat, white bread dough, herbal, floral, grass, yeast earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus rind, herbal, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; balanced creamy/bready malts and sticky/resinous hops in the mouthfeel. Long drying resin finish, with a bit of spicy alcohol that gets a bit boozy after the finish, warming 9.5% is well showcased. A pretty wide variety of hops with Mosaic, Chinook, Pahto, Galaxy, Strata, Lotus, and Sabro. I have never had Pahto or Lotus. The creamsicle nose is pretty wild; everything comes together so well in the nose, as I was almost certain fruit was harmed in the making of this beer. The taste has more dank/earthiness on the hops, with the alcohol being a bit harsh, but certainly not too out of the ordinary for the gravity. It was very smooth for the ABV. I'd totally get more of these stovepipes or a 6 pack.",4.5
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,Tastes like a 40,2.5
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"Looks fine, on the dark size for haze. Aroma is overripe citrus. More overripe fruit in the taste, with the high alcohol also pervasive. Medicinal and difficult to drink.",2.75
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"straight boozy orange juice with a dash of grapefruit juice; very little hop bitterness to it, and the high abv is totally hidden, but there is a slightly medicinal tinge to it which may slow you down a little.
makes for an interesting entry point for those who typically dislike IPAs and want the benefits of a high abv brew.
as an IPA lover, I kinda hate it, and feel like it sets the style back a tad, imagining a future which sees more ""IPAs"" like this saturating the market. on the other hand, this is nothing short of a great party beer, making for a cheap ticket to buzz town.

not really the hill I'll choose to die on, but would be pretty sad to see the popularity of this brew take the shelves by storm.",3.75
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,This ain’t your hipster’s IPA! It tastes great without the slightest hint of pine cone hoppyness. It’s has a great grapefruit citrus flavor. The take is more astringent and light. This is the IPA that you want to get drunk with. There’s a depth and a full bodied flavor; not over powering the other. It goes down easy and you need to watch out for that! Classy from New Belgian!,4.75

The second time i tried it I did a side by side with another imperial pale ale - 90 Minute by Dogfish Head. There are no comparisons that can be made between them. I paid the same price for the 6'er of Juice Force as I did the 4 pack of 90 Minute, but will say the quality and value of 90 Minute far exceeds that of the Juice Force.",2.75

Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"The Voodoo Ranger Juice Force is not just a silly beer, with an eye popping ABV and a name that is reminiscent of a poor drum and bass MC freestyling their way down a tricky couplet. No, it's a way of life.

That way of life is regret of missed birthdays, fearful of calls from the bank manager and lack of recollection of lifes wonder moments. Yes, it certainly packs a punch, akin to Mike Tyson, and with similar disregard to concepts such as consent, gut health and clarity of value judgements. As Britney Spears once sang, It came in like a wrecking ball. A shame said wrecking ball, also resulted in colleteral damage to my marriage. I can only see the kids every other weekend, but I am a Voodoo Ranger of the Juice Force 7 days a week, and for that, I am grateful to New Belgium Brewing Company.

Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"A dark, but bright and somewhat translucent amber brew, drawn from a tap and delivered in a clear pint glass has arrived. The head is white, spotty and minimal. The malt dominate aroma is complex and not overly sweet. Is it vaguely nutty? Well, there seems to be a nut-like quality here to taste, likely a combination of the hops and malts. This drinks richly and incredibly smoothly malty, but not close to being overly sweet. The lack of a head and subsequent lack of lacing doesn’t indicate anything, as this is just about perfectly carbonated. The finish is wet, but clean. This will be one of the best Marzens you'll ever have.",4.5

Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"Notes from 8/29/2022.
Poured from a 11oz bottle into a pint glass.
The body is amber with 2 fingers of tan head. Retention is good leaving a fluffy cap.
The intensity of aroma is low. There are notes of malt and yeast. This has one of the lowest aroma levels I've experienced.
The intensity of taste is somewhat above medium. Very malty. Wow. A lot of delicious complex malt flavor. Although subtle, the flavor has a long transition from being malt forward and then a light hop bitterness that comes in and continues to develop. I like the slight alcohol flavor at the end. World class.
The feel is almost thick. It's fairly creamy with light carbonation that prickles the tongue. Astringency is medium and balances the malt forward flavor.
Overall, the appearance, flavor and feel more than make up for the very low aroma. As far as Oktoberfest beers go, this is hands down the best I've had.",4.5
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"500 ml bottle poured into a Czech brewery pilsner glass, at fridge temp. Great foamy head that lingers just a bit.
Bought the say it went on sale, it’s very fresh!
So good, so balanced and rounded - sweet yet bitter, great flavors - this is just a beautiful European Fest beer.",4.25
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"16.9oz can purchased off the shelf as a single for $3.49. Lot code L2039. Not sure what that means but this must be fresh as it must have been bottled recently and then imported to the US.

Look: Beautiful orange/copper color, crystal clear. Small tan colored head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. Tiny bubbles rising up the glass.

Smell: Malt forward with notes of toffee, caramel, and bread crust. Throw in some spice, floral aromas, along with earthy and soil-like notes on the finish. Interesting mix of aromas. After drinking several ounces, I make a comparison of the aromas to cream soda. Subtle note of baked apples with cinnamon.

Taste: This is really delicious. It's super drinkable and really well-balanced. Some of those lager funk notes come out on the palate, and they are welcome. Up front, this is definitely malty but it's restrained; it's malty without being sweet, which I appreciate. The carbonation is slightly spritzy, and the finish is smooth and pleasant - relatively dry considering how malt-forward the beer is and with a very gentle bitterness. The lingering perception of the beer is earthiness and a bit of spice (allspice?).

Feel: Slightly chewy mouthfeel, medium plus body. Carbonation is just right. It's not heavy or cloyingly sweet, just very balanced and drinkable.

Overall: My first Ayinger beer review. This has got to be one of the better Marzens out there. Considering that this is a mass-produced, widely distributed beer it is super impressive. They must have got their brewing process down to a science. If you could take a sourdough or Bavarian hard pretzel and make a beer inspired by those flavors, that's kind of what I imagine this beer to be.",4.25

Bottle Code: L2055 => 24 Feb, 2022
Glassware: 0.5 L Festmug (Masskrug?)
ABV: 5.8%

Look:
Bright medium copper with hints of gold. The gold is more prominent when held to a light. Initial foamy 3-finger cream-colored head dissipates to a single finger's width with excellent lacing.

Smell:
Wow. Bread. Bread. Bread. And more bread. All very lightly toasted. Light notes of freshly cut grass flirt in the background.

Taste:
Follows the nose but with the toast more prominent. Wonderfully bready. There is a very light note toasted caramel or toffee in here as well. Also a faint earthy note. Everything is expertly balanced. The finish is a long, slowly fading toasted bread and grain note with a tinge of grass and a slowly increasing dryness (and bitterness).

Feel:
Super smooth and clean. The body is medium with maybe a lean towards medium-light.

Overall:
An outstanding amber Märzen-style Oktoberfest. It has all of the qualities of a Märzen with the drinkability of a Festbier. This has been my favorite (or in my top 2 or 3) Märzens for about a decade. I purchase at least a box (20 x 500 ml bottles) every year.

Look:
Dark and burnished copper that is hazy and somewhat opaque. I can see my fingers on the other side of the glass (and not very clearly) but that's about it. Makes me think of a Kellerbier. Initial 3-finger head dissipates to a thin covering with good lacing.

Smell:
Malts, malts, malts. Freshly baked whole wheat bread. Biscuits. And also bread dough. There are also notes of a darker honey such as basswood honey or wildflower honey. Yum.

Taste:
Follows the nose but with some toasted caramel notes added in. There is a malty earthiness present as well. Everything is balanced very well. The finish is a long slowly fading toasted grain note along with a slowly increasing dryness.

Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"Gem-clear amber (SRM 9-10) with an orange tint. One inch of almond cream lasts a few minutes, leaving patchy lace. Tiny, lazy bubbles of carbonation are magnified in the dimples of a Spaten mug.

The malt is sweet with no roasted or toasted notes. Light honey adds character to the scent of wheat bread dough. The aroma is mild, yet has distinct notes, similar to macadamia and almonds.

The balance is excellent, with sweetness up front and bitterness at the end. Unlike the aroma, toasted malt is strong. Wheat bread and light honey come out late. The finish is long and mild, carrying the toasted malt, and none of the other flavors, as it lingers.

The texture is velvety smooth, with a medium body. Residual sugar builds on the lips, while light alcohol and soft, tingling carbonation enliven the tongue.

This is a pleasant and easy-going Autumnal beer. I enjoyed it on a cool, sunny afternoon in the early Autumn. My only wish is that I had a salted, toasted pretzel with mustard to go with it.",4.0
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"Look: Really deep amber, large foamy head that persists, looks like an ideal beer! Kinda like pee from someone really dehydrated!
Smell: Very yeasty (like i could get a yeast infection from just being around it!), hints of spices? like cinnamon and clove, kinda like pumpkin pie?? a little bit like persimmon...
Taste: Pretty bitter upfront, but mellows out into some burnt caramel notes, a bit bready, has some fruity notes like apple cider. also some fig jam flavors and some molasses
Feel: Kinda leaves your mouth a little dry, very little carbonation, like tiny bubbles that make it almost creamy in my mouth

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"I poured a 12 oz. can into a pint glass. nice amber orange color, a one-inch head that receded quickly, typical of the style. The nose is nice, pumpkin, caramel, and vanilla waft above the fainter smell of cinnamon and allspice. This taste is initially as expected... some evidence of pumpkin mash, vanilla and caramel, cinnamon allspice, cloves, ginger.. but then the taste grows hotter. It is peppery, and seems perhaps heavy on the ginger, and after several sips, you realize it's time to call the fire department, and start looking for water. I'm not sure why they have gone so spicy on the taste, but for me it is truly unwelcome. As for the mouthfeel, I am never comfortable when a campfire has been lit in the middle of my tongue. Overall, if you have a taste and passion for hot spicy dishes, this may be right up your alley. For me... it's not happening here.

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Pours a clear pumpkin orange with a tinge of amber and mild effervescence.

Flavor – 3 – A bit sweet with instant pepper mouth burn, no flavors of malt, yeast, hops, nor pumpkin. Any cinnamon present is lost in the assortment of chilis. No ethanol (6.4% ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma; however, there is no gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 3 – Medium, watery, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3. Looks good but aroma and taste-wise, it’s just another chili beer.",3.0

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"I'm not going to bother writing up a full breakdown of this beer as there isn't much to say besides why? It's pretty much a run of the mill pumpkin without much complexity. But yet your throat burns like you are dealing with a cold. I have to wonder if NB decided to toss in the peppers to distract you from the fact on how mediocre this is. I just don't get it as the chili's add absolutely nothing to the flavor profile. I mean if you want to make this ""something"" make it hot enough to make you sweat. That way you can give it to your buddy's in a glass without warning.

Anyhow I love NB's lineup, in fact they make some of my favorite beers (Trippel). But this is just depressing.",3.0
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium golden to orange color that is madly bubbling and a strong and creamy white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of fall spices upfront including cinnamon and cloves. Then it follows with some sweet apple pie and pumpkin pie crust malty aromas. (3.75)

Flavor: Moderate flavors upfront of fall spices including cinnamon and cloves. The malts are apple pie and pumpkin pie crust. Then in the middle the spicy pepper comes through. It doesn't stop. The spicy pepper carries through the end leaving a spicy bite through the finish. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. The spiciness comes through the middle and wipes through the end scorching any flavors in the beer and leaving them with a spicy pepper note. (3.50)

Overall: Not a huge drinker of pumpkin/flavored beers and cautiously headed toward this one given the words ""atomic"", ""spicy"", and ""pumpkin"". I can say the beer drinks quite well. The spices and malt flavors are well done with nice fall flavors of apple and pumpkin pie. The spiciness is definitely interesting and not subtle by any means. Cleans through the end and rips the palate. I can say it's better than many flavored/pumpkin beers I've had but sort of like a jalapeno, I don't think I would/could have more than one.

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Drinking this at The Parting Glass Pub in downtown Andrews NC.
Poured from a tap into a pint glass.
Looks orangish with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to a very thin ring.
Smells lightly cinnamon, bready, spicy, pumpkin.
Taste follows the nose, WOW! Pepper, pepper, pepper on the back of palate.
That being said, there's a lot going on here, very complex. Pepper is all over the place some sips pepper, some sips more cinnamon. However the pepper builds on your palate and if you don't like pepper? You won't like this beer.
There is a bit of vanilla as well.
Mouth feel, falls short here, this is a beer that would've benefitted from a stronger malt base.
Overall this is a Pumpkin beer unlike any I've ever had, unusual, complex, spicy. A little more malt would've made this the greatest pumpkin beer ever.

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"I was really excited about this one, I love NB and always seek out a few pumpkin spice beers every year when the seasons are changing. Also- I’ve been brewing spicy beers lately and really love them.

This is one of the worst beers I’ve had in a long time. The feel is thin and unsatisfying, and combined with an overwhelming sweetness it feels like drinking a soda. Pumpkin spice flavor completely overwhelms, so the flavor becomes completely one-dimensional and really leaves almost nothing recognizably beer-y in terms of flavor. As for the spicy notes, they’re almost non-existent except as an annoying tingle in the back of your throat. I actually forgot it was spiced until I read the can again. Color is fine, nice amber but the head is so weak as a result of thin sugary consistency.

Overall, I’ll never buy this or probably any other pumpkin spice beer ever again. I could only stomach one of the 6 and gave the rest to a homeless man.",2.0

Oktoberfest Märzen,"Notes from 8/30/2022.
Poured from a bottle into a Pint glass.
The beer is clear copper with less than a finger of off-white head. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is low. There is a crackery malt smell, an earthy smell and a slight yeast aroma.
The intensity of taste is medium-high. The flavor follows the aroma with more bitterness and dryness than the aroma suggests. The long bitter hop note is moderate, spicy and creates a layer of flavor over the crackery malt, earthy flavor and slight yeast.
The feel is slightly above medium in thickness. Carbonation and astringency are low. It's quite dry. The carbonation prickles the tongue.
Overall, it's an outstanding beer. The quality of taste is noticeably better than the Marzen beer brewed in the US that I've had.",3.75
Oktoberfest Märzen,"1.5 x 333 ml bottle
Bottle Date 06 2022
Glassware: 0.5 L Festmug


Look:
Nice deep but clear copper. Initial 2-finger cream-colored foamy head dissipates very slowly leaving quite good lacing

Smell:
Quite malty without being sweet. Lighty toasted grains and bread. A lot of bread, mostly brown variety. There are notes of grass and fresh cut hay drifting around in the background

Taste:
Very much similar to the nose but with the grass and hay notes more prominent. This really does taste like liquid bread. There is some earthiness as well. Things finish dry and toasty with a slight spiciness.

Feel:
Smooth and a tad crisp Body is on the lighter side of medium.

Overall:
A very nice Märzen-style Oktoberfest. This is one of the standard-bearers of the style and rightfully so. Things do change slightly year-to-year for this brew (not by much though). Some years I prefer this brew, other years I prefer Hacker-Pschorr's. The 2 are very similar and are owned, if not brewed, by the same company. Between the 2, Paulaner always seemed to tend to being more 'grassy' or even spicy.

Oktoberfest Märzen,"A frothy one inch of off-white head falls to hold at about one half inch. Spotty lace is left on a Pretentious Glass Company dimpled mug. The Marzen is dark amber, similar to corten steel and is almost clear. Tiny bubbles of carbonation lazily form in random patterns.

Sweet malt has an earthiness of orchard fruit in the background. There is also a light peppery hop aroma, however, it really is all about the malt. Fresh wheat bread comes on strong and grows with warmth.

While well balanced, it tilts slightly toward bitterness. The wheat bread is almost as strong in the flavor as it was in the aroma. Cashews and walnuts come in waves. The finish is simple, mild, and lingering.

A medium body of scratchy woolen texture. Carbonation is modest and fizzy, while the alcohol is as expected. There are slight notes of metallic qualities.

Oktoberfest Märzen,"Tonight is a new to me beer

Paulaner – Oktoberfest Marzen

5.8% ABV

The beer is listed as a “Oktoberfest Marzen” on the bottle, and “Lager – Marzen” on BA.

The beer was removed from a 45ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 weeks. Beer poured into a HB stein.

First Impression: Looks the part. Pretty. Clear. 4.5

Appearance: This is what I would call a golden amber color. Somewhere between gold and amber. 4.35

Smell: Bier, first and foremost, as I always say. Followed by a small amount of rye spice, bread, malt, There seems to be an almost underlying lemon zest note, almost dancing on the hairs in your nostrils, if you know what I mean. 4.0

Taste: Not as flavorful as some others. A bit more one-note. A bit of bread, a bit of malt. None of the rye or lemon mentioned above. I’m struggling to identify much, as it tastes a bit watered down. 3.75

Mouthfeel: A tad thin. I almost think of most oktoberfests as being almost syrupy in their consistency, but not that thick. That may be odd. I’m struggling to describe exactly what I mean. There’s something about them that is a bit thicker on the mouth than I think they appear. 4.0

Overall: I enjoyed this. I’d have more if I had them, but at the same time I don’t think I’ll specifically seek out more of these compared to others. Very middle of the road for me. 4.00

Aroma is stunning - rich notes of cocoa, chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow, roasted malts, oak and bourbon. Decadence at its finest.

The aroma is excellent, massive barrel character, huge spirit heat, charred oak, roasted grain, bittersweet dark chocolate, toasted coconut, stone fruits, heavy vanilla marshmallow and a sea salt kick. The flavors are good, super rich chocolate, dark, bittersweet, big roast, charred oak, coconut, toffee, brown sugar, stone fruits, vanilla marshmallow and light sea salt.

Aroma is complex, ginger, lemon, and cedar.

Taste is similar, ginger and lemon dominate, backing some floral green peppercorn notes. Zero black pepper phenolics. Very light and airy, nice carb. Easygoing and delicious.

People surely realize there is a range of peppercorn plants besides ground black pepper they’re already familiar with, right? Highly doubt anyone has had Congolese pepper before today, and never in a beer.

Medium-bodied, the dryness and fluffy carbonation increase palate presence and grip. The profile very similar to the nose with even greater emphasis on a mineral, quinine nature. Speaking for myself, finding it underfruited and I am not one for bombastic IPA's. The substantial maltiness keeps the bitterness in check.

Little Whaleboat,"16.9oz bottle purchased from the fridge for $7.49. Bottled on 6/28/22, so this is exactly five weeks old.

Look: Pours a nice light golden color with a very faint haze. There was a thick, off-white head with compact to medium bubbles that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. Nice lacing.

Smell: The aromas are intoxicating. Lots of tropical fruits including passion fruit, mango, papaya, orange, and guava. There is an interesting vanilla sweetness on the back end that I tend to get with Maine Beer Company beers. I also get this slightly acidic/juicy citrus note along with an even more subtle green bell pepper note. Allusions of dank pine resin and bitterness on the back end also.

Taste: This is sooooo drinkable! It is super juicy and flavorful, mirroring the flavors on the nose with tons of citrus and orange peel. The malt base is super light with a very subtle crackeryness and some very subtle caramel malt notes; this beer is a showcase for hops. The finish is moderately bitter with lots of grapefruit pith, and lingers long with intense mouth-drying ability.

Feel: Low side of medium body with appropriate carbonation.

Overall: Solid. A very tasty, West Coast Style IPA from Maine. Cool that this beer uses Talus hops. I think that I have only had one other beer that uses Talus hops and that was River Horse Sunset Citrus, which I really enjoyed.

Little Whaleboat,"From bottle (presume it looks like a Maine Beer, but went with my average):

Smell and taste both have a citrus pith lean. The nose leans a little more on the zest where the taste brings in more pith. There’s a candied zest nature in the nose and opening of the taste, but bitterness in the latter is firm and welcome, mostly pith with a hint of grass - both types. Tangerine, peach, orange and a little grapefruit. A great mix of the fruit notes backed by classic hop bitterness.",4.25

Little Whaleboat,"From the label: ""009 29JUN22 09:15:55""

Appearance: The body is hazy but there are no particulates or visible suspended solids. It has a light gold color that has a bit of a lemon appearance. It has a short fluffy white head with a creamy texture. It has good head retention and it has wisps of lacing on the glass.

Aroma: Immediately the nose is struck by lemon zest with a strong garlic aroma. There is a hint of lime and some pine. The aroma is strong and poignant.

Taste: Up front there is peach and lemon with a touch of lime. A freshly crushed grain flavor is also present. Towards the middle of the palate the same flavors are accentuated even more. It has hints of mint and lime zest towards the back of the palate with touches of cilantro. The beer tastes very fresh. The aftertaste is slightly floral which is interesting because there were no floral notes while drinking the beer and there were no floral aromatics. It has a bit of a floral retronasal character after drinking each sip which is very reminiscent of being in a flower section of a garden store. At times it became slightly grassy on the finish. After a while a bit of white pepper flavor also emerged.

Mouthfeel: It is light bodied trending towards medium, with good carbonation. It has a medium pithy bitterness from the hops. It feels bright on the palate.

Overall: The beer is an excellent example of the style. It brings bright aromas and flavors with excellent precision. The beer would pair very well with any dish that might need a little bit of acidity or citrus. This would be great with snapper, salmon, or even lamb. I would definitely buy it again and I highly recommend it.",4.5

Taste: A good, complex flavor profile. Starts off with a balanced blend of citrus rind, pine resin and grapefruit, and then evolves into a notable lingering tangy bitterness in the middle with some tropical fruits. All the while, subtle malts in the background compliment the whole thing, keeping it in composition. The bitterness rides all the way through the somewhat boozy finish.

Pliny The Elder,"Tasted on tap at Native Son Ale house in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.

L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.

S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style.

T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style.

F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.

O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that.",4.5
Pliny The Elder,"Wow, have seen some sub 4 reviews of Pliny....wawhat??!! This is by far one of the best beers out there. Regardless of your hoppy beer type preference being pale ale, IPA, or stout, this DIPA will knock your socks off both with its wonderful taste as well as its effect. Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar.

The crisp, punchy, and herbaceous ale fills the glass with a heady aroma. It is an honest beer and sometimes that is all you need.",4.5
Pliny The Elder,"Had on tap. Looks slightly hazed gold color with 2 finger white head of soft foam. Head fell to a cap after a few minutes. Left some nice lacing in the glass. Smell was all hops. A lot of tropical and citrus fruit is in the aroma. Taste enters sweet with a healthy dose of grapefruit, orange, mango. Middle has a bit of pithy bitterness and more tropical flavors but its balanced by a nice malt backbone. Finish is balanced with a slight hint of alcohol. Feel is medium bodied, lower carbonation but enough to provide a solid base for the flavor. Overall, well worth the wait for this classic expression. The flavors were bold, bright, and expressive. The beer was well balanced even with the bold hop presence. I enjoyed this a lot.",4.75
Pliny The Elder,"Long time coming. I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.

Cheers. TBB.",3.0
Pliny The Elder,"Appearance: Very slightly hazy gold, nice carbonation, good head.

Smell: Strong grapefruit, slight rind.

Taste: Moderately sweet to start, then a balancing shot of grapefruit bitterness. Stays balanced between sweet and bitter before the bitterness wins out in the finish.

Overall: Bottled 7/18, tasted 8/13. Bought in Colorado and brought back, a long-time want finally obtained after 26 hours of driving round trip (I did do other stuff on this trip, not just beer shopping). Just a classic flavor, nice balance but plenty of hoppy bitterness. Definitely worth the trip.",4.5
Pliny The Elder,"Appearance: Clarity is clear, silky head, laces the glass throughout the session and has a long lasting head retention. Perfect pale/bronze color.

Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background.

Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.

Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.

This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor.",4.5

A- Golden-orange body capped with a 1/2 finger off-white head. Awesome thick lace left on the glass. Retains at a thin foam.

S- Grapefruit and Topical scents with a sugary doughy backbone. Robust and fresh. Leafy hops, tobacco, resin and herbs as it opens up.

T- Great balance of grapefruit hops up font. Doughy and sweet cracker malts in the middle like honey whole wheat. Grapefruit and herbal spicy black pepper hop finish. A little aspirin.

Pliny The Elder,"Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.

Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.

Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.

Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.

Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed.",4.25
Pliny The Elder,"Comes in a crystal clear golden color, with a creamy, marshmallowy bright white head. Incredible retention with sheets of lacing.
The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel.
Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky.
Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.

For some reason only pioneer West Coast IPA's get this treatment for their style, never the pioneers of hazy IPA's of the Northeast. This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!

I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.

There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River.

Boy, those are some nice flavors. The bitterness level being high is certainly old school and a little more than I want, but it's not ripping my tongue off either. Hops are so fresh on this and almost clean. Flavors are a little more herbal and grassy than the aroma but still some nice fruit qualities as well.
Body is only a little bigger than moderate but there is nice smoothness and richness that makes the feels soft and full. Not really sticky though.

Look: Amber, clear, white head that disappears quickly
Smell: Chemical nutmeg
Tase: Soda-pop sweet with chemical nutmeg.

Boston Beer Co. has in recent years made the lion's share of its profits from non beers: alcoholic seltzers, alcoholic teas, alcoholic apple juice. This is an alcoholic soda-pop. There's no beer here: no malt backbone, no hops, nothing. Just a strong chemical flavor that is cloyingly nutmeg-ish. I don't even taste the supposed connection with pumpkins.

This was included in a variety pack of their other beers; BBC needs to just develop a line of alcoholic soft drinks (nice contradiction there) and include this with those. In fact there was such a thing: this ""beer,"" I gather, was originally developed by Traveler Beer co., which specialized in ""shandies"" (one shudders to imagine how these other ""beers"" tasted). This outfit was owned by BBC. It went under, but this concoction for some reason was saved and revived by BBC. btw and fwiw: a really nice shandy, or Radler, is Von Trapp's grapefruit ""trail beer.""

Samuel Adams Jack-O,"12oz bottle

Pours a sturdy finger of dense white head into my Boston Lager glass. Retention is wonderful, hardly losing any head after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks decent. Body is a dark copper, low visibility, with a load of nucleating bubbles coming up. Looks very nice so far.

Aroma is pretty damn assertive, and it’s a bit much. Loads of nutmeg assault the nose and it’s pretty hard to pick up anything else. Undertones of pumpkin and cinnamon. Pretty sure it’s safe to say this doesn’t smell like beer, maybe I’ve outgrown this style. It’s…alright all things considered.

Flavor is less intense, but arguably less palatable. It’s actually somewhat watery, so imagine nutmeg flavored water - yeah not that great, definitely gross at times. Like…I feel like you either make a totally bastardized pumpkin spice latte beer, or you make a real pumpkin beer that is earthy, etc. etc., but this is somehow neither. I mean, I’ve had worse, but not many in the pumpkin category, and that’s saying quite a bit.

Carbonation is on the higher side at first, fades with a little time. As mentioned, super watery, and that is true for the body as well. Bitterness is not perceptible with all the spice going on. It’s surprisingly not stupid sweet, only a touch of sweetness, which is one small redeeming factor I suppose. Overall not bad, but the watery thin mouth is pretty hard to ignore.

Appearance turned out less than expected with absolutely zero lacing.

The aroma is cinnamon. That's pretty much it - cinnamon. Touch of other spices, but the cinnamon dominates. I'm reminded of a guest at our home years ago from England who described American apple pie as ""cinnamon pie.""

Ah, the taste is much more nuanced. Cinnamon, of course, but also a malty presence and a smoothness that may be from the squash/pumpkin as well as nutmeg and cloves. Actually, this is a very tasty pumpkin beer, if that is your thing. (As I stated, it's not my preference, but this is quite good for what it is intended to be.) The finish is sweet and spicy, with a creamy feel left behind.

The mouth feel is thick-ish, smooth, and creamy, which is worthy of a ""well done"" considering the low ABV.

Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Appearance: Medium amber-orange, with a large and dense, finely-beaded head. A thick and unbroken sheet of finely-beaded lacing adorns the glass wall. Fat bubbles drift lazily to the surface.

Aroma: Classic pumpkin pie aroma is very prominent, with nutmeg and cinnamon being particularly notable. Brown sugar is a strong presence, as well. With the restrained ABV of 4.2%, there is no alcohol presence in the aroma. The aroma is overall similar to cold pumpkin pie.

Taste: The taste opens with a good measure of brown sugar and prominent pumpkin pie spices, particularly cinnamon and nutmeg. As the taste carries on, the brown sugar offers a pleasant undercurrent. Midway through the taste, there is a bit of clove. Late in the taste, there is a bit of cola flavor. The finish is rather dry.

Mouth feel: Soft and full, quite pleasant with only light carbonation.

Drinkability/notes: A quite nice example of a pumpkin beer, and at an ABV of just 4.2%, it seems very well suited to moderation. If you like a lot of pumpkin spice flavor and sweetness in a beer with a moderate ABV, this is a great choice.

KBS - Hazelnut,"the hazelnut smells and tastes almost too bold to be natural, like if this is real hazelnuts, its a whole lot of them, and infused somehow other than just resting in an ambient temperature barrel, at least it seems that way to me, but that said, its also not out of balance, and the nut seems to ground and balance some of the natural sweetness, it also makes both the chocolate and coffee pop, especially the coffee, and even though this is a small doses thing because of how strong and strongly flavored it is, its also delicious. desserty without being diabetic. the nose on this black shiny beast is nut forward, light smoke and dark roast from the coffee, plenty of bitterness there, along with dark chocolate character playing in the same space and quite a lot of oak. the bourbon is there with a little sweetness and alcohol warmth, both of which are exacerbated as it sits and comes up to temperature, the whiskey profile really flatters both the hazelnut and the coffee, big irish coffee vibes here. vanilla notes in the flavor, lots of nuance to the nut, more of a milk chocolate vibe after a few sips, but in the end its the coffee that pushes through all the dark malts and other stuff to be the dominant flavor, i taste bitter not quite perfectly fresh dark roasty drip coffee on my palate longer than any other element. its smooth the whole way, never too alcoholic, and really quite decadent. i think the hazelnut might be slightly overdone here, but it definitely brings new proportions to this iconic base beer. i always get nervous when breweries play with their legendary recipes like this one, but so far these variants have been fun and well executed. i dont need this much added flavor, but its good. cool to find this on tap too!",4.25
KBS - Hazelnut,"Bottled on 1/26/2022. Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into my snifter glass, this beer pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a dark tan head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles to an extremely thick ring lining the inside of the glass at the beer's surface along with a thick layer of surface foam and some pretty good lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and notes of hazelnut. Also an earthy and herbal hop note. The flavors are pretty much the same, with roasted malts, somewhat bitter espresso and somewhat sweet chocolate notes, toasted hazelnut, and an earthy and herbal hop note that rounds it all out. The hop flavor seems fairly dank, which I was not expecting, and it is a nice touch. The hazelnut note is also quite enjoyable and well integrated into this beer. The roast level on the malts is just a bit too intense for what I prefer, to the point where it comes across on my palate as being slightly too acrid. Actually, this note seems to get more intense as the beer warms up. Not a good thing, as it really overpowers the rest of the flavors in an unpleasant way.

KBS - Hazelnut,"Bought in Munster IN, poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a pure dark brown colour with a bit of cola like carbonation bubbles at the bottom when held to light. Head is dark tan, frothy, and built up to 2 fingers with a hard pour, settling down to a half finger for a while.

Smell is decadent. Nutty bittersweet chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate ice cream, Nutella on toast. Slight roasted flavor covered up again by nutty chocolate.

Taste: starts off with a bit of milk chocolate, accompanied by toastiness and a light nutty balancing note. Middle has a lot more of the hazelnut, roasted. Finishes with a hint of alcohol burn and a lingering burned sugar sweetness.

Overall, a fantastic dessert beer. Not as balanced as some others in the collection, but this variant would make a welcome addition to the regular line up. Drinkable and not cloying, but still obviously dessert. Nice.",4.5
KBS - Hazelnut,"L - Black with a dark tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing
S - Tons of dark chocolate, hazelnut, roasted coffee and dark malts, as well as some caramel - this is a fantastic smelling beer
T - Follows the nose: dark chocolate and hazelnut intermixed with roasted coffee (adding some bitterness to balance the sweet) and dark malts along with slight hints of bourbon and caramel

L - Pours a viscous, deep brown hue; almost black. Serious legs on this one. One-finger sticky dark tan head.
S - Strong on the hazelnut, for sure! Notes of Cadbury milk chocolate, and brown sugar.
T - Matches nose on the front. Followed by notes of lightly-roasted coffee, burnt toffee, and a slight almond nuttiness. Strong, but covered somewhat by a sticky hazelnut syrup note. On the sweeter side, but definitely balanced out by a nice roasted tone throughout.
F - Full-bodied, with little carbonation (if any). Something to be sipped. Strong. Sticky.
O - Finally got my hands on a bottle of this! It's about as much as I had expected. Super heavy on the hazelnut and chocolate notes. Definitely a dessert beer. Highly recommend.",4.25

Munsterfest,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium but bright orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 10-12. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread malts, toasted bread malts, some light, smooth caramel underneath. (4.00)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of smooth bread malt, caramel malt. A relatively dry finish.

Munsterfest,"There is a date that barely appears on the shoulder of the bottle. It seems like it is lightly etched in the glass. It is hard to read when there is beer in the bottle, but after it is poured out it is easier to see: ""BOTTLED 07-28-22 4663""

Appearance: The body is a medium-to-dark shade of golden brown. It has very good clarity. The head is short with a slightly off-white color. The head slowly recedes leaving no lacing and only a thin film of bubbles with a small ring around the glass. The color of the beer is very nice.

Aroma: There isn't much aroma but there is a very faint scent of wet leaves.

Taste: Up front there is a mixture of coffee, bread crust, and toffee. Towards the middle these flavors intensify and the bread crust flavor expands the greatest on the palate. Towards the back of the palate there is a very light spicy and herbal character which gives the beer just a bit of bite at the end. The aftertaste is very pleasant with a light tea quality and it lends itself very good drinkability.

Mouthfeel: The body is just at the threshold between light and medium, where it has a presence on the palate but moves on and off the tongue very quickly without much traction. The beer is very drinkability and it has a mild earthy bitterness. It is a very pleasant beer to drink.

Overall: The beer doesn't have much aroma, but that is quickly forgotten when the flavor kicks in. The beer delivers a wonderful complement of flavors and the beer is still light enough that it remains very drinkable. It is an easy beer to have one and just move on to another one. Although the highlight of the beer would be the fantastic drinkability, another element that is very enjoyable is the bread crust flavor which has just a very light touch of sweetness that is balanced by an earthy quality. I would recommend it because although the beer doesn't have much aroma it still tastes great. I would buy it again.",4.0

Munsterfest,"Brief Review:

O: Been about 7 years since I’ve had this one, back again with the new Michigan distro. I forgot how much on the sweet and malty side this beer is, was expecting more of a hoppy crispness. But I do like this, pretty good balance and very drinkable as a good Oktoberfest should be.

Recommendation: Maybe not a classic rendering by most standards, but this is a nice-drinking Oktoberfest for the season.",4.25
Munsterfest,"Picked up a 12 oz bottle at Half Time Distributors in Poughkeepsie NY. Poured into a pint glass, this beer shows a beautiful copper color, almost crystal clear. The head is slightly off-white, medium size with average to slightly better than average retention. lacing is minimal. Aroma is fairly faint, malty and a little spicy/toffee. Taste is better, I have had more impressive Marzens, but this one is pretty good. Malty, slightly floral with some toffee and spices with a bit of underlying bitterness. Mouthfeel is fairly light but not watery. Three Floyds often nails a style better, but this one is pretty good!!!",3.75
Munsterfest,"Pours a nice amber color. Semi clear. The head is 1 finger, it is decent lasting, but has minimal lacing on the glass.
The nose is pretty light, actually. I get a faint malt/caramel aroma, but nothing too strong.
Taste - This beer has a good deal of caramel in it, and it kicks in on the back. Up front is a buttery, bread, biscuit flavor.
The body is somewhat creamy feeling. A bit bubbly. Smooth.
Not bad. Glad I bought it to try.",3.75
Munsterfest,"Pours clear, light copper in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is fresh brown bread and dry wheat bread. Medium body and carbonation, slightly sweet. Solid Marzen but it is missing something. Decent but I prefer the German classics.",3.25
Munsterfest,"Beautifully clear deep amber just shy of acorn brown with a tall khaki foam head slowly collapsing in fits and starts to a lumpy, sparse blanket.

Exceptionally malty, toasty, and fairly bitter, there's even unexpected hints of phenolic spice. This is certainly a unique Oktoberfest, somewhat like pumpernickel verging into gingerbread, but not quite.

No, it's not a holiday beer. It's not a pumpkin spice beer. But iT's NoT nOrMaL.

It's bolder than your average marzen, in several directions.",4.25
Munsterfest,Disclaimer. Not my favorite style. But its a lager! Octs always seem to sweet. And they are high abv often. This has some of a aforementioned. But bbn leens full lager and is refreshing ice cold. Low carbonation which is ideal for this style. Paring with indian food and it should work.,3.75
Munsterfest,"Before I start, let me say this beer makes me happy. First of all, all these American o-fests have done what Americanized versions always do, and that is take the basic profiles of a style and turn all the flavors up wayyyy too high and nothing is as drinkable or balanced anymore. On that note...

Munsterfest is everything I want in an ofest. A poundable lager with malty and warm flavors, a whispy head, and beautiful color. You have to pour this vigorously to get the foamy head and lacing.. it might be ever-so-slightly under-carb’d, but that actually lends to the drinkability AND the flavors of this ofest. It has a little red ale in the nose, slightly metallic but not too off-putting, so at first, before the sip, I wasn’t sure. TheN this glorious ofest elixir hit my tongue, and wowza!!!!!

This beer tastes great. Cold, warm, no matter, but i think its better colder than some other versions of this style. Thats not necessarily a bad thing tho.. it slight lack of carbonation and the silkiness that makes it unique. Its very smooth and creamy in the taste despite the low carb and thinner body.. its a thin oil slick of ofest greatness. You have the big flavor spins like Sams or Great Lakes, and I love them both in their own way, but if i wanna pound a great ofest in massive seasion manner, give me Munsterfest. Im putting behind a classic like Ayinger, but for an American ofest, its originality, poundability, and viscosity, make it a bright shining star!!! This beer is fan-freaking-tastic, and more than any ofest in years, has me going back for more and more.. that night.. each week.. until they are available no more..",4.25

Export Lager,"On tap at The Sheffield in Brighton, NY.

This one pours a golden vibrant yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like biscuity and not too sweet malt, peppery hops, dough, and some grassiness.

This is two lager kings working together – of course it’s gonna be excellent. It’s got a real tight malt character to it – slightly doughy, toasty, and biscuity, with a light but well balanced grassy and slightly peppery hop character.

This is light bodied, super crisp and well attenuated, with a fantastic drinkability.

It’s hard to find much flaw here – East Coast lager excellence paired with Rocky Mountain lager excellence. What could go wrong?",4.5
Export Lager,"Pours a clear, rich golden color with a gorgeous fluffy white head that lasts, falling to a quarter inch cap with tenacious cling to the glass.

Sweet and toasty hits the nose first. It's a honey-like sweetness. The hops are floral and herbaceous with a slight grassiness and a very faint spiciness.

The taste opens slightly sweet with a bready malt flavor. Then there's a bunch of kids in this pool. The malt carries through, but there is a fairly strong hop note that leans more floral than the nose suggests. There's still some herbal grassiness, but not very pronounced. The sweetness starts to lean towards honey or maybe light brown sugar, and in the aftertaste it is almost a caramel flavor. There's just a hint of orange that I still don't notice in the smell, and the finish leaves a little peppery tingle behind that gets a little more pronounced on repeat sips. Everything rides on that malt backbone, though. It does have that flavor I am beginning to associate with decoction brewing but can't quite nail down - I suspect there's some browning reactions in that cooking process that bolster the toasted maltiness.

Light bodied, moderately carbonated, and the self-replenishing head lends it a slight foamy feel. Mildly bitter, fairly crisp, highly drinkable at 5.7%. Very nicely balanced on all the attributes.

Wow...not disappointed in this one at all. Worthy.",4.25

Export Lager,"Canned 7/1/22

Man, I haven’t had a Dortmunder in a long ass time. Now I find one that’s a collaboration between 2 of the kings of the American Lager brewing scene, Jack’s Abby and Bierstadt! Let’s see what happens when these 2 put their brains together for a rather obscure style

Pours a cloudy deep gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s wonderfully toasty and sweet in the nose, but there’s still a nice bite to it. I’m picking up on aromas of toasted grain, sweet honey, bready malt, herbal hops, orange zest, and light pepper

It leans a bit more into the sweeter aspect in taste which I don’t prefer but it’s still quite good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting bready malt, honey, herbal hops, dark toast, white pepper, toffee, and light orange rind. The swallow brings notes of toasted grain, sweet honey, bready malt, floral hops, white pepper, and light brown sugar

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp and refreshing beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slight hop bite

Samuel Adams Octoberfest,Pours a solid golden amber color with finger or two foamy head. Smells of a toasty caramel scented malt. Tastes the same with smoothness similar to a Irish red but slightly different. An absolute fall classic and is loved by most. There is a reason this is a common draft amongst establishments in the fall. Boston does it well with this Sam Adams seasonal.,4.5
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint shaker and had to pour in stages as the head was so aggressive. The color was beautiful copper with the manilla colored head, looks enticing.
The aroma was ideal for a Märzen style, the malts and caramel and touch of spice, oh, this smelled good.
The taste was okay, a letdown after the hard sell- the aforementioned malts were there but rather undefined. It was curious after the aroma was so spot on and the taste just dropped off. Weird.
The feel was excellent, no worries there.
Smooth and so easy to drink.

Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"I returned to SA Octoberfest after about 10 years away, and I can't say that the time has done it any favors. I remember a good quality Marzen with a nice flavor profile that, yes, sometimes had its off years, but on the whole was a steady performer in the American O-fest scene.

The only constant from the beer I remember is the great look, a beautiful dark amber. The rest just seems muddled. For me, the taste is a bit off, with a flat malt expression that doesn't have much character or depth, and too much bitterness on the finish. Maybe they've increased the hop bill to meet current tastes? Well it doesn't suite my palate. While nicely medium bodied, it has an unfortunate tendency to syrup-coat your mouth after the swallow.

Would I choose this over a lot of other standard party/bbq offerings? Absolutely. But with so many great, small craft options these days, it might be another 10 years before I buy SA Octoberfest again.",3.0
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Had on tap (alledgedly tapped yesterday) at Hoffbrau Bar and Grill in Westminster, CO

On arrival a fine one finger head was present that relatively quickly dissipated to a ring around the rim and very light covering. Carbonation is lazy and fine in a reddish brown amber body. No lacing.

Aroma has some nice lightly estery Germans tyle lager yeast with a very low hopping rate. A nice nutty roasted malt is peeking its head through pretty aggressively.

Taste is similar to the aroma with a low hopping rate, and a surprisingly flavorful but pleasant German style lager yeast that plays a big role here. Once the fermentation character passes a big wave of nutty roasted malts takes over.

Feel is insanely drinkable with a medium body for easy drinking but a bit more body for that oktoberfest. Very soft and smooth. Not the sweetest but the malts are mouthcoating. On the medium finish it starts drying out a bit.

Overall this is a very nice malty oktoberfest. Flavorful and it tastes German. Very light hops as per style, but it doesn't go great with hoppy amber lagers as I just found out.",3.75
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Created an account just to say that I agree with the review posted by ABeingWhoDrinksBeer in Dec 2021.

Overly malty and enough sweetness to ruin the brew. I also get a hint of chocolate, which doesn't work for me in a beer.

Looks good, but that's about it.

Unfortunately, the Pacific Northwest is awash in IPAs, which makes it hard for someone like me who's not a huge IPA fan to find a decent craft beer that isn't an IPA. I spotted this in Costco and figured, ""I like Sam Adams, how bad could this be?"" and proceeded to buy a case of 36 (!) bottles.

Tucher Festbier,"Picked up a four-pint pack. Canning date of 08/01/2022 -- very fresh!

Pours a crystal clear copper in color with hints of gold and a frothy finger-thick head atop that fades fairly quickly. A bit of lacing on the glass, some slides some clings. Carbonation looks average. Exactly as expected in appearance -- slightly darker than a helles hinting at a bit more flavor complexity and a bit less drinkability.

Aroma is bready malts, perhaps some rye, roasted corn, yeast, tea and lots of grassy, lemony hops. Seems to be pretty balanced on the nose, perhaps slightly hop forward. A bit earthy with a hint of alcohol and spice.

Taste follows the aroma well, if a bit more malty than expected. Roasted, rye malts up front with a spicy, hoppiness coming in towards the middle and into the swallow. Finishes with a spicy, lemon hoppiness and roasted maltiness on the tongue. A bit earthy overall and a tad sweet, but balanced out nicely by the roastiness of the malts and a hint of bitterness from the hops.

Medium bodied, this one drinks smooth with a hint of chewiness and light, zesty carbonation. Quite drinkable, but has a viscousness that tells me I probably shouldn't drink more than a few pints of this.

Another great brew from Tucher. This reminds me a lot of their helles. It's basically a stronger, more flavorful version of the same thing, which is exactly what I'd expect from their festbier. It's probably a bit sweet for my tastes overall, but I very much appreciate the quality of this. It's an excellent treat for autumn, it definitely feels like a brew of occasion.

Tucher Festbier,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden-amber color with a small head of white foam. The head has fades quite quickly, leaving very little lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is quite heavy of a grainy and bready smell mixed with aromas of caramel and some harvest fruits. Along with these smells comes a little bit of hay and yeast as well as a bit of herb and earthiness.
Taste – The taste starts out with a crisp grainy and cracker malt flavor that has notes of caramel and toffee sweetness. There is a little bit of yeast and pear, with both of these getting lighter as the taste advances. At the same time, as the taste advances, light herbal and earthy flavors join in, all while the graininess gets a bit more potent. Toward the end of the flavor transitions comes some straw and a bit more toffee/caramel, leaving one with a rather pleasant and crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average. For the style and the flavors, the feel is spot on and makes for a very nice drinker.

Tucher Festbier,"16 fl oz can from a ~$10 USD 4-pack.

5.8% ABV.

A bit too doughy in its yeast profile for me, distracting from the Munich malt honeyed sweetness. Too bready to be a beer I'd quaff by the litre (and quaffing by the litre is sort of the point of a festbier).

Still a nice brew, but not amongst the best German expressions of the style. This is currently rated #1 in the Festbier category, which I think is over-effusive, but it's drinkable and enjoyable, no doubt.

Tucher Festbier,"500 ml Can
Consumed on: 14 July, 2022
Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: 48.4 F


Look:
Golden yellow with a 2-finger frothy and pillowy white head. The head fades to about a half finger of bubbly foam. Lacing is good.

Smell:
Quite malty. Very bready and even doughy. There is a very light touch of honey and also lemon. Light touch of grass - both cut and uncut.

Taste:
Dialed down a notch or two from the nose but still quite good. Ant still malty. The malts come across as fresh baked bread and soft pretzels. The lemon note can be picked up in the background. There is a mild bitterness from the hops but it is just enough to cut into the malts and balance things out. The sip finishes very slightly dry. Very refreshing.

Feel:
Crisp and mostly clean. A tad chewy. Body is medium-light.

Overall:
A quite enjoyable and easy drinking Festbier. Nicely done. I could drink this all day long. This definitely earns its #3 rating (at the time of this review) and just might be my favorite Festbier to date.",4.25

Tucher Festbier,"pours a crystal clear gold body with a white froth head that has moderate retention and leaves specs of thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a thin slightly murky cap with small halo

aroma is crystal clear malty caramel, layered with a pizza dough like fluff and mild pretzel

taste is plenty malty but not quite as complex as the aroma, although a slight hop bitterness hits towards the end to balance it

mouthfeel is high carbonation and medium-light body that runs somewhat watery but manages chewy and finishes crisp and dry with a lightly malty and earthy hopped aftertaste

overall:
the malt layers are very interesting, standing out pretty nicely, and the hopped finish is a great transition",4.25
Tucher Festbier,"Poured from the can into a Libbey style pilsner glass.

Beaming brass yellow, with exceptional glass and mirror like clarity in the body, with light reams of carbonation. Head is bright white and fluffy looking, with a big four fingers and thick creamy retention and staying power. Just an all around bold and beautiful looking lager.

Real exceptional aroma. Big dough malts, and baked bread flavors, hints of light brown crust and exotic fresh milled grain. Kicks in a little pasty and sticky sensing, not the most clean but real solid and impressive nose.

Palate is real nice. Soft bodied moutfeel, light but like Spring water like consistency. A nice mid palate of toffee crispness that pushes all the right buttons. Finishes a bit dry grain, almost flour like, but much more flavors of caramel and soft toffee continue as the beer warms and drinking keeps flowing.

Real good festbier, will have to remember this one next time I see it.",4.25
Tucher Festbier,"a festbier from germany, thought i had previously tried most of them, so i was stoked to find this, been loving the style again this year and was eager to try an old world example of it, but this was a little disappointing, and while freshness may be part of the issue, this underwhelmed even aside from that, past mineral forward to almost metallic, thin, and pretty simple flavored by the lager yeast and some bittering hops, less malty than most, even as a festbier compared with a marzen lager, i can see a lot of potential for this, but it didnt hit for me the way i hoped it would, grabbed a four pack for all day drinking and ended up only having one can and moving on to some wet hop stuff, will circle back later this week, but it didnt take me where i wanted to go. i love the cans, label and size, and i love the price. the pour is pretty, clear and airy white headed, looks like a nice german helles, maybe a shade richer. the nose is light oxidation, aluminum, nutty european malt, and bread yeast to me, even lightly doughy, pretty minimal overall, noble hops there too, but its all relatively unexciting. the flavor follows, some grassiness from the hops, a tea note late, very dry throughout and not as flavorful on the grain side as it smells. the yeast its primary, along with the mineral profile, and overall it is missing something for me, maybe the crispness of a good helles, maybe the richness of a proper marzen, which i know this isnt, but its sort of in this middle ground or no mans land where its not quite defined. drinkable for sure, fizzy and lively in texture and quite light, but this just tastes a bit cheap to me, tired from its long journey here, and not a standout in the style unfortunately...

edit: upon further review, aka two more cans of this, i may have been a little too harsh on it, sure its a little thinner and lacks malt richness, but its not as metallic as i called it after the first one, more mineral forward to me now, and with pizza it was spot on. the freshness is still an apparent issue but the quality is higher than maybe i gave it credit for the first time around. bumping up a few scores now, context seems to be everything with this one...",3.75

Looking very good in the glass. Clear pale golden yellow body. Initial full white head shrinks to a collar and covering, scattered lacing.

Strong malty aroma, not an overly sweet smell.

On tasting, good malty taste, not too sweet. Well balanced, not so much with bitterness, though there is a hint of that, but by a strength and depth of flavor.

Mouth above medium, finish a little sweetness comes through, as does the abv.

Smooth balanced malt and supporting hops. Dry finish. Good carbonation.
Very good helles style Festbier.",4.25
Tucher Festbier,"500ml can poured into a dimpled mug.

A two finger white head caps the clear, rich gold pour. The very persistent head is comprised of both tight and loose soapy foam and leaves good lacing. The aroma is moderate strength, spicy hop over light toasted malt and some mineral notes. Taste is semi-dry and balanced slightly to hop front to back, bitterness is low but a mild bitterness does ring out in the brief aftertaste. Malt flavor is clean toasted malt while the hop flavor opens spicy and transitions to more floral with hints of citrus as the mug warms. Mouthfeel starts medium-light and crisp before smoothing to a heavier creamy finish. This is a great Oktoberfest though I find it a little sharp and the flavor profile to be more like a Marzen than a Festbier.",4.0
Tucher Festbier,"Golden amber body; excellent carbonation; thick and spongy white head, dense and rocky. Fine toasted malt nose.; a bit of earthy spiciness. Sublimely and subtly malty; toasted grain again. faint honey; low-key malt sweetness; low to moderate hop bitterness. Medium body; crisp and warm on the palate; nice touch of dryness at the finish.

This is a wonderful festbier, warm and nicely malty with just the right touch of hop bitterness to round things out.

Tucher Festbier,"A clear golden yellow color with a full head and nice white lacing. The nose is honey and grainy bread. It tastes of crackers, floral hoppiness, and pepper on the way out. This is so light and crisp. YUM! I could drink a few of these. Makes me want to eat.",3.75
Tucher Festbier,"This one pours a light orange-ish color, clear, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This one smells like grassy hops, honey, breadiness, and a bit of spice.

This has a light nice nuttiness and bready malt character, with a touch of grassy hop spice to it. I'd want a touch more crisp bite on the back end for the style, but it's still well done in this area of the Oktoberfest world.

This is light bodied, clean, crisp, and very drinkable, with a nice smooth finish.

This is a very nice pale take on the style.",4.0
Tucher Festbier,"From the bottom of the can: ""L 114710 10:10/02""

Appearance: The beer has a nice amber colored body with hints of burnished gold. Dark shadows with a very slight haze are visible through the body. The head is white and forms a solid disc of foam which become somewhat rocky as it fades. It had average retention and leaves a short white cap on top of the beer at all times. There are nice blotches of camouflage patterned lacing.

Aroma: There isn't a ton of aroma here; a mild cereal grain character giving off the impression of sweetness.

Taste: Up front there is a light bit of bread dough flavor. As it rolls along the sides of the palate towards the middle it picks up a light bit of spice. Mild alcohol note on the center of the tongue that is more noticeable at first but fades away while drinking the beer and between palate cleansing. Stale cracker character comes through a bit. A very mild herbal character towards the end of each sip but mostly absent of flavor at the finish and in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: It feels balanced on the edge of light and upper-light bodied depending on the sip. Very mellow bitterness. It is a very easy beer to drink.

Overall: This feels like a pretty average, lighter Festbier. It wouldn't be the first beer I would pick up for its aroma or flavor but it would be a decent beer to clank under a tent while dancing on benches or singing songs. It's not something I would buy again to drink at my house but I could drink it if that was what was being served at a tent.",3.0

Notes via stream of consciousness: So what do we have here? It's an Imperial chocolate peanut butter stout at 7.6% alcohol by volume. It doesn't say anything about ingredients on the label so it might just be flavoring. The body is an opaque brown-black and reveals only a glimmer of mahogany brown at the base of the glass when held to the light. The head is a finger's width of tan foam. In the nose I'm getting a lot of peanut and a little bit of milk chocolate. On to the taste... the nuttiness remains but it's no longer dominant. The chocolate that wraps around it is like a combination of milk chocolate and darker chocolate. They're clearly from a flavoring agent but that's fine by me as there are no weird or unusual notes to it. There's a light fruitiness to it as well but that's about it. It's not really roasty, and there's not a lot of bitterness to it. It's sweet but it's not overly sweet, and although you could easily serve this on it's own as a dessert beer or use it as an ingredient in something, you can just as easily enjoy it on its own. How quickly you'll work through it depends on how much you like the sweetness. For me the second half of the glass will definitely be a sipper. Thankfully they didn't add any lactose to it! In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. On that note, the head died down quicker than I'd have liked but it did leave some nice lacing about the glass so there's that. I think that this is a very nice beer that's fairly accessible. It's not too big nor is it too small, as in lacking flavor, and thus I think it should work for just about everyone. It is a bit one-sided though, but I guess it kind of has to be, right? I mean, they are going for a peanut butter cup thing, right? That's what the label implied to me. I generally buy a few special beers to enjoy on Halloween while the trick or treaters come and go, usually pumpkin beers, and this will make a nice change of pace.

All Hallows Treat,"Bought a pack of this so I'll definitely be able to revisit it. I hope my opinion changes because so far this is lowkey bad. There's not really a chocolate presence and smelled kind of astringent. The peanut butter is that typical peanut flour taste. Basically just seems like an off version of Left Hands PB Milk Stout which I also think could be better. It's also kind of fruity sweet? Idk. I hope I like it more as I get through it.


2nd can was a smidge better, not fantastic but none of that astringent smell or anything else super weird. Definitely liking it better.",3.75
All Hallows Treat,"Mercifully, these days, a pint can's contents can be emptied into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. Points should automatically be upgraded over the sea of starchy white foam ""heads"" brought by almost all modern ""IPAs"".There's a nice biege head on top of a liquid that's just a little lighter than the typical black coffee brown of a standard stout. The aroma is mostly dark chocolate and roasted peanuts. First off, this drinks less viscose than many stouts and much thinner than the dessert variety. That doesn't have to be a negative. One of the nice things about this brew is the subtleness of the peanut and chocolate flavor additions. They don’t totally override the Belgian Ale aspect, which keeps this in balance with the sweetness that usually accompanies this mixture. In a close decision, this is less sweet enough and has other characteristics that it shouldn't just be a categorized a dessert beer. There are other flavored stouts that deliver this combination of flavors, but they're usually heavy handed in doing so. This is a very pleasant option.",4.25

Consumed on: 14 July, 2022
Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: low to mid 50s F


Look:
Cloudy and opaque but bright copper. I can distinguish the shadows of my fingers through the glass but not much else. Initial 3-finger creamy off-white head slowly dissipates to a thin but consistent cover. Very good lacing.

Smell:
Toasted (but lightly so) whole wheat bread and biscuits. Light notes of toffee or caramel along with a medium-dark honey. Also faint notes of grass.

Taste:
Wheat bread with toffee and a surprising but actually light spiciness. Very nice. A mild bitterness carries through the sip which finishes dry. The 6.2% ABV is not noticeable at all.

Feel:
Smooth and crisp. Body is medium with a step to the lighter side.

Overall:
This beer isn't your average Festbier/Wiesnbier. As others have stated, it is actually a light Märzen. Or perhaps a cross between a Märzen and a Festbier with more of the Märzen in the mix. And it works. This is a really nice Oktoberfest beer. It drinks well and would pair with German fest food nicely. Bitburger must have learned something from their Oktoberfest collaboration with Sierra Nevada in 2019. Well done, Bitburger! Well done!

Note: When I poured this beer, I noticed some sediment in the bottom of the bottle so I did the 'Hefeweizen Swirl' to get it back into solution in the beer.",4.0

Festbier,"For how cheap it is you'd think it was an upscale adjunct lager, lo' and behold it is a good Festbier for Oktoberfest. Not a strict marzen, not a run of the mill bavarian but spot on for the clean crisp taste of a fest bier. Smooth, good brewing water, good malts and good mouth feel. I give it a 4.25. The look I scored 4 because it was not as dark as your standard red lager, but it was not yellow like a 2-row barley crap we have in america. White head, and good aroma made the smell a 4. Taste was well worth the price, i would give this another go and lookforward to Festbeer season. I am stocking up this time.",4.25
Festbier,"Pours dark ruddy amber (SRM 12-13). This is much darker than expected and, surprisingly, is it not clear. One inch of creamy pancake batter has an antique white to almond color and is short lived, leaving small patches of lace on a Spaten dimpled mug.

Initially, the aroma is bright. It quickly turns to wheat bread, with toasted grains and light spiciness. With minimal warming, peanut husks come into focus.

While modest, the bitterness and spice are far stronger than expected. Malts still dominate, with mild sweetness. Light toasted grain is similar to cream of wheat. A long, lightly bitter finish is rather grainy. Peanuts show up, again with warmth. With more warmth comes the clear flavor of soft pretzels.

This one has a medium body and a rough texture. Alcohol is as expected, as is the soft carbonation. There is a light astringency throughout.

Bitburger's Festbier is a fine beverage. Still, it is a letdown, if only because I had expected more. It will pair well with soft pretzels and bratwurst, more likely sweet mustard than spicy.",3.75

Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"Had on tap at Lucero's Tavern IV

On arrival, a 2 finger slightly fizzy head was present and slowly became rocky, but had a surprisingly good head retention, and formed lacing. Body is a brownish amber with lively fine carbonation.

I don't know if this is a shitty keg or what, but the aroma reminds me of pale super cheap bullshit malt liquor from Anhueser Busch. Super funky and really not clean at all. Aroma is reminiscent of gym socks with a vague hint of dark malt... maybe.

Taste is unfortunately similar to the aroma. This is like having sex in a canoe unfortunately, with a light malty heaviness that is easily confused for the funk that is present. This might even taste a bit skunky stupidly. I expected better.

Feel is slightly drying with a medium quick finish making all the bad parts of this beer not as bad, but a quick finish and high drinkability can't make up for the overall low quality in this beer. Decent feel but it's hard to feel good when you're smelling this.

Overall I'm not sure if this is just an old keg or if my bias against Dos Equis is justified, but this might be the worst Vienna Lager I've had in my life.

Obviously it tries to be a Dark Lager - it does remind you of that by the way it smells, looks and tastes. It does taste okay in the first monent but then BAM! it all starts fading away. A few minutes into the beer and it starts tasting and feeling like bitter water. And most of the time the arona was more like bread, no beer or hops, just bread.
Funny beer, I like Dos Equis for what it is, a cerveza. Maybe I should try the “real” ambar next - because this one wasn’t really cutting it.",3.5

Dos Equis Ambar Especial,A generic Mexican lager.,2.0
Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"Best By date : June 2022. Labeled ""Ambar Especial"" . Assume this is the same beer, as it's got the same abv, & blurb on the bottom of the label .

Clear , slightly orangey chestnut-brown, with slight, quickly-dissipating light tan head.

Smell is slight toffee and caramel, with a bit of fresh biscuity malt aroma when swirled. Not bad, just not much there.

Taste is light toasted nuts, and slight bread crust. A bit of tang, and weak amaretto flavor shows up as it warms to 50F(+/-) . Again, not bad, just not much there.

Feel is light, smooth, and slightly watery just before the light, very,very fine carbonation kicks in. Drying finish, that lingers afterward.

Overall, not bad, and no off-flavors, just kind of weak. Inoffensive enough to enjoy, if no other decent options available, especially in hot weather. Certainly better than its corn-laden brethren in the Light Industrial Lager vein. I'd rather have Yuengling or Negra Modelo though. ymmv",3.0
Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pour a medium to dark coppery amber with fine, two finger white head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of grainy and bready malt, light grassy hops, a little bit minerally. Flavor starts with pale and lightly caramel malt with some evidence of corn, light grassy hops; finishes with light grassy hops and thin malt. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I actually picked this up when finding it singled, thinking it was the regular lager, which I hadn't reviewed. (It is now named ""Ambar Especial""). It looks and tastes better than I remember the regular Dos Equis, which was a mediocre adjunct lager. It looks great in the glass, aroma is OK and the taste starts pretty decent, but thins out quickly into a finish that is satisfactory but tastes almost watered down. Expectations were low, and this is pedestrian brewing, but I have to say I'd prefer this in a pinch over the thin grassy regular lager. Nothing special, but I would grab one at a restaurant if nothing else was appealing.",3.5

Smell of sweet risen dough and roasted grain. There are caramel and grassy aromas, too.

Flavors of caramel malts and light grassy grain. No unpleasant aftertaste.

Hopcelot,"Consumed 8/19/22

Medium gold with orange hues, hazy but not turbid, pours with a medium sized off-white head, retains a few wisps and a small collar
An aggressive mix of a lot of hops, lots of citrus, orange and grapefruit juice, rind, orange marmalade, floral citrus, herbaceous and green hops, touch of resin, some dank notes, some stone fruit, over-ripe tropical fruit, something that smells like a cross between cherry skin and leather, pale malts, caramel malts, biscuit, above-average bitterness, more alcohol heat than I would expect for 7% but it works with the flavor profile
Medium body, smooth if not a little oily, medium carbonation

Lawson's really missed an opportunity to name this Liquid Hopcelot for the small demographic that would find the name amusing. Like Liquid Ocelot and many plot elements of Metal Gear Solid 4, I do not quite grasp what is happening with this beer. It's aggressive and hoppy, but it drinks like an out-of-focus picture.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a just slightly hazy golden body beneath a full head of white foam. The aroma clearly shows that there are some ""dank"" hops in play, but it's also earthy, herbal, floral, and piney. Interesting. It smells kind of like a damp forest. On to the taste... I didn't get the malt in the aroma but it's certainly here. It's sweetish and grainy, and I'm guessing that it's probably Pilsner malt. There's a grassiness to it that suggests Pilsner malt but it's pretty strong so it's got to be coming from hops too. That could be throwing me off on the malt although that richer graininess is still there. The hops remain earthy, herbal, floral and piney but there's also some fruitiness to it. I'm thinking gooseberry, white grape, passionfruit, nectarine, sweet berries, apple, pear, a bit of citrus, some apricot, and a touch of plum. My guesses for hop varieties would be Nelson Sauvin, Mosaic, and Simcoe although this beer uses 8 different hops so there have to be more. Ahh, you know what else might be in here? Summit hops. I get a little bit of that herbal, garlic, and onion thing they have going on in the nose. In any case I think you get the idea. A median bitterness balances it, working well against the sweetish and grainy malt, and it finishes mainly dry and bitter with herbs, woodiness, and a little bit of fruit lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp and then smooth. I'm quite impressed with this beer. It's unusual and unique.

Feel...a usual pillow juicy and sticky. Tons of lacing and full character yet so easy to drink

Taste is bitterness up front-earth and pine with juice in the background-citrus and mango. nice balance of juice and bitterness.

Pours a muddy pale gold color with a finger of fluffy, effervescent white head. Smaller head than expected, but the retention is real. Leaves a massive crown of lacing along the top of the glass.

Oh my dear lord the smell of this beer. How is there no fruit puree here? There's a nuclear amount of stone fruit, as well as some fresh mango, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit pith. The signature Tree House yeast is also very present with a hint of vanilla.

The flavor follows the nose to a T, but adds a nice vanilla bean character, as well as some melon and fruit stripe bubblegum. This is just stupid.

The feel is medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Creamy and pillowy soft. A hint of booze.

Overall, this beer is absolutely deserving of any hype it receives. I am a long admitted Tree House fanboy, but I'd consider myself well-versed with NEIPA's and can tell which ones are good and which ones are not, regardless of bias. This one is unquestionably good.",4.75

Aroma: Fresh baked brown bread, lightly toasted grains, melanoidin, toffee, wafts of dark fruit, bread dough, and light earthiness
Taste: Bread, dough, and grains intermingle up front and develop depth as toffee and earthy notes begin to weave their way in and join. Toffee holds center stage in the middle and oddly, the carbonation seems to dominate the dark fruit notes as I’m not getting much of them in the taste
Mouthfeel: Full, pretty high carbonation, clean, and a spritzy finish
Overall: I dig it. This is a tasty Dunkel and one I haven’t had in a while so it was fun to revisit. However, I feel like the carbonation needs dialing back a tad unless I just had an older bottle as it cut into several subtleties that the nose was alluding to but that seemed to instead be smothered by the spritzy and spicy carbonation. Still pretty good though",3.75
Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel,"Poured the color of strong tea and the light brown head was never more than a cm tall but for all the world the carbonation looked like I had just poured a Coke.
The aroma, as for most to my poor, damaged nose, was mild. Only impressions of malts made it through. (Hence I seldom mark higher or lower)
The taste was not what I was expecting. Certainly very tasty and had elements of a dunkels that I have had in the past, but far lighter in density of flavor (if that makes sense) Still, it was quite refreshing and served its purpose well.
The feel I was less than amazed by - it certainly wasn't bad, but I think maybe the bottle I had was either old or something as despite the cola looking carbonation there was almost no carbonation ""bite"" in this for me, which helps cut through the thirst, ya know?",4.0

Glass: 0.5L Fest Mug
Pouring Temp: 48.7 F


Look:
Chestnut brown that is difficult, but not quite impossible to see through. I can vaguely see my fingers through the glass, especially when I hold the mug up to a light. The beige/light tan head is initially 2+ fingers (it fills the remainder of the glass) but quickly dissolves to a ring and a very thin cover. The lacing is decent.

Smell:
Rich dark malts. Lightly toasted dark bread. Semi-sweet or even milk chocolate that is a hint dry (like a chocolate powder).

Taste:
Follows the nose. There is an earthy note here. Also some metallic notes that tell me that this beer is showing its age (its bottle date is 37 months ago). A light bitterness and tartness can be found in the background. Each sip finishes somewhat dry and slightly bitter or astringent.

Feel:
Soft with the aforementioned slightly astringent finish. Medium body.

Overall:
A pretty solid and good Dunkel. Easy to drink and would go well with food, especially German food. Unfortunately, this bottle is a tad old, and is starting to show its age. This beer is better than what my rating indicates. I will re-review and update my rating(s) when I get a fresher bottle.",3.75

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Yet, a large, bready, mouthfeel. A silky, smooth and creamy finish. (3.75))

Overall: This one just keeps getting better. The appearance was impressive. The nose was very nice and bready. Then on the flavor is when you really appreciate this one. It nails you with the deep and dark bready notes, cocoa, complex dark malt flavors, but goes back to the relying on the bread for the finish, without being too sweet.

The sweetness in the nose here is intense and very round in character. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet honey, toasted grain, bready malt, apple skin, caramel, and light white pepper

Unfortunately it shows its age in taste much more, but it’s still quite good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting doughy malt, apple skin, peppery hops, caramel, and brown bread. The swallow brings notes of brown bread, honey, caramel malt, and herbal hops

Delicious IPA,"Pours a golden amber in color with minimal head and lacing as you drink. Carbonation looks average. Reminiscent of a Stone IPA, but with less head.

Aroma is not overly pungent, perhaps I should let it warm a bit (the malts come through a bit more as it warms, but otherwise much of the same). Picking up notes of citrus and tropical fruits with some earthiness, spice and a hint of bubble gum in the background. Alcohol is slightly detectable at 7.7% ABV.

Flavor is very predominantly hops across the full spectrum. Starts off with a little bit of balance with the toasty, biscuity malts and quickly climaxes with a pine resin and grapefruit rind hop avalanche that coats the tongue. I'd imagine the malts are a bit subdued due to the gluten reduction process. This is certainly a palate wrecker, but it's pretty tasty.

Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium bodied with smooth, zesty carbonation and a ton of chewiness. She thicc. The hop oil definitely coats the tongue after the swallow. I would not want to drink more than a few of these for fear of a hangover, but I quite enjoy the mouthfeel otherwise.

Overall this is a powerfully hoppy, reduced gluten brew. If you're not into hops, this is definitely not for you, but if you are, it is has a very fresh and pungent hop flavor that is sure to please. I think I prefer the Stone IPA over this one, but I definitely wouldn't turn it down if offered. Even with the high hoppiness it feels pretty gentle on the stomach. Another good one from Stone, cheers!",4.0
Delicious IPA,Lovely bitter flavour,4.5
Delicious IPA,"A medium dark golden amber is immediately noticeable upon the pour. Medium sized head formed with some lacing remaining. This is definitely a lemony, citrusy IPA. It's more like a floral lemon than a grapefruit citrus, but it is noticeable bitter to the point of being resinous, as there is an IPA bite that is bitterly refreshing with a full bodied carbonated feel which borders on syrupiness. There is a noticeable lack of maltiness between the hopiness, which could be a result of the gluten reduction, but who knows. It's very boozy, you could feel the booze hit you on the first sip. Overall it was as described, but the lack of malt may have deprived some padding from bitterness. A purveyor of hops would enjoy.

Blue Hen Pilsner,"It's a beer. I tried the same brewery's 90 Minute IPA (an easy almost-all-fives beer) for the first time right before this one, so maybe the bar is just too high now, but this is... it's a beer. I feel much the same way about this as I do Blue Moon and all the Samuel Adams beers: It's by no means bad, I get why it's on the shelf, and it is what it says it is. But I find myself yearning for something more, and especially with Dogfish Head, I've come to expect something more.
Straw-colored with disappointing head and no lacing. Smells sweet, tastes sweet. Fruity, almost, but not quite- something in my head goes ""strawberry?"" but then goes ""huh. no"". No comment on the malt. It's there. More malt character would be nice. The flavor is fine, but one-dimensional, and then there's an indescribably funny aftertaste. I was hoping for layers, and I did not get them. Mouthfeel's a mixed bag. It's nicely carbonated. I wish it was lighter.

Blue Hen Pilsner,"been some time since i had a new dogfish head beer, this is a cool pils, done with delaware grain, not sure i knew that was a thing. its a pretty basic beer, especially for these guys, but it is supremely well made and a real drinker, a good addition to their lineup and one that should stick around, a smart and appropriate entry point sort of beer for these guys. golden in the glass with pretty good clarity and an average height but fading white head. it smells awesome, somewhat more robust than a lot of these, and still kind of european on the grain even though it isnt, it has deep earthiness, even some german sort of dustiness to it, and to me seems fresher and higher in minerals than a lot of these, bold but still not heavy, if that makes sense. the yeast is also a little bit european, obviously a lager strain and obviously patiently worked, and the taste and mouthfeel confirm what the aroma suggests. the hops are pretty reserved, especially for these guys, they seem noble but maybe a little piney thing there too, all on the swallow, and still well behind the contributions of the grain and the yeast, even the water chemistry. i think the grain fits for the style but also brings something a little unique, call it terroir, to this, and they were smart to not dry hop over it or anything. i like how dry this is too, and even though it might feel just a touch watery, there is a lot to like about the texture too. nice four season pils here, just unique enough, infinitely drinkable.",3.75
Blue Hen Pilsner,"I just wanted to preface by saying this was on sale, maybe closeout? I didn't want to charm it by looking at the age, so I'm not sure about that. In any event, this is pretty good, not sure why it's received so many mediocre reviews. I just finished the work week, prepping some dinner stuff and this is good. First sip really reminded me of the opening of JA's Sunny Ridge (which is literally perfect). It sort of plays simpler from there, there's a noble hop bite, a good malt body. It's hazy, not sure why? Maybe a really short lagering so it's not fined or perhaps it's just a zwickel in a sense. In any event, easy drinking, rounded, great option if you're a lager person. If you're into DFH and only really drink their hoppy offerings/stouts, maybe this won't resonate, and that's perfectly fine, just like the beer.

Give it a try. It's (surprisingly enough) a great beer.",4.25

Notes via stream of consciousness: Blue Hen Pilsner... that name sounds familiar. There used to be a Blue Hen Beer Co. that contract brewed out of the Lion in Wilkes-Barre, PA but I'm not sure they ever made a Pilsner. That was way back. Well, good for Sam to take up the state bird again! It's poured a surprisingly hazy golden body beneath a short head of white foam. Why would they not filter this? I doubt it's dry hopped. Anyway, the head doesn't hold up that well but we'll see how the lacing turns out later. The aroma is clearly of rich, grainy Pilsner malt and grassy, spicy, herbal, and floral hops. The malt is lightly sweetish and there's a touch of an apple and citrus-like fruitiness to it. On to the taste... as you may have expected it tastes just like it smells but stronger and with an added bitterness. The malt is rich without being overdone, sweetish, grainy, and grassy. The hops are spicy, grassy, floral, and herbal. There's a delicate touch of lemon to it. The bitterness is median, and it finishes dry and hoppy. They've certainly nailed the Pilsner style here, and this is better than a lot of the Pilsners that I've had in Germany and the Czech Republic. This is, of course, a Czech style Pilsener but there are plenty of German breweries producing the style as well. In the mouth it's medium bodied on the lower side, and it's crisp with a fine-bubbled, standard carbonation. The drawbacks then? The slight haze, the lack of head retention, and what's turned out to be limited lacing as well. Otherwise this is a great Pilsner that I'd turn to all of the time if the price was right.

Blue Hen Pilsner,"L - Poured from a can into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass at around 45 - 50 degrees. Pale straw color. 1+ finger head on aggressive pour. Faded to a soapy looking film. Not really any lacing. Opaque Hazy when looking through. The look isn’t very appealing.

S - Smell is more appealing than the look. Grain scents. Light malt. Faint citrus. Cereal scents as well. Still very light scents overall though.

T - Taste follows scent. A little bitterness from citrus. Even a little floral. Very light grain malts. Not too complex. Those are the flavors. Actually. More lemon comes through as it warms up.

F - Some carbonation. Soapy consistency. Thin.

O - This is an okay beer. Not offensive, but doesn’t wow you. Perfectly fine for camping or drinking after working in the yard. I wouldn’t put this in my regular rotation though. It came in a variety pack with Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, 90 Minute IPA, (and the Slightly Might which I haven’t tried.) 60 Min and 90 are great beers, and I’m not really a big IPA fan.

Well, it's clearly past December, but this one was given to me for free. It was supposed to be a variety pack exclusive, but it seems all the stores around me were breaking up the packs to make this one available in single cans. I think that's a good mood personally but I doubt DFH would be fans of a move like that

Pours a hazy pale yellow with a finger of white head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There's still some bite in the nose despite the age, and it's quite nice. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon zest, grassy hops, toasted grain, crackery malt, white pepper, and a touch of honey

Taste wise it's a touch too sweet for me. I know that's basically the distinction in this style of Pilsner, but I think this one overdoes it just a tad, even if only up front. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting honey, bready malt, grassy hops, and light diacetyl. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, pear skin, crackery malt, herbal hops, toasted grain, pepper and light honey

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp and biting beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent balance

I'm a bit surprised by the lower ratings on this one. Despite the sweetness I already mentioned, it's pretty damn solid, even out of code. I'll have to try it again fresh",4.0

Smell: Light chocolate, moderate toastiness but a big drizzle of molasses. Sweet-smelling vanilla sugar with a milky twang about it and a persistent raisiny tone.

Taste: A rather sweet albeit unsurprising commencement with notes of toasted dark breadcrust, subtler roasted malts, bitterish chocolate powder, Grandma's molasses and vanilla followed by a little glug of whipping cream. Port-soaked raisin clafouti through the smooth, glossy finish.

Double Milk Stout,"I am a brewer and have been for 25+ years now. An important note;
Karl Strauss was my friend and he taught me how to critique a unique brew.
I am not easily impressed, I would like to say that Coffee and Milk Stouts are my personal loves in small batch brews.
Mr Strauss recommended one of my milk stouts to the LA Octoberfest an number of years ago. I would very much like to meet and shake the brewer or brewers hands who created this wonderful dark liquid concoction. The color is deep, the bouquet is amazing, mouth is a tiny bit light for me but very quick to finish and the flavors of the double milks are superb.
I am not ashamed to say this Milk Stout rivals all of mine. Bully! for you I say...

Double Milk Stout,"Smooth, silky and dangerously drinkable, Left Hand Brewing slides its double-digit alcohol percentage nicely behind the malts, milk sugars and gentle roast to tease their beer drinking audiences with a taste that's chocolate milk for adults.

Generally black and layering patiently into the glass, Double Milk Stout releases a classic dense froth of slightly tanned hues. Holding firm throughout the session, the bubbles host a scent that's creamy, roasty, chocolaty and vanilla-like. Similar in its early sweetness, the taste is soothingly sweet and malted with chocolate, toffee, caramel, honey and a general nougat character.

As the sweetness slowly retreats, its roasted elements increase to form an impression of smooth espresso roast, burnt toast, roasted nuttiness and a turn from milk chocolate to something more of the bittersweet variety. Soft and woodsy bitterness decorates the late palate and hits that notion of dark roast coffee home.

Smooth, creamy and warming heading into finish, a late spice of broad and woodsy bitterness offers a taste of char with kahlua spice, warm cream and a long linger of sweet, chocolate-like roast for a savory, velvety session meant sipping but you've got to watch yourself. This beer is super drinkable.",4.0

Double Milk Stout,"From the neck of the bottle in yellow text: ""BEST BY:08/19/22""

Appearance: It has a black body with a short, creamy textured, light tan head. The head is short, about half a thumb, but it stays up nicely. Some spotty lacing.

Aroma: There is a light aroma of malt and a slightly stronger scent of alcohol.

Taste: Up front it tastes like alcohol, burnt caramel, raisins, and brown sugar. The middle of the palate is full of dark fruit characters like raisins, plums, and dates. All of these comingle with a light toasted flavor and a touch of brown sugar character. It tastes a bit like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale but without some of the sweeter notes, and a slightly more toastier character.

Mouthfeel: It is medium-full bodied and slick. It is a sipper given the obvious presence of alcohol.

Overall: The label states that this contains ""Ingredients: Rocky Mountain water, malted barley, lactose, dextrose, flaked oats, hops, yeast."" It also states that this is ""10.5% ALC/VOL."" It is a simple beer with a lot of complex flavors, however it also shows the high alcohol content.

Double Milk Stout,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter
Appearance – The beer pours a super dark brown, nearly black color with a small head of tan colored foam. The head fades almost instantly, leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big and inviting, with lots of milk chocolate, crème, and coffee like aromas. At the same time there is a nice dark roasted malt smell as well as sweet vanilla and caramel smells. Aromas of a warm boozy smell mix in, along with a bit of brown sugar, char, and raisin, giving rise to an overall sweet and warming smell.
Taste – The taste begins with a rather sweet milk chocolate latte flavor that has a strong backing of brown sugar and cola, with some light fruit sweetness of cherry and raisin. Upfront there is also a bit of char and roasted malt, but these are rather subdued in light of the heavy sweeter flavors. As the taste moves forward however, the roast and char become a bit more pronounced, while the milk chocolate fades a bit. At the same time the sweeter cola flavor gets more pronounced, and with a bit of a boozy rum like taste, and a surge of a vanilla marshmallow like flavor, one is left with a warming and sweet taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the thicker and heavier side with a carbonation level that is on the low side. For the rich flavors and style the feel is good and makes for a dessert like sipper.
Overall – A rather potent and sweet stout. A little unbalanced on sweet:roastiness ratio, but overall not bad and one to at least give a try to.",3.75

Taste - bitter earthy, floral, and grassy hops upfront. The bready and biscuity malts alongside the lemon come through next. The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes sticky from the hops with the bready notes lingering as well.

Overall - A very quaffable festbier. I can see why this is drunk in high volumes in Germany on Oktoberfest. This one is quite flavourful as well. Glad I could try one of the official brews of Oktoberfest.",4.25

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"This brew two years ago was OUTSTANDING. But I noticed last year it changed. Like many others it was cheapened, hence the drop in quality and taste. It is still pretty good, (sorry cannot be more illustrative) not bad for the style, but unfortunately it went from arguably the best of the Marzen creed to very average. It use to have a wonderful aftertaste that dangerously incited you to drink large amounts of it, but now, after one or two you're like; meh. And then the despair as you remember what it was like in the recent past. This opinion is not just mine, but shared by a few I know, friends that know this style of beer, to bar managers that order it. They too share my dismay. Sad. For the price of this beer there are others that are better and cost less.",3.5
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,This is definitely rated lower than I would have thought. On my own personal experience I found this really good and definitely an accurate representation of the style. Maybe not greatest in the world but idk I was satisfied.,4.0
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"A clear, golden yellow beer in the glass with a thin, straggly head.

Aroma-wise there's bread and some floral notes that foretell of the balance and drinkability to come.

In the mouth there's a beautiful balance of mild bitterness, subtle floral hops, an ever-so-slight corn note and retronasally soft creaminess that demands another sip.

There's a reason this is drunk all day long in one-litre vessels. The alcohol is hidden, the beer is refreshing and the whole experience synergises into something greater than all of the parts.

Perhaps it's the romance of the style or the aura of the festival that lends this beer its name, but whatever it is, I want another one!

Cheers!",4.5
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"My first shot at an Oktoberfest bier! Pours a rich golden straw colour, a one inch head quickly appears and disappears within a minute. Regardless, it looks very nice in the tall glass. Unlike many pils I’ve had in this glass, the bubbles are enormous, streaking upwards in multiple lines. Would’ve looked absolutely gorgeous with a thick rocky head.

Straightforward aromas of wheat, bready malt, and some sparing citrusy but mostly grassy hops.

Right away this beer hits you with very typical taste profiles, and yet, there is a deliciously subtle and relatively complex smattering of tastes in the background. Up front is grain and toasty bread, a little bit of juicy corn. The malty notes balanced by an oh so gentle bitterness from the hops. What are those notes in the background? Fairly hard to differentiate, but they add up to a mildly savoury character. It’s a little bit nutty, a little bit floral, and a little bit earthy. They coalesce to make a savoury, earthy backing to the grassy grains that are more up front. A little bit of esters on that fruity note.

Tastes quite nice with a mild finish on the palate that is basically just bready malt, there is strong carbonation here that foams at the sip, it doesn’t become too creamy or heavy, but just eminently drinkable. The higher abv% is not noticed whatsoever. I doubt anyone would be able to tell if this was a 4% pils, a 5.5% lager, or the 6.3% brew it is. Medium-light bodied that finishes dry and sweet, this is a tasty drink.

Overall — a really good festbier. If this is a good example of the style, I can’t wait to try more. I’ll admit this was a long wanted find for me. I’ve been hunting the entire Hofbrau line in Canada for a long time. Hofbrau Oktoberfest was only at 4 stores at the LCBO, most having one or two left. I went to all 4.

Nothing. The leftover was just artifacts in the LCBO online system (someone probably shoplifted them). So to my surprise, I found it randomly at a North York LCBO that didn’t even have it listed. I bought all four that were left. Glad I did, you could easily drink all four in a single sitting. The design really draws you in, a nice brown bottle with classy and understated labelling. The Oktoberfest has inviting autumnal tones of orange and a nice scene on the front.

This beer has a little something going for it that is hard to put a finger on. It is definitely unique and does not taste like a typical lager or Pilsner despite having the same hallmark flavours. I really enjoyed this, the flavours are just so well balanced and in tune, it would be easy to mistake this for a general, slightly above average beer. But there’s much more going on!

JUNE 13th DRINK:
Had the last of my Oktoberfest biers, likely the last we’ll see until, well next October! I stand by the review and despite the beer being a few months older now, it’s just as fresh and drinkable. Smell increasing from original 3.25 to 3.5, it smells just fine! Feel increased from 3.75 to 4. It’s crisp and delicious.",3.75
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"I’m going to be as objective as I can but it’s going to be difficult. Rewind back to the halcyon days of 2009, I was traveling to Germany to visit some folks of a friend of mine. I was 20 years old and a year before I joined BA.

Eventually we wind up at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. Sitting at the giant tables, eating white sausage and getting housed off of 2 liters of beer was one of the most phenomenal drinking experiences I’ve ever had. I will always have an affinity for the brand, but I will try to keep it legit.

My attempt to keep it legit is evident in the appearance. It sucks. It pours a weak straw color with some good head.

Aroma is of oh so smooth caramel malts and breast undertones

Tastes of biscuits, caramel, some dark fruit in the finish with some metallic tones bringing it down a bit.

Mouthfeel is sharp and refreshing

Overall it’s a beer greater than the sum of its parts. It’s a decent beer to drink in the fall season but nothing spectacular.",3.75

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"This is my current favourite beer. My near perfect rating may be out of step with the others here, but I don't care. For me, this is beer done right. The colour is lighter than you might expect for a Märzen, though I guess we're now making a distinction between Festbier and Märzen, in which case it's about average compared to most of the other Munich Six: clear deep gold, with a frothy white head that has surprisingly long retention considering the high ABV. The smell and taste, however, are ""darker"" than the colour would suggest. On the nose, the first impression is a very deep, nutty, bready malt, with a hint of caramel, and something spicy. The taste starts the same way, with a beautiful and richly complex malt profile, very distinctively nutty, with the impression of dark, chewy bread, subtle and subdued caramel malt, followed up by a lovely earthy hops that is deep and rich, rather than bright and zesty or bitter, and a gentle spicy pepper hops finish. I can't stress enough how well it all works together. The ingredients must have been so carefully considered to construct such a perfectly balanced flavour profile, which nevertheless has a very distinctive character. The malts are smooth and deep without being too rich or sweet, and the hops profile affirms and strengthens this ""middle of the tongue"" balance. It's perfection. The mouthfeel is very smooth, slightly creamy, exactly middle weight, not too heavy for a hot day nor too light for a winter night - this beer is Balance in a Bottle, without being boring. The alcohol content is seamlessly disguised, and I mean seamlessly, to the point of being dangerous. You would not guess it's 6.3% as you were drinking it, and if you didn't know that going in, by the time you realised how strong it was it would be too late. Almost a shame, because I would love to be able to drink more than one of these with supper and still be able to have a sober evening, but alas. Overall, this for me is the perfect beer for any and every time, because it is so perfectly ""in the middle"" of so many ratios: sweetness to dryness, malts to hops, complexity to drinkability. Hofbräu has achieved the Golden Ratio with their Oktoberfestbier, and I say Prost to that.",5.0
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"On tap at Das Beer Garden. Clear deep golden. Smells a little bready with hints of floral hops. Tastes of sweet bread with light toasted notes.

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Today is a new beer to me.

Hofbrau – Oktoberfestbier

6.3% ABV

The beer is listed as an Oktoberfest festbier on the label – and listed as “Lager – Festbier / weisnbier” on BA. I have no earthly idea what a weisnbier is.

The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 weeks. Beer poured into a classic Hofbrau dimpled stein. Consumed over a 40ish minute period while eating a brat with german mustard and barrel kraut.

First Impression: Quite beautiful; pours a wonderful hay/straw golden yellow with a nice head. 4.35

Appearance: Beer is quite clear, but perhaps not as clear as one might hope or expect. Maybe that expectation is unrealistic, but my feelings for a festbier are similar to (approaching) those for a pilsner with it being quite clear. Beautiful color, although perhaps a shade darker than expected. 4.6

Smell: As is always the case for me with Oktoberfest beers, this one isn’t particularly fragrant. I get a very light bready nose, and then something I can’t quite identify. It’s a little sweet. Again (see taste below), I get some Belgian esters that no one else seems to get. 4.0

Taste: Much to my surprise, this is actually quite nice for a festbier. I’m normally not one for festbiers, as I traditionally find them quite pale – and more pale than I prefer. There’s almost no discernable hop presence. I’d argue this is almost like a cross between a marzen and a festbier, but I’m no expert. I still get some of the Belgian esters that others don’t get (specifically some bubblegum and clove). Only a small amount of yeasty, bread, crust flavor – not as much as I’d prefer. 4.35

Mouthfeel: Nothing special. Mostly classic, but thicker than I’d prefer, especially for a festbier. I’d prefer if this were a bit more crisp, which I normally associate with festbiers. 3.85

Overall: Not a lot to add. This is good, but perhaps not everything I would look for in a festbier. Truth be told, I purchased this by accident, since I usually enjoy marzens more than festbiers due to the hop presence. By that metric, I should like this, but it’s just not hitting the spot (both for me personally and for what I think this beer should be). It is going quite well with the brat and kraut, however. 4.0

BA Review Score: 4.161",4.0
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Clear golden pour with two fingers of white foam, no lacing oddly enough. German yeast dominated nose with malt sweetness in an airy way. Taste is more complex with a bready and mild caramel malt flavor complexion with a kiss of honey, but yeast character suffers.

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Bottled 4/5/21

Just as I was complaining that Half Time sent way more Märzens than Festbiers in the mixed pack, I open the fridge and find a Festbier! This one doesn’t really have great ratings, but at least it’ll be a nice change of pace from the overly sweet Märzen I just had from Blue Point. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a clear bright gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Well, despite the change up in style, this is still overly sweet in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of bready malt, earthy hops, toasted grain, sweet caramel, white pepper, and honey

It’s at least saved in taste, where there’s more of a firm bitterness. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pale malt, spicy hops, toasted bread, white pepper, and a touch of caramel. The swallow sweetens up a bit, bringing notes of overripe pear, caramel malt, earthy hops, and toasted grain

A medium body pairs with moderate scrubbing carbonation, resulting in a crisp and refreshing beer. Finishes off dry but a bit too sweet

I think this one is pretry good. Quite up there in alcohol for the style but it doesn’t feel like it. I could throw back quite a few of these",3.75

T- sweet and malty up front with notes of caramel and toasted brown bread. Mid-palate gives some floral hops before finishing with a hit of sweet caramel that lingers long after

Oktoberfest,"Appearance: Pours a clear, dark amber, almost copper color with a moderate off-white head. SRM of 14-15. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of brown bread malt, rich caramel, some scotch and booze with darker fruit mixed within. Rich and boozy.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of brown bread malt, rich caramel, booze, scotch, and some dark sweet fruit undertones. A sweet, boozy finish.

Feel: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation, somewhat appreciable. Soft, but boozy-like flavor lingers.

It's too boozy, not unlike Bitburger's Festbier without the authentic German flavors.

Overall: A decent Oktoberfest here. Brown bread and caramel malts mixed with scotch and booze. Sort of reminds me of a light Dirty Bastard from Founders. Enjoyable and flavorful, but I think it sort of misses the style a bit. (Rating: 3.63)",3.5
Oktoberfest,"Attractive appearance (as I believe most O'Fests are). Clear deep amber, bordering on copper, with a large off white head and a fair amount of lacing.

The aroma is rich toasted malt and light caramel with a bit of breadyness to it. Seems a little sweet on the nose but does have a bit of spicy hop scent too.
First sip reveals a light crisp textured body that is very easy to drink and i find my glass getting empty fairly quickly.
Medium carbonation that gently rolls across my palate only adds to the easy drinking here.

T - Taste brings the same; some crusty bread malts, green apple, herbal earth, mineral water. Notes of cream & green apple linger on the finish. The bottle does say this was brewed with hop extracts in addition to actual hops, but any fresh or piney, or i guess ""American"" hop flavors are absent. Typical taste per the style I'd say.

M - Feel is smooth, medium-light in body, easy drinking. Apt carbonation. I just burped.

Overall, an easy drinking beer from this German brewery, I'd be interested in trying more from them, and also in trying more beers listed under the Festbier heading. A nice intro the this style.

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 5/10/22, so 4 months old.

Looks nice enough, clear golden amber body with a decent white head. This persists in lesser form throughout leaving scattered lacing.

Malty aroma with a touch of old bread.

On tasting, clean, slightly sweet, smooth, mostly malty with a fleeting hop note.

Mouth above medium, finish slightly drying.

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"Simply speaking this is a very nice Festbier, and in such it’s a nice alternative to endless Märzen that are presented to us as Oktoberfestbeer. In recent years (meaning: decades), beer style at the actual Oktoberfest, at other fall beerfests such as Stuttgarter Wasen etc. have shifted from the heavy, dark and sweet Märzen towards the more easily drinkable Festbier style. In Germany at most of these events, Festbier is what everyone drinks. Märzen has become a niche in that regard. My personal preference is (by far) the Festbier style, and not the Märzen.
If you want to compare to understand what that difference actually is, get a sixer of Paulaner Oktoberfest Beer and a sixer of Oktoberfest Märzen. Both good, I just happen to line the non-Märzen better. Allgäuer Büble Festbier is a very nice example of this style.",4.0
Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,A nice amber color that seems to be hazy like an IPA but without the bite back of a hoppy bier. It keeps a foamy head and has a smooth taste. In keeping with fest style biers i recommend drinking a liter glass...or two!,4.25

$2.79 @ Foodery Beer, Phila., PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a clear deep amber body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The aroma is gently malty with bready notes and a touch of caramel backed by softly herbal hop notes. On to the taste... it's fuller than the aroma suggests but it basically follows suit. The malt is lightly sweet, grainy, bready, and softly caramelish and the hops are softly herbal and spicy. A moderate to median bitterness balances it and it finishes with just a dollop of sweetish malt lingering amidst spicy, grassy, and herbal hops that eventually fade to leave just bitterness behind. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. The lacing held up well and it's left some nice lacing with wide patches surrounded by smaller streaks and spots. It's readily accessible and highly quaffable because it straddles the fence between being delicate and being satiating.

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"12 ounce bottle, packaged 02.06.21, best by 02.09.22 stamped on the back label. Possible it was packaged in June 2021 since European brews sometimes goes day/month on their packaging but I'm not 100% sure of that. Thanks to Brutaltruth for this! Served in a dimpled mug, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, it's a sweet smelling brew that smells mostly like biscuity/bready malt, along with some honey and floral/earthy hops. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some caramel noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with a good amount of carbonation.

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"From the bottle in a snifter. This excellent fest pours a clear
light amber / brass color with a fantastic head of white foam that

malts. Flavors exceed the nose with a fine presentation of light
breaded malts amongst some floral and light herbal hops amidst
light toffee and caramel malt notes. Nice mouth feel; medium light

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"A new one for me. Have had other Allgäuer beers before, but the Büble Fest is a new one.

12 ounce import -- interesting. Packaged 02.06.21, Expires 02.09.22. Poured into my tall Becher.

L -- Clear, deep brassy gold with a dense, firm white head that leaves good lacing.

S -- Mellow herbal hops with light DMS and a bready malt backbone -- even some melanoidin showing.

T -- Good blend of herbal hops and bready melanoidin with the first swallow. There's a dry yeasty character very reminiscent of Paulaner Amber Märzen. Finish is spicy bitterness and nice melanoidin character in the aftertaste. The hop bitterness is bolder than the malts, but it still invites another gulp. There's also an underlying white grape note, common in German beers using good malts and a good mash.

M -- Mouthfeel is soft to slightly syrupy with a crisp, dry finish. Body is light-medium to medium.

O -- A little different take on Festbier with its hop note being a bit more prominent than usual -- maybe a bit too hop-heavy for my tastes in Festbier, but it's a great drinker and doesn't stunt the palate. A Fest/Märzen hybrid with its color and body. Worth a try for its good malt character.",4.0
Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"Perfectly clear bronze body with tow fingers of frothy white head. This was the highlight of the beer. Nose has skunkiness atop caramel malts, sweet corn and sweet grains. Taste is worse, euro macro malts, corn, sickly sweet caramel notes and light herbal skunk on the finish.

T: Briefly malt forward and lowly sweet to start, honey and cracker, floral/herbal hop flavor rising to the finish, very low bitterness, increased but mildly bitter aftertaste, sharp and dry overall
F: Lightly crisp, builds a little frothiness in the middle, has a slight tongue coating feel
O: OK, seems overly sharp for a Festbier and perhaps leans toward a Marzen.",3.5
Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"Poured from the bottle into a Libbey style pilsner glass.

Beautiful looking lager, with a brass gold and chestnut hued clarity for the body appearance, maybe even a faint touch of red squeaking out in the darker areas. Capped with a great looking cream top, nice white not yellowed and not bright bleach like either. This 2 finger top sits nicely with slow settling and some good spider legs of lacing too.

Aroma seems different. A very noticeable ester of banana getting into more of a hefe clove quality. Clean, with light touches of crisp toffee also. The banana seems misplaced but not in a bad way at least.

Palate continues more of this banana flavor but still provides fest character. Clean mid palate, quite fruity actually somewhat with a toffee mix and almost banana and berry sweetness. Mild sensing hop, a bit of hinting pasty sticky lager flavor just by a hair in the finish. Mild sense of spicy herbal classic hop in the mix.

Interesting festbier, kind of sticks out uniquely, but the fruity estery nature of it I find just a hair distracting.",3.75

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with a little biscuit, sweet bread and a little grassy malt, similar to a Märzen. Flavor is caramel biscuit malt with some graininess, wheat bread and grassy hops. Slightly astringent, but moderate bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I guess these Festbiers are a mellowed out Märzen style. This one smelled like the latter to me. The flavor has less of the sweet caramel and more grainy biscuit. Grassy continental hops are traditional. The finish on this was a little too grainy and starkly grassy bitter. A satisfactory Octoberfest style lager, but I think I prefer the old fashioned Märzen better.",3.75
Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"I've had only two beers from AllGauer and the first was its O-Fest. Having covered them for one season, I prefer its Festbier... in part because this only my 3rd in the style. (Indicating I'm, like, back in the 20th Century.)

This Festbier is good for malt-heads like me. Pretty in my tall weizen glass, this golden brew stays bubbly and creates a nice lace all the way down. Smells are average, almost entirely malt. (At least gimme a grassy hop.) Tastes are the same, but it never gets sweet. Balanced. Soft in my mouth, somewhat like wheat.

Fancying myself as a traditional drinker, I want to like Allgauer. But they may be too traditional even for me to warmup to. I went on their website for a second time (two years later than reviewing their O-fest) and for a second time I could not find the English button. Their product is good enough to be exported, but the language flexibility needs to be improved.",3.75
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","12 oz. can, best by date of 12/16/22. My first new beer from BrewDog in quite a while. Brewed by BrewDog in Winchester, Ohio. Acquired this can of Lord of the Rings beer as part of a mixed six pack at the local Binny's.

Poured to a La Fin Du Monde tulip.

A - Pours a pale juicy yellow-orange body, About a finger of bubbly soapy white head that dies out quick. Leaves behind a beer that is flat in appearance.

S - A nice soft aroma, more biscuity than anything I'd say. Hop content is there, but not juicy or bursting. Earthy, twiggy, leafy, skunky. Smells like fresh, but indistinct dry-hopping.

T - Taste is pretty light for the style, but right for the abv I suppose. Again, earthy leafty dry-hopping lends a bit of a skunky sort of hop flavor. Not particularly piney, resinous, or bitter. A bit of a peppery, rye malt flavor lingers near the finish.

M - Feel is smooth, crisp, clean, light-bodied, & easy drinking stuff. The 5.0% abv is nice.

Overall, an easy-drinking and inoffensive beer, but short on hop character if you ask me, especially if you're gonna call your beer a New England style IPA. Not entirely sure what this beer has got to do with Lord of the Rings, or if this beer would appeal to fans of the books / movies / series. A strange brew all around.

"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","Teaming up with the HBO producers for Lord of the Rings, Brewdog meets the occasion with a fruitier, hazier and softer IPA that's simply fellowship waiting to happen.

Pale gold, hazy and floating a stark-white foam, Fellowship IPA makes sensory introductions with a citrusy, tropical and stone fruit perfume leading to a sweeter cereal-laden taste of honeysuckle, wafer and angel food cake.

Continued sweetness stretches across the middle palate with a firm and sweet breadiness and a smooth, nearly vanilla-like spice. As the hops rise to meet the occasion, a citrusy take on tangerine and pink grapefruit provide a racy balance while a sweeter and more succulent pineapple and passionfruit character adds support and complexity. Trending lightly spicy and herbal with hops, a late taste of fresh spruce, cedar and fresh cut herbs take on a slight hemp character nearing finish.

Lighter, crisper and refreshing, the beer is off-clean and citronella-like in a medium length finish and a gin-like aftertaste. Hints of peach and hemp lead the way in retrospect to an overall impression that's not pump or rounded enough to be hazy, but still not quite crisp or bitter enough to be traditional American IPA.",3.75

Whole wheat dough leads the flavors. It is dry up front with light sweetness and faint bitterness. Lots of toasted grain gives is a similar flavor to wheat thins, although without the sweetness. The finish is light and quick. It is sharp at first, then lingers to a whisper.

Taste: This is a very drinkable beer. It has a really nice maltiness up front, and the finish is very gentle - crisp, mildly bitter, barely spicy, and dry. It has this really nice sweet, grainy flavor character that reminds me a bit of a Bavarian pretzel.

Feel: It has a nice mouthfeel - it's medium bodied but I would say full bodied for a Marzen lager. Nicely carbonated.

Overall: This is the first time I have reviewed a Jack's Abby beer. I haven't had a lot of Oktoberfest beers, but it seems to me that this is a very traditional style of Marzen especially for an American beer.

Copper Legend Octoberfest,"Servred on tap in a pint glass
Appearance – The beer is served a deep amber-orange color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam. The head fades rather fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heavy of a caramel and brown sugar smell mixed with a good showing of roast and toast. Along with these smells comes aromas of a light spice and some harvest fruit.
Taste – The taste starts with a breast and sweet taste of caramel and brown sugar. There is a good amount of roast upfront that ends up fading a bit as the taste advances. At the same time some apple and pear as well as a bit of spice develop as the taste moves forward, taking the taste to the end, and leaving a moderatly toasty and toasty, moderately sweet taste to linger on the tongue.

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a lighter, and lower alcohol version of Duvel at 6.66% ABV as opposed to the usual 8.4%. It's also quite different. Right off the bat it's poured a hazy golden body as opposed to the usually perfect clarity when properly poured. The full and fluffy bright white head is the same, and be careful when pouring or it might try to rise up out of the glass! The head is made up of many very small bubbles giving it an airy and pillowy appearance.
It looks like a warm marshmallow that's just about to melt. The head retention and lacing are both quite good (I've already sampled three out of the four I bought). The aroma is bright with flowers, soft fruit (apples, orange, hint of lemon, background banana), candy sugar, sweet malt, delicate crushed black peppercorn, and a touch of spice. The flavor follows, and it's surprisingly rich. It's sweet and sugary but also floral, peppery, gently spicy, malty and subtly woody and earthy. A firm bitterness breaks through mid-palate and it starts to dry, eventually finishing with some earthiness and lightly spicy hop flavors. It lingers with some residual malt, crushed black peppercorn, earthiness, and those delicately spicy hop notes. It's impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst sweet and sugary malt character. This isn't necessarily more hoppy than the original Duvel but the additional citrusy and floral character gives it a greater depth of character. Missing is the very well hidden snap of alcohol of the original Devil but the hops make up for it. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue that can sometimes be a little bit more bristling although it always softens to become quite smooth and airy. This version has less bite than the original, and yet I'm not really sure that it's really that much more drinkable - hence the original name, Duvel! It is remarkably enjoyable, however, and even more drinakble in terms of alcohol.
Review #8,193",4.25
"Duvel 6,66%","special version of this, a little lower alcohol but quite a bit more character than the single version, its hoppy in a delicate but distinctive way, has a beautiful ferment on it, and is still similar to the original from a yeast standpoint, really high quality and gorgeously refined belgian blonde here, shocked it does not have higher ratings, what more do people want from this style? golden straw colored and not quite clear from the little stubby bottle, high rising white head with great retention and undeniable effervescence. it smells rather complex, but also extremely cohesive, noble hop spiciness through a good portion of it, unique yeast esters from ripe banana to lemongrass, black and green peppercorn, and even rubbed sage or something truly herbal. there is a lightness and a brightness to this, a simple belgian pils type malt base, and really excited carbonation, seems super dialed in to me. the flavor is great, yeast forward, classically belgian, light pear and gum esters, cool spiciness super compatible with the hops, clean citrus, but the flavor is tied up intimately with the texture, and this fizzes and pops like no other before a rapid dry finish, its so refreshing and vibrant, tidy for a belgian without a long linger, and the higher hop content bringing some late bitterness to help snap it up further. lightly floral late, warms up peachy and clovey, but to me stays delicate and easy, very jovial and springy, and the hops do a lot for this. overall super impressive beer, again i am surprised to see it scored this low here on BA, its a winner. neat to see some innovation from duvel! i could drink a dozen of these.",4.25
"Duvel 6,66%","Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Looks a lot like classic Duvel, including the massive head, with a couple of differences. The color is a bit lighter here compared to the classic, and the head is slightly less dense, but still stays around for a while.

Smell is classic Belgian, malty and yeasty up front, with a healthy mix of fruit, I am picking up mainly apple and pear and a hint of lemon.

Was not near as hop heavy as expected. Fruit really dominates for me, mainly pear and apple. There is a decent amount of peppery heat at the finish, leaving me with a slight burning sensation. Actually a pretty nice blending of flavors.

Feels nice and solid to me, quite a bit of carbonation. Really makes my tongue tingle.

A different but very nice variation on a classic. My main complaint with classic Duvel is it leans a bit heavy on the hops, this version feels more like some classic Belgian ales. This one really screams summer beer to me, drinking it on a 90 degree day, and really hits the spot. Highly recommended, really can't go wrong with it.",4.25
"Duvel 6,66%","Poured from 330mL bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. Best by 8/2023.

Appearance: nice medium-golden hue with a moderate haze and a huge, pretty, and inconvenient head of about 3 thick fingers of frothy ivory foam. Lovely!

Smell: light, sweet malt, with a lovely apple-pear orchard-like aroma, topped with a light but notable dose of noble hops. Again -- lovely!

Taste: sweetly malty, with a share of that lovely pear character from the aroma. There's something here, whether it's the light booziness or the clash of the hops and the peary malt character, that makes it not quite as good as its aroma. Still, it's delicious -- just not quite as delicious as I want it to be.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a big carbonation and a good creaminess.

Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of spicy Belgian yeast (white pepper + coriander) over the top of moderate aromas of pale + wheat malts with a light to moderate amount of light fruit (pear + white grape) sweetness. Light aromas of floral + herbal + grassy + citrus/lemon hops.

This will be a better table ale than I expected, particularly for summer fare. Glad I bought a 4-pack.... and may want another.
Duvel is also my most favored brand manager among crafters. Duvel lets its brands loose to create... but it does that because Duvel knows itself how freedom, properly directed, can create.

"Duvel 6,66%","The beer of the devil is now available on the shelves for us all to enjoy. Spicier, drier and fruitier, this beer makes one hell of a debut.

Light chrome, racing with carbonated streams and building a fluffy white crown, Duvel 6.66 teases the nose with a sharp and spicy scent of citrus zest, dried fruit, vinous spice, grassy and botanical perfumes. A low lying sweetness grazes the early palate with the lightness of wafer crackers, light bread and a hint of fresh dough.

As the flavors unfold on the middle palate, the malts retreat and the fruits begin to shine. Pear, apple and lemon all seem branch-dried in nature while the more spicy flavors of orange, lemon, grapefruit and lime zest play out partly fruity but partly spice. Those spices lean into the briskness of coriander, white pepper and vinous tanginess precisely. A late taste of bitterness is herbal, pleasantly grassy and herbal with lemon balm and sassafras.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the beer is plagued slightly bite the fruit tannins that amplify the hop bitterness and give the beer a decidedly bitter balance in finish and aftertaste. A quick fleeting malt presence leaves behind a long and spicy aftertaste.",4.0

Torpedo Extra IPA is an aggressive yet balanced beer with massive hop aromas of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit.

Overall - An interesting brew that is not for the faint of heart. This one is meant for those who like whiskey forward brews. They definitely did a good job on that. The ABV is pretty hidden in this one making it a dangerous sipper. A pleasant tipple on this fall-ish evening here in Cowtown.",4.25

Dead 'N' Dead,"Tallboy can from the LCBO; dated Jul 28 2021 and served barely chilled. Always nice to see a new Rogue beer, as their presence around here has been spotty in the recent past.

Pours a foggy orange-amber colour, crowned with nearly an inch of smooth, creamy, off white-tinged head that gradually seeps off. Within five minutes, it has been reduced to a thick, creamy collar and filmy cap, with a gorgeous curtain of lace left clinging to the glass - a beautiful glass of beer. Plenty of bready malt and toasted grains on the nose, with vanilla and toffee also coming through pretty clearly; also some subtler hints of oak, plum, apple and booze.

It's a fine strong ale, boasting a firm oak-iness on the back end. It starts off with bready malts, toasted grains and toffee sweetness, with hints of whiskey and vanilla developing quickly. Suggestions of herbal hops, spiced & stewed plums, apple and a touch of raisin are quickly overtaken by oak chip/'wood tannins', which linger through the finish and into a moderately warming aftertaste of whiskey and malts. Medium-full in body, with middling carbonation that gives a gentle bite to this bock's smooth, satisfying texture. Fair drinkability - I was getting a little tired of the oak chips by the end of the glass, but finishing the can was no challenge at all.

Final Grade: 4.04, an A-. Much like its older, lighter brother, Dead 'N' Dead bears only a passing resemblance to the style Rogue has chosen to market it as - though I suppose in this case, the whiskey/oak chip treatments made that practically inevitable. If taken strictly as a German maibock (I'm not), there is ample opportunity for criticism - but as a strong oaked beer, I think it's quite enjoyable. In truth, I'd probably take regular Dead Guy over this... but then again, I've never been gung-ho about either oak or whiskey, so folks who happen to be really big on strong oaked ales might enjoy it even more than I did. Either way, give it a try it you have the chance.",4.25

Sweet malty aroma of caramel apple, faintly of warm spice and vanilla, dash of maple syrup; pretty mild.

Dead 'N' Dead,"2018 vintage

Being a massive fan of OG Dead Guy, I knew I had to get this when I saw it. Hopefully this expands upon what I love about the original

Pours a turbid, hazy copper with just a cap of off white head that fades quickly to a ring and leaves no lacing

The nose is quite sweet, but almost artificially so. I get layers of vanilla, honey, and caramel with very mild pepper to back it up. The barrel doesn’t really do much aroma wise other than contributing the vanilla notes

The taste is more of the same, yet not as exciting. To start things off, I get caramel and a light whiskey tingle. On the aftertaste, this translates to a decent oaky sweet bourbon with hints of honey and a touch of chocolate

This has a medium body and almost no carbonation, yet it still drinks pretty light, especially for the abv. This is probably the biggest saving grace of this one

Well shit, here’s an instance where the base beer is better thab the barrel aged version!! It could be a freshness issue, as I noticed this was pretty much a malt bomb when compared to the delicate balance of the original.

King Julius,"With utmost radiance, vibrancy and brilliance in its hop display, Tree House's Imperial New England IPA hits hops pinnacle. In a world of princes, they are the king.

And the excellence in King Julius is not only expected but also realized with a creamy peachy-taupe and golden hue with airy textures in its creamy meringue-like froth. The beer's muddled appearance only works to make the session more appetizing. A slow separation of froth ale underneath suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy-sweet and fruit-filled taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and sprucy scent starts out like a fruitier citronella.

The flavors that simply blossom on the middle palate are abundant with a bursting fruit display. Branch-ripe tangerine,in all its tangy, fructose-sweet and vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple, pawpaw and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting finish, a sense of herbal sherbet with citronella apply their final and lasting impressions of spiked fruit punch.

Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts plush on the palate but trails into a semi-dry, smoothly bittered, softly resinous and tea-like finish. The soft sappiness of fresh and perfumy cedar links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative minty cooling and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with gin-spiked sorbet textures as well as flavors.",4.75
King Julius,"16oz. Can served in a Spiegelau tulip. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a frothy, half-inch, off-white head. Nose expresses bright notes of Mandarin Orange and peel.

King Julius,"Canned 8/19/22. Warm yellow orange color, totally opaque hazy beer. An inch of just off-white head on top which hangs around a good bit, and laces the glass well. Nose is as advertised, orange cream, mango, honeydew melon, ripe and sweet and a bit floral at the end. There are so many good NEIPAs out there that I often think they start to run together... then I taste something like this. Sweet at the very beginning, but also floral, big citrus notes, grapefruit and orange peel, with a silky feel. What's incredible is how clean it finishes for what really starts out pretty sweet, but the grassy and a little bitter orange hop resin at the end leave your mouth not overly sweet at the end. The booze is present, but it plays in the background. The bitterness shines through especially at the end in a really satisfying ""take another sip"" type of way.",4.75

""The Crimson King's balcony beer"", indeed.

Wow. It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation. Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian white-collar prison in heaven. That or an Orange Julius from hell. Either way, only the best.

Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy. It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything off-putting in the flavor. Lovely look to it. Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine, clementine, apricots, grapefruit rind dipped in honey, pithy citrus oil, weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel, I could go on. Again, wow....

Like with most of the IIPAs from TH, this is as close to perfect as you can get. A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique, each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others. Textbook example of what the style can be.

One other thing I want to add here for no real reason. I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years. These are the first of their beers I've had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible (at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec). A month old and just mellowed right into itself. No vague hints of oxidation, no fading or changing profile over the few cans I've had of this (and others ranging up to a month and a half old). Anyway, cheers to the canning line. Based on their many date code messages I've seen over the years and including this one I think we'd all enjoy sitting around listening to music together. You guys rock!

Cheers, KC!

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

S: The aroma contains strong floral and dank hops, strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits and light caramelized malts.

T: The taste starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.

M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.

Appearance – The beer pours a clear orange amber color with a small head of fizzy white foam. The head has a light level of retention, fading to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

Taste – The taste begins with a caramel and harvest fruit sweetness (apple, pear) along with a medium light toasted bready malt body. As the taste advances these flavors persist, while some light herbal and earthy tastes join in. The mix of flavors takes the taste to the end and leave one with a sweeter lightly toasted taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is average in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. For the sweeter malt flavors of the brew the feel is good and makes for a nice easy sipper.

Taste: bready, a bit toasty, and a bit biscuity. There's a light but balanced bitterness; the overall effect seems very autumnal to me (as one might expect). I'm not usually a fan of the biscuity character in malt, but here it adds an appropriate dimension to a beer of this style.

Aroma: There are notes of cherry and a light oak character mixed with crushed acorn and walnut.

Taste: Cherry comes through with a light bit of caramel up front. In the middle there is a light roasted nut character with a hint of toasted bread. The back of the mouth has more of the same nuttiness that the middle does. Aftertaste has a light caramel sweetness.

Mouthfeel: It feels medium-light on the palate and watery. Very light toasted bitterness. It doesn't cling well to the palate or have much of an impact on it. It has a light bit of slickness which feels off for the style.

Overall: It feels like the average attempt at an Oktoberfestbier but it lacks texture, complexity, cohesiveness, and it doesn't look the greatest in a glass. It's drinkable and I probably wouldn't turn one down for free but it isn't something I'd likely buy again or recommend.",3.0

Grabbed a can of this, a bunch of other stuff and a 6-pack of something else on a recent trip to Trader Joe’s. AleSmith does almost everything well (except hoppy beers to me, but everything else), so I was looking to try this. Was actually surprised that I hadn’t reviewed this before, let alone checked into it on Beer Advocate. Back of the can read, “This German-style Marzen Lager is our take on a classic Oktoberfest offering. AleSchmidt Oktoberfest is characterized by a clean, elegant, and toasty malt character. Prost!”

Poured a dark amber clear color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki white rocky-to-frothy head, which dissipated quickly. Lots of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Bad watery, spotty lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.25)

Smelled Outback bread, honey, wheat, sweet grain, mixed nuts, toasted malts, chewy caramel, toasted biscuit and graham cracker. Not quite as good from the can but got some earthier malts with some leathery toffee notes. (Smell - 4.00)

Tasted a little better than the nose but followed for the most part. A very clean beer. Got Outback bread, honey, wheat, sweet grain, toasted malts, chewy caramel, mixed nuts, Wheat Thins, toasted biscuit, leathery toffee, hints of tobacco and graham cracker. (Taste - 4.25)

Nose is slightly malt forward for the color yet not so much as for most American versions of the style. I think festbier is quite different than Marzen in style. This one is squarely in the middle.

On the pour nearly 4 fingers of fine white head formed that peeks out over top of the glass. Body is lightly hazy woth some hop sediment and is an orange brass hue. Some lacing is left.

Aroma is quite tropical and fruity woth a bit of darkness on the back. Quite a bit of citrus on this one and maybe even some guava. Like a better voodoo ranger, but not game changing.

Taste follows the aroma, and stays quite clean and fruity, but there is a definite sweetness and alcohol that gives away the abv. The hop bitterness creeps in as the sweetness fades, making this relatively balanced although the sweet and bitter don't happen at the same time.

Feel is big but still refreshingly hoppy and bright. The finish is long and quite full bodied, and as the sweetness fades it almost feels like it slowly coats your tongue. This one's pretty fun to drink but there are some heavy feelings that make me knock a few points.

T - Big chocolate roast with some char, Bourbon, vanilla, and oak. There's a big lingering oak/Bourbon presence after the sip with a little bit of chocolate char in the mix. (There's a tad bit of cherry poking through as well.)

M - Medium body with a little bit of thinness around the edges and some alcohol warming in the back of the throat on the first few sips.

O - Needs a little more chocolate roast and less Bourbon presence.",4.0
Imperialis,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter
Appearance – The beer ours a deep brown, nearly black color with a one finger head of brown foam. The thickness of the brew can be seen when swirling the beer in the glass. Thick sticky fingers of beer cling to the sides of the glass upon swirling, with the slowly receding to the bottom of the snifter. The head that was present upon pouring fades rather fast, leaving a light level of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is massive of a rich roasted and toasted malt smell that is accompanied by tons of chocolate and sweet caramel and molasses. Along with these aromas comes a nice bourbon and woody smell that has notes of leather and smoke mixed within. Other sweeter smells of prune and plum as well as a good showing of vanilla.
Taste – The taste starts out with a semi sweet cocoa and heavily roasted and toasted malt flavor. The sweet upfront is mainly of the brown sugar and molasses nature but has a little bit of a dark fruit flavor of raisin and prune. There is a nice presence of a smooth vanilla flavor as well, that compliments the sweet rather nicely. Right from the start, the bourbon and oak can be appreciated as well, both of which get stronger as the taste advances forward on the tongue. Along with the bourbon getting stronger, so too comes a bit of bitter coffee and some char flavors. At the end the bourbon, oak, and char surge and are accompanied by a bit of leather, leaving one with a nice rich, not too sweet, but nice and warming taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is low. For the mix of dark, roast, booze, and sweet the feel is great and makes for one nice pleasant sipper.
Overall – A rather nice bourbon barrel aged stout. Rather balanced, as it is not too heavy in any one of its flavor attributes. Overall, very nice.",4.25
Imperialis,"Its quite odd to see a barrel-aged series beer from Avery to be so light, ordinary and normal. Simply an Imperial Stout aged for only six months in those barrels, this mere 12.7% stout shows quite the restraint.

Very dark brown and flirting with blackness, Imperialis kicks off with a light tan skirt of froth. With a roasty, toasty, spicy and cola-like scent, the beer's aromatics hinge on chocolate, booze soaked oak, dark fruit, vanilla and caramel. Similarly in taste, its early impressions are robust and sweet with caramel, vanilla, toasted coconut, chocolate and dry molasses.

The spices quickly take over the sweetness as the dark ale embarks upon the middle palate. Malt dominance dries to a coffee, cocoa and cola nut character for a taste that backs off of the heavy and robust char of espresso or campfire. Moderately bitter in a late and woodsy impression, the oak tannins and booze flavors leave a late taste of vanilla, cola, roasted red grape and lacquer on the tongue.

Full bodied but not as heavy as those that we have become accustomed, there's a relaxed sense of drinkability that comes with the slightly lackluster stout. Finishing nutty, spicy and with a long Kona-like coffee flavor, the ale is basically a beer's version of affogato in a glass.",4.0

Imperialis,"Not my favorite Avery stout, but a good bargain and about what I expected for the price. The nearly black color and brown foam is quite enticing. The taste is mostly oaken bourbon and vanilla and cherry, with roasted malts and char, ethanol, slight sweetness, and a hint of chocolate. Its a bit boozy and has some rough edges. Addition of something like cherries or chocolate would probably take this over the top, but as is it is quite nice and grows on you as you drink it.",4.0
Imperialis,"Deep, dark brown body, opaque; thick and densely spongy head, light khaki color; thick, sticky sheets of foam curtain the glass. Rich, dark chocolate and cocoa aroma; very light char note. Rich dark malt flavor; baker's and milk chocolate plus cocoa; bold whiskey presence; low bitterness; moderate alcohol phenol presence; very light oak note. Heavy mouthfeel yet soft and velvety on the palate; huge boozy heat offsets the residual sugars.

This is a very likeable barrel aged imperial stout. The base beer is righteous while the bourbon barrel character cuts through like a healthy neat shot of your favorite straight whiskey. Maybe a little hot on the palate, but I'm thinking some judicious bottle aging will mellow this one out for the better.

Imperialis,"Poured at fridge temp into my SBG glass, it's a cola-esque light/deep brown and settles into dark black..like every good stout.

Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"Brown in color with a murky complexion. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering a quarter of the top.

Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"Bottled 7/7/21, enjoyed 9/13/22 - Although it has a fairly high ABV, not sure this is meant to be cellared. So consider the aging if you read this.
Poured copper, bright reddish copper with very active carbonation but little head and no lacing.
Aroma was almost lost on my damaged nose completely, very mild. A bit of malts gets through and an indiscernible sweetness rather after the sniff. Hmmm.
The taste was very good actually, the sweetness found its way to the front, a bit of vanilla, touch of cherries and a hint of orange. All wrapped up in bourbon. At least to start with, after a few minutes it settles down and the rest of the flavors are back. I think I need to get a new one and try it fresh.
The feel was rather viscous, but well suited for a BA bourbon based malt beverage (okay, beer)
Tasty, quite tasty.",4.0
Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"Poured a seethru copper body with minimal head. Aroma is mild with notes of caramel, toffee and biscuit.

Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"Day was when I would hunt down any Founders barrel aged release, but those days are years gone. Experimental sounding 12 oz. bottle up & split with the wife.

The pour is more copper than copper, with about as much life. The nose is vaguely sweet & unremarkable.

Highball Drifter is surprisingly tame. Delicate oranges shake hands with gentle bitters & a low level of bourbon. Sweetness winds throughout with a touch of vanilla on the finish. Alcohol sneaks up on one. Glad I split this itty bitty bottle.

This is a beer that tastes like it was brewed not to offend. Anyone. Ever. Decent enough.",3.0
Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"Highball Drifter from Founders. Purchased from Franklin Beer Company, Franklin, PA, 12/08/22 for $ 14.50(Including tax)/four-pack of 12 oz bottles ($ 0.30/oz). On room-temperature shelf at store and stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 26/08/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped “BOTTLED ON 06.09.22” on the rear label. Served at 51.9 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 58.8 degrees.
Appearance – 3.
First pour – Medium Amber (SRM 12), CLEAR.
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear-lite, ruby and clear.
Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density, short retention, receding to a 0.5 to 2.5 mm ring of tiny bubbles constantly being renewed by effervescence (No crown per se) and a small island for a cap.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 3.25 – Not much, just a weak fruitiness. No malt, no hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Begins slightly sweet and generally citrus fruity, no malt, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. No distinct cherry or orange; instead, a mulled yet flavorful blend. Bourbon is not distinct but ties all the flavors together. Moderate lower gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 3.5 – Medium, slightly thicker than water, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 This far, this is probably my favorite from the Bottle Shop series, although I’ve never had a highball. The flavor is well-blended and tasty, with enough linalool (and hidden ethanol) to sedate. I’m headed to my local distributor later to pick up a case!",4.5

Notes of orange, cherry, caramel, yeasty malts, ethanol, raisin, plumb, vanilla, oak, with slight hints of cola, nutmeg, coriander, tobacco.

Smell: malty and quite sweet with a hop aroma that to me is noble, grassy, and earthy. Kind of on the subtle side for the style.

Taste: sweet malt and a big dose of piney, earthy, herbal, grassy hops, along with a bitterness that, while somewhat strong, is not quite enough to compete with the sweetness.

Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a good level of carbonation and creaminess.

Atomic Torpedo,"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep amber coloration with a large, fluffy head. Smells of doughy, caramel malt and resinous, citrus hops, with notes of grapefruit and pine, as well as hints of floral and woody accents.

Finishes with a medium bitterness and some grapefruit, pine and nutmeg lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

While this may lack the punch and expressive character one might expect of a Double Ipa, it's quite easy drinking for the ABV without a hint of booze to it, while featuring quite an intriguing array of hop characteristics, ranging from fruity and floral over bitter and resinous to more subtle spicy and woody. While it's dominated by that typical West Coast character of citrus and resinous pine, there's a good, East Coast, caramel malt backbone to this as well, while those other accents make for a very interesting drinking experience here.",4.25
Liquid Hot Magma,"16oz can poured into a becher.

A: Deep golden color, almost approaching amber. uniform haze is barely opaque. Billowy white head retains extremely well. Very chunky lacing.

S: Bursting with passionfruit and mandarin orange, pineapple, guava, peach. Meyer lemon. Faint whiffs of green grass clippings. Simple grain base is doughy with a slight toasty grain character. It is so pronounced and tropical, it isn't even funny. This is one of the most memorable noses I've sniffed all year in the IPA world, and that says a LOT.

T: Orange juice, pineapple, hints of mango and peach. Squeeze of meyer lemon and some pithiness. Tart passion fruit for an instant. There's an almost creamy pina colada impression too. Some green oiliness and perhaps the faintest hint of sweet onion buried far in the background. Quick brush of alcohol. Doughy grain base, slight toastiness. Bitterness is fairly minimal. Peaches and cream sort of finish with some green-ness.

M: Medium-full body. Even creamy and full/fluffy feel from stem to stern. Cloud-like. Well carbonated and airy, without being sharp. There's plenty of lift, but the easy and creamy texture is never broke. Very slight hop tannin grip.

O: In a sea of hazy IPAs, this is a true standout. Get it in a blind tasting with all the hype-bombs and watch it mop the floor with the field. It's so well-focused, with a simple and straightforward grain bill that adds awesome texture and backbone, and the hopping is truly unique. Ridiculously fresh and tropical to the point you could swear it was made with actual fruit. There's no hop burn, no muddiness, and it drinks so easily and sits lightly in the stomach. This is hazy IPA at its absolute pinnacle.",4.75
Liquid Hot Magma,The first crushable NEDIPA!!! Experimental hops do the magic. Great brew; Chapeau,5.0
Liquid Hot Magma,"Here's another one. A pseudo IPA likely without much of an essential ingredient, barley malt. How can you tell? First, it's the big foamy mess on top of the liquid contents emptied from a pint can into a clear glass liter mug. The ridiculous mess recedes quickly, unevenly, unattractively and with slight lacing. Usually, this also means a brew lacking body and complexity, but we shall taste. The aroma is weak, with just a little wet hoppiness present. It rises above a dirty amber colored beer. To drink, the body is way too light for something in this category. But, there is enough depth to the sweet background to compliment a nice hop presence that seems more earthy than the self described fruit references. The ABV is included only as a positive taste inclusion.This is one more example of a not so bad IPA that would only be improved with more barley malt.",4.25
Liquid Hot Magma,"Man, I love Zero Gravity, one of the best New England breweries and one that delivers consistently tasty IPAs, pale ales, and lagers at a lower than usual price. I have the mix pack in my fridge right now. This new one pours almost a glowing orange, hazy but not thick. Smells a bit earthy and slightly fruity. Taste is pungent hops, bringing some sharp oniony grass but also some citrus fruit as well. Easy to drink for 8%.",4.25

Oktoberfest,"Not sure if I expected more or the last Märzen beer I had (Spaten) altered my taste a bit.
Poured very nice looking golden amber but the head was nearly mia. Odd for an Oktoberfest beer.
The aroma was good, bready malts, a touch of sweetness, maybe caramel, and no discernible hops.
The taste followed, very pleasant bready malts that’s slightly sweet in an indiscernible way. Pretty traditional Märzen style, and good.
The feel was subdued just a bit, maybe the lack of head was an indication of loss of carbonation. But it was still really quaffable.

Best By: 17 Nov, 2021
Consumed on: 24 May, 2022
Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: 51.2 F


Look:
Deep and bright golden-hued copper that becomes dark gold when held to a light. 2-finger off-white creamy head slowly dissolves to a very thin but consistent cover. Lacing along the glass is excellent.

Smell:
The nose is somewhat restrained. Lightly toasted grains and sweet bready malts. Biscuity. There is a very, very slight note of grass.

Taste:
Early notes of toasted caramel and bread dough give way to a noticeable but not overpowering hop bite and a moderate earthy bitterness. There is a nice balance. As the beer warms slightly, some vinous notes appear. Things finish dry, with the alcohol making an appearance at the very end and in the aftertaste.

Feel:
Crisp and dry. Body is medium, with a lean to the light side.

Overall:
This is not completely on-style for an Oktoberfest/Marzen, but it is a fine beer nonetheless. I view this beer as more of a Heller/Amber Bock (perhaps even a Maibock) and in that respect it is quite good. A good beer for a cool fall day or spring night. YMMV.",3.75
Oktoberfest,"12 oz bottle, best by 11/17/21.
Samuel Adams Ugly Sweater Run Pint Glass.

Burnt sienna/orange color with a half finger of head that runs out the back door with its hair on fire. No head left after 10 seconds.

Aroma of moldy grain and wet leaves, with hints of caramel, pumpkin, and faint citrus.

This beer is pretty full-flavored. Hoppy but not too hoppy, malty but not too malty. It opens with smoked caramel notes and hints of pumpernickel bread. Halfway through, the hop bite comes in and brings a robust medicinal bitterness a la Ricola but it's not gross and fits in nicely. It finishes on orange peel, smoked apricot, and spicy notes. The 6.5% is already hitting me.

Feel is crisp, moderately oily, semi-smooth, and brings a wave of alcohol heat on the back end.

Overall, this could be marketed as an imperial Oktoberfest, as it's quite the pumper. This is a very tasty beer and an excellent example of the style. I would absolutely buy this again if I were in the mood for an Oktoberfest. This would go really good with spicy mustard and doughy pretzels. Wow.

$1.66 / Binny's",4.25
Oktoberfest,"Frankly surprised by this beer being listed as Outstanding. It's a marginal marzen. It looks the part--amber, off-white foamy head.

Oktoberfest,"2022 Review:

Appearance: Pours a beautiful, deep, but bright amber color with a small off white head. SRM of 13. (4.25)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread and caramel. Not anything impressive, but definitely picks up as it warms. (3.75+)

Flavor: Strong and bready flavors of bread, rich amber malt, caramel. Lots of toasted notes mix with the bread malt and caramel. Some floral notes and also some red notes as listed below. Rich bread malts, earthy, red, yet flavorful and sweet. (4.25)

Compared to 3 Sheeps Oktoberfest 9/5/22: Pours lighter, Milder aromas. Less toasted caramel and bread, earthy Munihc malt. More smooth bread and pale malts. Lighter and more pale.

Compared to 3 Floyd's Munsterfest 9/14/22: Pours slightly darker, milder aromas. More earthy, sweet honey. Less

Compared to Revolution Oktoberfest 9/14/22: Pours slightly darker, stronger aromas. More earthy, sweet honey. Slightly more spice. Less floral and toasty though. Slightly sweeter. Overall, very similar.

Feel: Heavier-bodied. Sweeter, yeast well-carbonated, rounded, and smooth. Balanced. (4.25)

2021 Review:
Appearance: Pours a beautiful, deep, but bright amber color with a small off white head. SRM of 13. (4.25)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread, grass, and earthy Munich malt with some flower and possibly caramel and bread spice. Hints of cherry and citrus hops too. (4.00)

Flavor: Bready and rich. A definite nice hint of earthy German flower and farm. Finishes very bready and with rich caramel. There is a rye, cherry and red apple hop flavor here too. Tastes like rich baking bread on a German farm on a rainy day. (4.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Well carbonated. Extremely balanced, and finishes clean and slightly sweet on the palate. (4.25)

Compared to Surly Oktoberfest: It's pours a darker amber with an off-white head. More bready and caramel malt flavors. Less spice and rye. Finishes smoother and sweeter. Less bitter.

Compared to Central Waters' Oktoberfest 9/5/20: Pours a lighter color with a lighter head. More dry bread and grass. Less dark bread, caramel, vanilla. Less sweet overall. Leans much more traditional festbier than American Marzen.

Compared to Founders Oktoberfest 9/20/20: Pours a similar color. Similar mild aromas. More red apple, cherry, and spiciness/tartness on the flavor. Less bready. More roasty, Americanizized and less roasty. More traditional.
10/31/20: Pours an identical color. More flower, citrus, cherry on the aroma/flavor. Less smooth caramel and honey. More red fruit and bitterness. Also more toasty. Nearly identical. (see below for 2021 comparison)

Compared to Odell's Oktoberfest 9/22/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. More bready aromas. Less spiced caramel and cherry liquor. Smoother, less spice and bite. Winner: Great Lakes.

Compared to Breckenridge Oktoberfest 9/27/20: Pours a slightly lighter color, but with a stronger head. More caramel, cherry, and alcohol aromas. Less grass, honey, and citrus. Sweeter, and more full overall.

Compared to Left Hand Oktoberfest 11/25/20: Pours a slightly lighter color with a similar head. More earthy honey and fruity. Less

Compared to Bells Oktoberfest 9/24/21: Pours a darker color. More cloying cherry hops and rich caramel. Less toasty and balanced.

Compared to Founders Oktoberfest 10/8/21: Pours a slightly lighter color. More citrus and spice. Less sweet caramel malts and phenolic flavors. A more balanced Oktoberfest overall. Winner: Great Lakes

Compared to Sam Adams Oktoberfest 12/30/21: Pours a lighter color. Hoppier aromas. More German noble hops and bread notes. Less rich caramel, cherry, and spice. More hoppy, bready, and Oktoberfest-like.

Overall: A very balanced, full, and American Marzen style. At first it drinks pretty standard and rounded. Nice flavors with some hints of flower and cherry spice. Wait until it warms. Caramel and slight chocolate malt shine as the beer warms. Exactly what I'm looking for in an Oktoberfest Marzen. Not overpowering but captures the right flavors. It's still slightly heavier bodied and stronger than a traditional festbier, but one of the best American versions of the style. This one is good, and It's bread spice in a glass. Strong, yet balanced and appropriate. Fantastic stuff here. (Final Rating: 4.23)

Oktoberfest,"Pours a clear amber from the bottle, brief head, no retention. Nose is brown bread, light baking spice, sweet malts - classic profile.

Oktoberfest,"Poured into a pint glass, a light, loosely carbonated two finger head forms, but begins to subside immediately. The color of this beer is beautiful.. it's golden amber inherently looks like autumn leaves.. apropo for an Oktoberfest beer! The nose is restrained, but good.. sweet grains with mild hops and malt notes. Adequate lacing does survive for 20 minutes. The taste of this Great Lakes brew, to me, is the styiistic definition of Octoberfest -Maarzen style. I have tried many other Octoberfests, first with Sam Adams, 30 years ago. This one gets everything right.. It is sweet, hops-malt balanced, with an earthy grain taste and fine mouth feel. More importantly, it does not bear the excesses of so many competitors.. no excessive hops skunkiness, no dryness, no lingering dirt aftertaste! It is a beautifully crafted, fully realized example of what an Octoberfest-Marzen should be! I'm sure I will continue to try other Octoberfests, but I expect to keep coming back to my fave by Great Lakes, every year!",4.25
Oktoberfest,"Dark in color and aroma, with a dark amber hue and no head and consistent toasted caramel note in the nose.

A little late hopping and a crisp, medium finish improve the final product as well.",4.0
Oktoberfest,"Outstanding Oktoberfest bier! It is a Marzen style with a dark amber color. Pours with a light head. It has a slightly roasted malt flavor which distinguishes it from other Oktoberfest beers. Perfectly balanced. Very easy drinking, as it should be!",4.75
Oktoberfest,"Disclaimer: I am using Oktoberfest to refer to any of the many styles brewed for Oktoberfest. I understand that Oktoberfest is not a style in and of itself.

Let me start this by start this by saying that, despite enjoying many Bavarian beers (and if I’m not a glutton for Bavarian food, I don’t know who is), I’m not sure that Oktoberfest-style beers have ever been my thing. I can drink dunkels for hours. -But give me 3 Oktoberfests instead? And I’ll probably drink no more than 2, and likely one 1. It’s not that I dislike them (as a group), just sometimes the Marzen’s are too pale, and in general they don’t seem to tickle me the way that something like a Dunkel would. That said, combine them with certain food styles, and they dramatically improve the drinking experience (for me, anyway).

Tonight is a new beer to me.

Great Lakes - Oktoberfest

6.5 %ABV, 20 IBUs

The beer is listed as a “Marzen style lager” on the can and on BA.

No canned on Date, but the can lists 10/25/2021, which I assume is a BBD, which I assume is a 90-day from Canned date, not a 45-day date, making this canned on 7/25/2021, putting this just shy of 2 months from canning. Picked up at a Kroger as part of a mix-6 pack of just Oktoberfests for this tasting. (Unfortunately I drank 4 before the tasting ever started, so…)

The beer was removed from a 45ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 weeks. Beer poured into a classic Haufbrauhaus dimpled mug.

First Impression: Beer pours light in color – much closer to the straw-like yellows of a Pilsner than the golden-amber I normally expect from other Oktoberfests. No immediate aromatics.

Appearance: Pretty enough, but nothing special, although a little surprised at its’ light color. An appropriate amount of head for the style when first poured, which dissipated to nothing (with no lacing) almost immediately. Not swearing I am rating appearance correctly here, as appearance always feels quite subjective. 3.5

Smell: This beer is not extremely aromatic. My first test for any Oktoberfest beer is does it give me that quintisential “beer smell” and “beer taste”. What do I mean? It tastes like bier, bruh. I know this isn’t descriptive, but in my mind this is always what I think beer tastes and smells like. I’m tried to smell and describe this for 5-7 minutes now, and nothing is coming to me. It’s just non-descript except as “bier”. Think I say this every year. 4.0

Taste: A distinctively ‘bier’ taste that is not a pale as I might have expected for being called a marzen. Interestingly, this doesn’t strike me as being true to style, although I am no expert. I get some hints of banana and clove that I typically only find in dubbels, tripels, and quads. Maybe even a little bit of bubbelgum. It’s not on the front end, but the back, but also not much really left in the aftertaste. It’s right at the moment you swallow. (That’s what she said.) 3.75

Mouthfeel: Nothing unique or special. It feels (get it) true to style. If anything, it’s almost slightly too viscous for a marzen, as it is encroaching on dubbel territory. 4.25

Overall: This is fine. I’m not sure I like it that much, but I do appreciate that it’s a good beer. I also understand, truly, why so many people like it, and why there are so many fans here on BA. That said, again, I don’t think it’s really right for me. I won’t be buying a 6-pack or multiples each year, but I very well may buy a single most years. 4.25

BA Review Score: 3.95
In retrospect, I think a score of 3.95 is pretty fair. I think it’s close to or right around a solid B. I’d be hard pressed to give it any higher than a B unless I am comparing it to other beers. Of the 5 total Oktoberfests I have had this year so far, this isn’t the worst, but it’s also not my favorite. I’d probably say it’s right in the middle. This beer did make me go fry up a Knockwurst and a Bier bratwurst, though. Spicy bratwurst mustard ready.",4.25
Hater Blockers,"Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 6/27/22 into a snifter.

Look- Pale gold, very hazy, opaque, fine white head, below average head retention, average lacing.

Smell- Clementine, ripe melon, pineapple.

Taste- Clementine, ripe melon, grapefruit, moderately astringent.

Feel- Medium body, substantially below average carbonation, mild bitterness, moderately creamy, moderately astringent.

Overall- Very pleasant bouquet and flavors. Astringency was a major detractor, but the ripe melon flavors did offset some of the astringency.",4.0
Hater Blockers,"I am trying this beer off the tapper at The Daily Growler in Powell, Ohio as part of a six sample flight. It poured a hazy yellow with white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had fresh tangerine and orange notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with fruit peel spice of apricot, guava, and stone fruit. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.",4.25
Hater Blockers,"Appearance: Pours a nearly completely hazy (10% clarity) medium to light orange color with a mild white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Strong aromas of candied pineapple and mango upfront. Some over-ripe orange and cantaloupe melon. An almost pain-like sweet candied pineapple and mango.

Flavor: Strong and candied flavors of lemon, candied pineapple, sweet mango. Some lightly astringency citrus and pineapple notes, almost a burn. The finish is sweet with some hopburn.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Leaves a hop burn and sweetness on the palate.

Compared to Equilibrium Mast Theory 8/6/22: Pours a lighter color, milder head. More sweet candied pineapple, orange, and paint. Less creamy mango, papaya, guava, creamsicle.

Overall: Not the best offering from Drekker. This one has appreciable hop burn. Overripe orange, pineapple, and cantaloupe flavors. Paint-like. A lingering hop burn. Finish was sweet and low carbonation. Not up to par with their usual products. (Rating:",3.5

S: A sweet and fruity aroma of citrus fruit, hops, tropical fruit, coconut, and malt

T: Tasted of a decent shot of tropical fruit (mango, in particular), some coconut (more than expected; a good addition), a moderate amount of hops (less than usual for a DIPA), light malt (mostly in the finish - it gets drowned out by the fruit), and a lot of citrus (tangerine). A sweet, lively, and fruity flavor. More like an NE IPA in character, but still tasty.

Crushing Mass,"The body pours as black as night. No head. Not much carbonation. Doesn't matter. Doesn't need it. Aged over a year in Willet bourbon barrels, this beer is the big cousin to Lagunitas Willettized stout.

Nose and taste are all about the barrel. Blending wonderfully with the bourbon is a delightful coffee flavor from the addition of Dark Matter coffee. My memory believes this stout is CBS without the chocolate notes.

Mouthfeel is good but not as heavy as one might expect given the ABV.",4.5
Crushing Mass,This is definitely a great stout and I'm glad I like it considering I've been less than impressed with some of their other beers in other styles. This is no frills and exactly what it says it is. It's thick and syrupy due to the abv and the coffee flavor is akin to Big Bad Baptist for example as it's pretty biting. Was worth getting a 4 pack,4.25
Crushing Mass,"Got this from @Jzeilinger and Thank You for it.
The bottle pour is into a clear glass goblet and a thick and mostly black color liquid emerges. A dark tan colored head forms and then very quickly disappears leaving no trace of having been there.

The aroma is mostly coffee that has been fresh roasted along with a touch of bourbon. I thought I also caught some vanilla and oak.

The beer tasted like roasted dark coffee with hints of chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon, but mostly coffee.

Overall, I find it to be really good, and a strong coffee-dominated Stout. The high ABV is also a nice touch. Would I recommend this Stout? You betcha!!",4.25
Crushing Mass,"Drank from a 12fl oz (355ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Bottled 10-25-21
Served in a tulip

Fantastic label design. 3 Floyds always impresses in this department. As for the beer, it poured a deep brown/black hue and thinner than anticipated. A small cap of saddle brown bubbles topped the body, but it quickly dissolved. There was zero head retention and no lacing whatsoever. An oily sheen floated on top of the liquid.

The aroma was solid initially and improved with time. Rich and malty. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malt notes. Darker roast coffee also came through strong. Good dose of brown sugar sweetness too. There was a punchy booziness, but not much bourbon specifically. As the beer warmed, the nose became sweeter, punchier and more rounded. Some dark chocolate and vanilla notes also came forth.

The flavor profile was solid but not amazing. Malty and robust up front. Loads of roasted malt character. Hint of char. Roasty coffee notes were apparent but definitely not as strong as in the nose. Big boozy notes kicked in soon and intensified as the beer moved along the palate. Brown sugar was also noticeable. Touch of chocolate. More roast, char and booze on the back end and in the finish.

The mouthfeel was rather disappointing. It was somewhat oily and slick but quite thin for the style. The liquid contained a fine, subtle effervescence that seemed appropriate for a beer of this magnitude.

Crushing Mass was an enjoyable coffee stout, but the bourbon barrel presence was unfortunately quite subtle and the mouthfeel much thinner than anticipated. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this beer was that the alcohol was so well buried.",4.0
Crushing Mass,"Brief Review:

O: Ever since GI stopped doing BCBCS, I've been starving for a good BA coffee stout. Prairie's Mocha Noir blew me away last year, and here comes a new one from Three Floyds. This one's pretty decent. It's a little harsh up front, pretty boozy at 15.1%. Coffee is pretty acidic and very forward. It's nice and balanced on the finish though, ends more more drinkable than you think. Mouthfeel medium+, could be better. Overall could use a little more balance, maybe even a touch of sweetness from something.

Recommendation: Great coffee BA stout from Three Floyd's here, great to see them churning out some awesome one-offs again that are more affordable and available.",4.5

Crushing Mass,"Pours a dark brown to black color with beige edges and a half finger of tan head that swiftly dissipates. The nose has bold notes of bourbon upfront with a decent roastiness behind it.

The flavor also features bourbon combined with a modest sweetness and an astringent roasty quality on the finish. The mouthfeel is modestly sticky.

The alcohol never gets ""too much"" but it comes close as one moves down the glass.

I think that this will make for a good aging project. I'll be looking to pick up more for that exact purpose.",4.5

Relatively full bodied and slick feel with some slow-building, but sharp carbonation.

A nicely made little BBA coffee jawn. Reminds of SMS.",4.25
Crushing Mass,"Pours pitch black colt with a 2 finger thick brown foamy head that was packed with bubbles of all sizes, dissipating on the fast side while leaving basically zero lacing. Not unexpected for a BBA brew that sat for a year in Willet bourbon barrels. Wow, the nose is a coffee stout on steroids with fresh ground coffee, burnt coffee grinds, a bag full of coffee and espresso beans, charred wood, smoked grains, molasses, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, vanilla, oaky notes and bourbon. It’s got that Starbucks mocha Frappuccino smell but like it’s was poured over some of the best coffee beans you’ve ever inhaled. I could get into this first thing every morning.

The taste is really good, but a drop off from the aroma. The alcohol heat and thinness of the stout body take away from it a little bit, but the flavor is also really tasty. It’s chock full of fresh ground coffee, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, coffee beans, espresso, charred wood, smoked grains, molasses, dark chocolate, soy sauce, cocoa powder, bakers chocolate, hot fudge, cacao nibs, bourbon and/or dark rum, more bitter dark chocolate and faint piney hops as it finishes.

Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"appearance: very clear. pale gold, like a dark straw color. 1.5cm(approx) foamy white head that quickly sinks down to a very thin ring. no lacing, and the ring disappears fairly soon after beginning to drink.

smell: clean and grassy. minor funk (very very slight). slight overtones of hay. a light touch of malt.

taste: on initial sip, slight bitterness with more hay and some gentle tones of honey. as it lingers, bready malt appears along with some of that funk from the nose. long semi-dry finish with a flourish of bright but bitter hops.

feel: nice smooth carbonation. body feels heavier than you would expect, but medium-light at the same time. easily drinkable, goes down smooth.

overall: pretty good pale lager. more interesting than some other macro brews, but not quite up to craft standards. locally it was purchased at $10.99 for a 4x pack of 450mL glass swing-top bottles. not the cheapest for what you get but still an overall nice drinking experience. i would recommend this to a friend.",3.75

Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"So I deleted my last review and now I review again, as I think I just tasted my new favourite pilsner ever, Radeberger. An hour ago, this probably was. So I am going to review this again now to directly compare against it. From a corked bottle. If you try Grolsch from a can or an alternative bottle without a cork, it simply doesn't compare. I think the corked bottles are brewed in Holland, where as the others are brewed under licence, locally.

Fairly deep and dark for a pilsner...medium head with a combination of small and large bubbles.

Amazing aroma when you open the plastic cork...but actually the aroma from my pilsner glass is kind of frothy and a bit uninspiring. Especially after the Radeberger...

The flavour is nothing compared with Radeberger. That is now my favourite pilsner for sure. Now Grolsch really does taste like a mass market produced beer. I think the reason I gave it such a good review before, was linked to the rather terrible beers that I drank just before I drank it.

Hops are well balanced...kind of lightly Czech style. A little watery and uninspiring overall. Not much in the way of mouth feel, though there is some background bitterness that kind of lingers and comes to at the end. It tastes like it might have been pasteurised for a bit too long...but I guess for mass markets it needs to be.

One hour ago I really loved this, now after tasting it and reviewing while fairly sober, not so much ; )",2.75
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,Swingtop bottle. Nice beer easily drank. Far superior to Heineken.,3.25
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,Skunky,3.0
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Pale golden / straw in color, and quite well filtered for excellent clarity. Rather good and “scrubbing” carbonation is evident (and is equally evident across the palate).

Nose is neutral and “lager” like, with a better than average, upfront Noble hop character. Slightly sour/sharp… Pils like, and somewhere between a Pils and a Helles if I had to place it, but clearly more character to my mind than that of it’s obviously more successful competitor, Heineken. On the other hand, the malt character is on not as evident. Perhaps a result of the use of corn or another (in the “classic” sense of the word adjunct) adjunct? All signs would point to “Yes.”

Sweet and very slightly sour/acidic/sharp across the palate on the first sip. Good aromatic character (the really carbonation helps, here), and an almost herbal quality beneath its sweeter malt base. Tastes at once both richer -and- lighter in body: a contrast and a conflict. Even though it is not as “hoppy” as anything in the c.f. “Craft Beer era”, the hop bitterness does linger quite nicely throughout the drink.

Good mouthfeel, and the carbonation although ample, is much gentler than it first seems to be.

The taste for me is where this brand, Grolsch, has always shined over others of its very broad style of Euro Pale Lager. This is of course, judging from both memory (many previous encounters in many packaging and draught formats over the past thirty plus years), and re-reviewing a fresh, flip-top bottle — Best By: March 14 2023.

My rating is doubtless high, but for what it is Grolsch is a classic example of its style, and a longtime personal favorite.",3.5
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Quite nice, although seems to be only 4% in the UK. Has a lovely spry scent and a refreshing taste. Goes well with lunch.",3.0
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with the funky top that's kind of cool. Pours dark yellow with a thin amount of head. Biscuity, bread like taste with decent carbonation. Has a stale tastes that reminds me of beer drankin' while deployed in the Navy; not bad.",3.5
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Poured from swing-top bottle into a Grolsch logo mug. (I mean, why not?) Pale Amber color, with a couple of fingers of brilliant white head. Decent retention, with some pretty lacing. Aromas and flavors are muted a bit at fridge temp, but open up as the beer warms. Grainy and grassy, with a hint of peppery spice and lots of pleasant bitterness. Finish is clean and crisp, with no lingering off-flavors and no skunkiness. So is it a Pilsner or a Euro Pale Lager? Either way, it's pretty good.",3.75
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Attractive clear gold body with a large white head that left good lacing. Subtle aroma; malts impart a biscuit-like quality that pair well with the noble hops. No off notes, nothing skunky. A grainy, crisp, clean texture to the taste. There is a little sweetness and a bit of spiciness but no noticeable fruit. Pleasantly bitter with a well carbonated mouthfeel. One of my favorites of this style.",3.75
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Drinking one of these takes me right back to my well-spent youth. I always preferred this to its other macro equivalents, Heineken and Stella Artois. Slightly more complex, a bit more breadiness but also a suggestion of a hop bite at the end. And, the coolest bottle! Yeah, I'm being a bit generous with my score, but this is a whole lot better than Heineken, and definitely better than Stella, so there you go.",4.0
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Beautiful thick bottle, really really cool. Typical clear Pilsner look with a frothy white head. Smells like barley, unbaked bread, and other non sweet bakery goods, with I hate to say this, but a touch of weed. Simple taste, but clearly there is quality hops used which I can appreciate. Classic European Pilsner taste with its own thing going on coming from the hops. Refreshing but not exactly a summer type beer, like the lager of Guinness for myself (meaning, refreshing, but.. not a warm weather beer per say). Normal watery mouth feel, leaves a small aftertaste, especially at the back of your tongue. As you keep drinking the taste gets more casual, and being a Pilsner it’s not too complex, but you can still enjoy that different hoppy character that we see differently in European Pilsners, but that’s all you really get.
Short Verdict: better than ok, not great, but still enjoyable. Though I did drink it out of a old style beer bottle which could have enhanced it.",3.5
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Superb little number. I have found it goes well with beef, lamb, chicken and a fried brekkie.",4.0
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,Crisp classic. A touch single dimensional. Although the hop is the star of the show. Less hoppy alternative to Urquell. Solid brew. Definitely be back for more.,3.75
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Nose: skunky hopps, fresh cut grass and basic barley aroma.

In the glass: golden/ light amber looks tasty, if only it was

Palate: sour bitterness met with mellow cereals, very bland with the only characteristic making itself known being the hops.

Finish: bitterness met with a harsh sweetness, like poorly malted barley.

Don't waste your time with this one. There are plenty of better beers, this is like a worse version of Heineken",2.0
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Pours a translucent honey golden color, with a fast receding head. Smell is sweet caramel malt, grains,distinctive yeast that only Grolsch has. Taste is slightly bitter(no funk), with a delicious wash of quality caramel malts. A floral note is evident.Feels almost perfect . Carbonation is good, all the malt to hop ratios seem perfect. Even though this brand has been passed around almost as much as my old girlfriend it still has the same qualitative taste. Many, many stories where the Grolsh was involved. The cap today resembles ceramic but I believe it is plastic. 30 Years ago in NYC that real ceramic cap was a perfect stone for spleefers- Still really good,underrated-",4.25
Prince Percy,"10 oz pour on tap at Frisco Taphouse in Crofton. This has to be the perfect pilsner. Aroma and flavor feature crisp, off-dry bready malt, floral/spicy hops, and fresh-cut grass. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, and smooth, as drinkable as can be. Delicious.",4.75
Prince Percy,"Bottles picked up at the brewery, dated 15AUG22. Can’t emphasize enough how delicious this is. Had it on draft and then bought a few bottles and it got better each time. So crisp and refreshing with a hint of hops and infinitely drinkable.",4.75
Prince Percy,"Pour a dirty straw, slightly cloudy, bubbly quick disappearing head.

Nose is strongly herbal and floral, subtle Pilsner malt sweetness.

Taste is again heavy herbal and almost verges of having weed like qualities to me, verging on skunk. Minor sweetness.

Light body, soft on the tongue, not that dry or crisp with a low bitterness.

Different beer to be honest if I drank this blind I would not say it was a pils, it’s a little overly hoppy and not dry and crisp like a pils. Almost reminds me of a super light hoppy blonde.",3.5
Prince Percy,"500 mL bottle. Clear golden. Smells of grass, bread, and lightly spicy hops. Taste has a zip of lemony citrus up front followed by a strong bready malt flavor. Grassy and spicy hops in the finish. Medium light. This is outstanding. Maine is quickly rising in my list of favorite breweries.",4.5
Prince Percy,"Purchased at the brewery in Brunswick, Maine.

Crystal clear with a light gold color. The moderate head remains throughout the tasting with minor lumps and a continuous cascade of upward bubbles from the base of the glass. Minor spots on the glass remain after each sip.

Clean, refreshing soft malt start. It's a bit like a Helles, but the floral hop is distinctive, making this a beautiful example of the style.

The taste is a touch less soft on the tongue. There's a small berry-like presence. The body is neutral to full, richer than most pilsners. The carbonation is high as expected. The hop is still bittering but on the subtle side. Overall, a great example closer to the Czech version of pilsners.",4.25
Prince Percy,"Slow poured at Delaware Supply in Albany, NY.

This one pours a clear golden yellow color, with a big fluffy head and lots of lacing.

This smells like grainy malt, spicy hops, lemon rind, orange zest, and pith.

This is a little bit more hop forward than the typical pilsner, but that doesn't bother me too much, as it's definitely not overhopped. The malt character is really nice, with a light graininess, some breadiness, and a restrained sweetness. The hop character is spicy, herbal, slightly lemony, with a hint of citrus.

This is light bodied, clean, slightly creamy, and very, very drinkable.

This is an absolutely excellent first stab at a lager. MBC is obviously known much more for IPAs, but they clearly have impeccable brewing talents elsewhere, as well.",4.5
Prince Percy,"16.9 oz bottle into a pilsner glass.

Pours a clear straw color with a huge fluffy white head. Bubbles for dayz. Excellent head retention with a ton of cobweb lacing. Gorgeous looking beer.

The aroma is exceptionally grainy, bringing notes of cereal grains and fresh wheat bread. There's plenty of citrusy notes as well, namely lemon zest and orange rind. Grassy, herbal, and spicy. Nicely hopped.

The flavor follows the nose: Very grainy and bready to start, followed by some citrus and grassy notes. Lots of cracked pepper-like spice, with plenty of noble hop presence. Very clean.

The feel is light bodied with lively carbonation. Crisp, dry, and highly refreshing.

Overall, this is a great German pilsner. It's bright, crisp and very clean, and exceptionally drinkable. Plenty of sweet malts balanced out by an assertive hop presence.",4.25
Prince Percy,"Prince Percy Pils

Pours a brilliant pale straw yellow - nearly crystal-clear, and topped with three fingers of rocky white foam with good retention. Significant pacing and visible effervescence.

Nose: Very rustic, grainy pilsner malt. Almost saison-like, with wholesome, grainy, hearty notes of rye, wheat, barley, and crackers. Very dry aroma. Lots if floral notes, some hop spiciness, tons of grass, hay, farmhouse, fresh rain, and a lemon-lime note. Extremely bright, zippy, and fruity for a pilsner.

Palate: Greets the palate nearly bone dry with lots of grain - almost like pale malt, and a really nicely hoppy profile with fresh grass, lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit pith, as well as a European spiciness and a kiss of resinous bitterness. There's a very lively minerality to this, similar to Suarez or Hill Farmstead. Thr finish sees a reduction in lemon-lime, and an increase in grapefruit pith, grass, spicy hop resins, and raw grains.

Mouthfeel/Body: As with most MBC beers, this is light, crisp, snappy, vibrant, bright, and and refreshing as possible. No malty sweetness or weight to weigh it down, but plenty of flavour to keep it full. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy which really suits this well. Drying, slightly resinous finish.

Overall: I could go on and on about this, but all I really need to say is - this is the single greatest pilsner I've ever had. It's perfect. It's perfectly balanced, perfectly hopped, perfectly carbed, and just... Perfect! This is a world-class beer, so questions asked. If you enjoy pilsners, you need to have this. You'll understand.",4.25
Prince Percy,"Translucent golden hue. Great smell, with a nice grassy “bite” to it. Tasted like MBC ale (such as Peeper) meets Pilsner. Nice, lingering feel.
Didn’t taste like a classic, straightforward Pilsner to me, but more MBC ale meets Pilsner; not a complaint, just an observation. I find all MBC beers to be well-balanced, and this is no exception. Again, not a classic Pilsner, but very enjoyable nonetheless.",4.0

81/100",3.75
Prince Percy,"Bottled on 5/29/20

Pours a clear and effervescent pale golden straw body topped with multiple fingers of tight, eggshell-white foam; good head retention leaves a steady finger of cap, with massive, foamy mounds eventually comprising the collar and chunky, thick strands of lacing covering the glass.

Aromas of crisp, crackery malt evolve to fresh black bread crusts, and a building, grassy hop presence upfront; floral tones, and semi-sweet cracked pepper mark the mid-palate's transition to highlighting underlying suggestions of sulfur, grapefruit and stone fruits developing on the close.

Taste opens with peppery bread dough and fresh grass as a floral mid-palate peaks; rounded fresh bread with hints of lemon, peach essence, and grapefruit on the back end offer nuance to an otherwise clean, toasty finish.

Mouthfeel brings a soft, light body with a deftly rounded moderate-high carbonation; effortless palate, delicately fluffy peak into a mildly gritty back end sporting an even milder, bitter finish.

Ample complexity drawn from a straightforward pilsner profile in large part due to a calculated dosing of hops, this is an overall satisfying, unencumbered American-made take on the style with near-universal drinkability courtesy of a delicate touch throughout.",4.25
Prince Percy,"Pale gold body; lively carbonation; thick and sculpted white head. Bright, light, and herbal aroma; soft sweetness. Very clean flavor; subdued and alluring cereal grain base; gently toasted grain; light mineral taste; nice hop bitterness crescendo building midway through the sip and past the finish. Light body; crisp; smooth with a gentle warmth; soft dryness throughout.

There is nothing like a well-crafted pilsner. This beer offers the experience and delivers it.",4.25

Oasis King,"Canned on 9/1/22; consumed on 9/17/22

Pours a turbid, burnt orange body capped with just over a finger of white foam; decent head retention leaves a half-finger of rich cap, large, frothy collar, and limited array of chunky, webby lacing lining the walls of the glass.

Aromas of orange juice open to peach creamsicle, meandering to a syrupy mango peak; resins edge the back end of the bouquet as vague tones of gritty, grassy subtext linger.

Taste highlights orange zest upfront, with an oncoming each/mango sorbet dominant in the face of toasty coconut cream undertones; a slightly dank, grassy edge comes through toward the finish.

Mouthfeel is medium-thick and sports a subtle prickle of carbonation phasing to taut yet creamy textures through the mid-palate, leaving a slight, residual grit lingering in contrast to glossier, semi-juicy resins into the finish.

An overtly tropical sheen coats juicy resins into bright, pulpy IPA-shake vibes; fruit is effectively integrated, sweetness is not excessive, and coconut subtleties provide softer nuance to the whole.",4.0
Oasis King,"Pours an opaque murky straw color with a half finger of head. The nose has coconut and fruit juice notes. The flavor is sweet and fruity with a semi-dry finish. The body is hearty for the style.

I'm not sure what TH was going for here. But, this one is a rare swing & miss.",3.75
Oasis King,"Pours hazy, orange gold in color with one half inch head. Taste is tangerine, coconut, tropical punch Life Savers and mango. Heavy body, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter. Not my favorite King variant. Solid ipa but I am losing the base beer. Lots of tropical flavor but a pass for me. I think I would have been fine if they would have called this Tropical Storm or something but KJ has certain expectations.",3.25
Salvator,"Notes from 7/2/2022.
Poured from a bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass.
The body is dark reddish-brown with almost a finger of beige head. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is medium-low. There are notes of mostly sweet malt, milk chocolate and caramel malt. I detect a slight hop aroma.
The intensity of taste is medium-high. Wow! That's good! The flavor has a deep malty, chocolaty, caramel flavor with a mild hop finish. It's sweeter than other Doppelbocks I've had.
The feel is thick, fairly creamy, the carbonation is medium-low, the astringency is medium-low giving it a long dry finish.
Overall, I prefer that it's sweeter which is more to my liking than Celebrator. Although, I consider Celebrator a obviously superior Doppelbock. I will probably purchase this one more often.",4.5

Look:
Light and clear mahogany that leans to the red side. Initial 1-finger beige head that dissipates to a very thing coating. Some lacing, but not a lot.

Smell:
Sweet and malty. Dark fruits, toffee, and some lightly toasted caramel. Notes of honey and light brown sugar. A faint earthy tone can be detected.

Taste:
Definitely sweet, but not as sweet as the nose. Dark fruits and toasted caramel. Hints of nuts. There is an noticeable underlying earthiness that is lightly bitter. I also pick up faint hints of dry chocolate here and there.

Feel:
Smooth and slick. Somewhat syrupy. The body is on the full side of medium.

Overall:
A solid doppelbock that is on the sweet side. In some respects, it reminds me of an Old Ale.",3.75
Salvator,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a pint glass. Most definitely an old bottle.

The look is a bit lighter than expected, a light brown to amber, with a very light haze. On the pour very little head formed, I am unsure why. What did form completely disappeared over a few minutes until zero head remained. Honestly a beer without any bubbles floating on top is a little offputting.

The aroma brings us back to normal here, although I can smell a bit of age, it's not skunked or anything, just perhaps more fermentation notes. Some caramel malts peek through. Perhaps even some dry fruit notes.

The taste follows the smell but much more malty. The fermentation flavor is there alongside the dry fruits. But right behind that is a malt explosion. It's not a very sweet beer and a wave of dryness and bitterness hit at the same time but it rounds out the beer well.

Feel is largely dry, but somehow it seems like a head forms nicely with each sip only in your mouth where you can't see it. I'm not sure what happened here exactly.

Overall a nice tasty doppelbock. Would be better fresh I'm sure but some beers are just hard to get fresh so that does factor into the score a bit. Malty as a Doppelbock should be.",3.75
Salvator,"Finally picked this up in a variety pack, always wanting to try more dopplebocks when I can as they are infrequently stocked here. This one drinks very light for its abv, a tad thin. Some decent flavors of sweet malty goodness. Going to enjoy all 4, but won't likely seek this out again if it required purchasing 8 other beers I'm not jazzed about. If sold separately, this is a pretty darn good dopplebock.",4.0
Salvator,"Pours a ruddy brown, hazy copper with a thigh two inch thick head that dissipates over a few minutes. Aromas are mild but pleasant, mostly sweet malt, caramel, a little bit nutty. I only get very mild fruity notes myself.

Interesting and straightforward, but subtle and complex tastes. The thing that distinguishes this from other Doppelbocks I’ve had is a bit of this savouriness in the middle. It’s a little funky in spots like a lambic or saison, and a little sweet, nutty and savoury like a thick bodied very sweet beer. Almost a cheesy like thickness and aftertaste. I’ve tasted this in a few other German beers so I’m not sure what it is. I’m still new to all this, so I’m sure I’ll discover it as I go on, but for now I just don’t know what it is.

Malt forward with mild bitterness, very doughy, yeasty flavours that are particularly sweet. Roasted caramel malt notes abound, and strong toffee. No fusel alcohol notes here. There is a very mild dried fruit flavour of dried raisins and figs. Not as strong as Aventinus (regular or Eisbock) which particularly features these types of fruity notes. In comparison to that and other doppelbocks, Salvator is more sweet, sticky, and sticks to the bready desserts. I do notice some enjoyable banana flavour here as well, especially as it warms. As with many complex beers, a lot of notes are strengthened by it warming up, particularly the dark fruit notes.

Very much medium bodied, slightly on the heavier side, the feel is thick and creamy, and just a tad oily. Feels like you can chew on the doughy malt. Mildly carbonated, which really allows the flavours to rest on your palate, giving it a nice long evolution of tastes with a lasting finish. Very creamy sip, it gently foams on the back of your tongue on the way down. As I noted above, the alcohol/abv% is not noticeable.

Paulaner brews are definitely ones that pick styles and a few good flavours and aim to hit the bullseye on them. So they’re not as complex as some others out there, but excellent benchmarks of whatever style they choose to brew. Salvator is a very interesting Doppelbock. If your favourite thing in the world is sweet, malty beers, your rating will likely be higher than mine. If you like more hop notes, or bocks that are mostly fruity, more dry and less sweet, you will likely rank this lower.

Salvator has a lot of great flavours that are melded together quite well, subtly complex, with a unique sweet savouriness. This makes it feel less clean and crisp than the slightly more boozy, less sweet, more dry examples of doppelbocks. But what it doesn’t have in those arenas, it makes up for in its creamy, less biting drinkability, malty sweet tastiness.",4.25
Salvator,"Picked this up over the holidays at Gary's in Wayne, as I hadn't had anything from Paulaner in years. Love their beers and the ability to get them in these parts, and this was a great example of a Doppelbock as it was true to form, well-rounded, and easy to drink. In other words, it was fitting on a chilly winter's night such as this!

This had a lovely, almond hue to it with a frothy and full tan head that settled beautifully and evenly. Loads of bread, caramel, and chocolate in the nose as the taste contained some plum and fig along with a bit of toffee, dark nuts, and apple. Slick, moderately cloying, and nicely carbonated, this felt great on the palate as it went down nicely with a hidden alcoholic presence. Smoke, banana, and raisins lingered in the aftertaste as the warmth settled in once I finished this off.

Loved this beer and it's underlying potency as it was plenty strong but wasn't overt in it's heft. Without even realizing it, the ""Enjoy best before"" date on the corner of the label was 2/22 as this tasted great and held up well since it's bottling. The complexity of this emerged as it warmed up as this has me wanting more examples of the style - most of which would not measure up to a benchmark such as this.",4.0
Salvator,"Personal notes only: Needn't buy again. Has a bit of that Lambic Ale flavor I don't care for. Maybe it's the higher alcohol. Very caramel malty, but there are a lot of other options.",3.5
Salvator,"Bottle from John’s poured into pint glass. Boozy caramel, touch of funk.",3.75
Salvator,"Pours a dark red/copper colour. Nice thick frothy white head that sticks around noticably long.

Smells like chocolate,caramel, toasty, and definitely really sweet. Can't tell if the sweetness is from the chocolate smell or if there is something else there, almost fruity sweetness.

Taste is great. The caramel really comes out along with the dark chocolate, has a toasty and spiciness too it as well. It hides the high ABV extremely well. If someone told me this was 5% I would believe them.

This is my first doppelbock and I must say, I'm extremely impressed. Hits all the notes I wanted it to, some sweet, some toast, medium bodied, very drinkable. Delicious.",3.75

The initial pour unveils a dark amber ale with a short lived frothy head. The smell is sweet with an obvious bourbon scent. The first taste is remarkably smooth and rich, sweetness on the tongue with a mild pleasant bitterness arriving at the end which left me craving for my next sip. Ahhhhh, so yummy!

Color such a lovely translucent deep burgundy. Nose is barrel woods, sweet molasses, perhaps a nuance of tangy fruitiness in there too.

Smell is dominated by dark bittersweet chocolate and a Graham crackers cinnamon character that is slightly sugary and yet honey like. It is like a chocolate pie with a cinnamon Graham cracker crust. There is a dark bitterness underneath hat could be the coffee but it seems like more of a chocolate note.

Taste is very chocolatey, dark bittersweet chocolate that is lightened just a smidge by a light creamy vanilla character. Cinnamon is evident throughout but not really in your face, just a presence like in a pie. The finish has a light boozy touch to it reminding me that it is a bourbon barrel aged stout. This could get a bit cloying but it strikes just the right balance before going off the rails.

KBS - Cinnamon Vanilla Cocoa,"This beer leaves everyone thinking about what they'd change about it. This one has too much going on, just isn't balanced right. It's definitely too sweet, vanilla can come across really sweet. The mouthfeel is unpleasant, needs to be thicker, I can feel it separating into layers, the bottom of which is just corn syrup and water.

I feel like they were making a KBS for people that don't want a bourbon beer and just made it too sweet. I'm always prepared to slow sip a high abv beer but small sips just tasted even sweeter and less complex.

In the end this was difficult to finish, and expensive. Not the beer for me. The smell was great poured, but the taste was better from the bottle.

Edit to add: I generally love Founders.",3.0
KBS - Cinnamon Vanilla Cocoa,"A 12 fl. oz. bottle, bottled on 3rd September 2021. Poured into a snifter glass.

Appearance: Pitch black with a one finger brown head that had good retention and left nice lacing.

Aroma: Cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, with notes of raisin and bourbon.

Taste: Light to moderate bitterness, dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, black coffee, some sweet notes, cinnamon, vanilla, dark fruit, raisin, bourbon.

Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, velvety, full to medium bodied with soft carbonation.

Overall: Great aroma, and taste was nice, but the cinnamon was perhaps a bit strong. It was sweet, but there was a good bitterness that balanced it, such that it wasn’t overly sweet. A good variant, however I do prefer the original KBS more.",4.25
KBS - Cinnamon Vanilla Cocoa,"I smell it all. The normal KBS coffee notes and a nice hit of chocolaty vanilla but it's the cinnamon that is most tantalizing.

Maybe my pallet isn't quite sophisticated enough but the initial taste is like a little sweeter KBS. It has the coffee and cocoa and is really delicious but outside of the added sweetness it's just KBS.

It's thin for a stout because that is a signature quality of Founders and it has a very mild fizz. The really special aspect of this beer is finish. It's a little bitter but the vanilla and cinnamon shine through in the end.

This is good but it should be, it's KBS. I really appreciate the added sweetness and the follow through on the promise of vanilla and cinnamon. Overall I give it a 5.7 out of 6. Spectacular!",4.75
KBS - Cinnamon Vanilla Cocoa,"This isn’t the world beating stuff of KBS legend, but it’s a good imperial stout. Almost like the milk from a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch mixed with a BBA coffee stout. It’s rich and thick… sticking to the feel of Founders imperial stouts and you can’t go wrong with Founders stouts. I remember the first KBS and CBS I had years ago… Just the class of them! To this day I can think of no other barrel aged stout that has given me that sort of feeling. The sheer brilliance and wow factor was revolutionary. To me they’re still the cream of the crop and best in the world. This doesn’t reach those marks but it’s one of those unique takes that’s great to enjoy! I’d recommend this to people looking to delve into the depths of big, dark stouts! It has the sweetest to entice anyone.",4.0

KBS - Cinnamon Vanilla Cocoa,"From 12 oz bottle marked bottled 09/02/21 2106 6

Pours into my tulip glass a high viscosity fully opaque near black with a creamy brown head. Great retention and fluffy lace.

Scent is bourbon, raisins, chocolate, vanilla, mocha java and a hint on cinnamon. I think I also get toasted coconut.

Taste is chocolate, bourbon, raisins and dark fruit. The cinnamon comes across more strongly on the taste than the nose but is not overwhelming. Vanilla. Rich dark roast coffee. Chocolate covered cherries. Dark cocoa. A hint of char and roast. Sweet but not overly sweet.

Mouth is oily and weighty.

Drinkability is good for a 12% brew. Alcohol is not noticeable and my glass emptied quickly enough that I could imagine having a second.

Typical of the KBS series this is a fantastic Imperial Stout featuring rich chocolate coffee and bourbon notes. The cinnamon doesn't really add much and I think I prefer the other variations in the line but either way this is a great stout.",4.25

Pumpkin Sombrero,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass
Appearance – The beer pours a dark brown color with a one finger head of tan colored foam. The head fades rather fast leaving but a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is big of a cinnamon and nutmeg along with lots of pumpkin and cocoa. Along with these smells comes notes of roasted malt and a bit of a Crème Brulé like smell.
Taste – The taste begins with a roasted malt backbone flavor matched with a light roasted pumpkin flavor and lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. From the start there is a cocoa flavor, which with the roasted pumpkin get stronger as the taste moves forward. All the while flavors of caramel and molasses, which were light upfront, grow more potent in nature, adding more sweetness to the brew. At the end a touch of crème and a surge of the pumpkin, leaves on with a nice rich, roasty, spiced chocolate pumpkin taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is slightly thicker and chewier with a carbonation level that was on the low side. For the stout nature and the big roasted and pumpkin flavors of the brew, the feel is good and makes for a nice slow sipper.
Overall – A rather nice pumpkin stout. The Mexican chocolate spice nature matches the pumpkin flavors well and creates a nice overall balance. Rather fun!",4.0
Pumpkin Sombrero,"A pint bottle poured into a draught glass. Look has an impressive head of brown foam that slowly compresses down; a deep, dark brown body lies beneath the depth of foam. Pumpkin puree is dominate on the nose along with clove and a bit of sweeter malt. Taste brings out the rich chocolate (but the spicy chili-like sensation is buried) up front while the pumpkin puree and clove-y spiced flavor is heavy on the backside. At times the puree has an almost syrup-y like quality on the tongue that sometimes fights a bit of ABV sensation (not entirely surprising at 7% ABV). Feel is heavy and creamy with the chocolate making a surprising resurgence in the aftertaste. An interesting offering but would have preferred the puree dialed back a notch and the chili-spice increased a few notches.",3.75

Pumpkin Sombrero,"Was a pretty decent blend of Two styles a Mexican Chocolate stout and a pumpkin ale. I think I liked the base beer more since it came off as more sweet this one being roasty with some chocolate vanilla and a good punch of cinnamon/nutmeg. Not a huge fan of pumpkin stouts to be honest they are often dry and over spiced but this one walks the line pretty well. If your looking for actual chili kick don't expect to find it well covered by any pumpkin spices.

Overall not my favorite by this company could be epic as a BBA beer but it was a decent find when I was in Erie PA looking for new beers to try!",3.75
Pumpkin Sombrero,"Look – Pitch black body with two fingers of almond-colored head

Aroma – Well, not sure what to say here. I get a big load of nothing. There are some malty notes and deeply-hidden chocolate presence, but other than that, it smells devoid of anything. Weird.

Taste – Again, not a whole hell of a lot going on here in the taste either. Maybe some chili pepper skin, but no heat to speak of. The base stout itself is rather enjoyable with subtle chocolate and even black cherry and licorice. However, there’s really nothing “Mexican Hot Chocolate” or “Pumpkin about this at all.

Mouthfeel – Full-bodied. No alcohol presence and is a rather smooth and velvety ride.

Overall – As a standard stout, it is really good. That being said I was promised Mexican Hot Chocolate and Pumpkin, and I got neither. It kind of paints me into a corner in terms of rating as I do enjoy this beer, but it did not deliver on what was promised. If you want a pumpkin beer, go somewhere else.

Leffe Brune / Brown,"Pours a nice dark mahogany brown with a half finger of dense foam that quickly returns into a spotty cap

Strong yeasty and caramel malt notes are forward on the nose, mildly toasty. Figs and raisins, dried dark fruit. Bananas as well as spices such as clove and allspice.

Taste follows the nose pretty well. The yeasty notes are lightly doughy, pleasantly toasty caramel malt, the lower abv% (in comparison to other strong dark Belgian ales) gives it less of a rum/alcohol tinged inflection on the notes, which does let the lightly peppery and spicy esters and fruits have more of a fresh character. Mild bananas, banana bread, cloves, maybe even bakers chocolate, and plums and fresh figs.

Medium-light bodied, moderate carbonation, gently tickles the sides of the mouth and tongue. Average length finish that tends to the dryer side, relatively sweet, the spicy yeasty and bready notes most relevant on the finish.

Leffe is the slightly cheaper, super available popular Belgian ale you can find everywhere. It’s an excellent dip into these kinds of beers. Hard for me to ever dislike any kind of beer that is malty and yeast forward. Question is, how to judge this beer? Against all others in the Belgian category, or against beers in general? These notes are practically explosive compared to macro brews, likely to blow your mind the first time you pick up this 6 pack instead of Bud. But it’s a little light and mild in flavour profile compared to other dark strong ales from Belgium. Overall, it’s quite a fine beer, balanced, not overtly complex but it’s very crisp and enjoyable.",4.0

I think it's interesting how this basically tastes exactly like Leffe Blonde with darker malts.

The beer is dark from the front, clear ruby with a back-light, with ample small bubbles of carbonation. It is topped with a thick, tan-to-off-white, head with excellent retention. Thick lacing remains on the opposite side of the chalice as I take a sip.

The taste is much richer than the subtle aroma would lead you to expect. Rich and malty. Banana bread, toffee, pepper and clove. Sweet caramel controlled by the spicy, slightly bitter middle and finish, resulting in a finish on the sweet side. While it would be classified by me as a sweet beer, that is overstating. It is nicely balanced and enjoyable.

The mouth feel is smooth with a creamy remainder on the tongue and throat, broken up by the carbonation.

the beer pours a clear mahogany color with rich ruby highlights on the sides of the glass when held to the light. Several active streams of carbonation rise to the surface. A large pillowy khaki colored head of 4.5 cm foams up even with a very gentle pour. This foam recedes slowly and leaves some dense lattice as I swirl the glass. the foam never fully fades and is a very sturdy surface covering throughout.
Aroma is malt forward with some toffee and a bit of brown sugar, but also a rich dose of cloves and other spice notes. Maybe cinnamon mixed in there. No hop presence and the nose is appealing to me.
First sip reveals a medium body with soft tingly carbonation. Texture is a little slick and the beer drinks easy.
Flavor starts with a bit of caramel which then rolls to spicy yeast character. I get cloves again but here anice flavor comes through, which was undetected on the nose. No hop presence again and the booze is well hidden. This is a nice approachable beer with a good amount of complexity in its yeast profile, without being over the top.

Curiosity One Hundred Twenty Six,"Traded for this the other night as I had no idea what beer this was until I looked on their website. Indeed, this isn't marked on the label as it was quite artistic on the outside and enjoyable out of a glass as this was plenty sweet and fruity with a nice underlying slickness tying everything in together.

Like so many of their more popular offerings, this was hazy, golden, and topped off with plenty of fluffy and long-lasting head. Loads of soapy lacing remained down the side of my pint glass as a thick ring remained near the top with the semblance of rings below it easily covering up a majority of the remaining space. Lots of candied orange, orange blossom, crystalline sugar, and purely dank hops were in the nose as the taste wonderfully followed suit. A nice amount of nectar, passion fruit, exotic tropical fruit, deep forest, and a hint of weed emerged in the taste once this fully warmed up as this had a nice complexity to it without any particular aspect being overpowering. The carbonation was light as this wasn't slick nor sticky, but was nicely balanced when all was said and done.

The amount of alcohol in this was spot-on as I felt a slight warming kick in after I finished this off, but it was never a distraction nor a detraction during any point of my time reviewing this. Dated 8/13 with ""KEEP CALM DRINK BEER"" written above it, this was worth keeping calm with as this was a textbook New England IPA with lots going for it. Aside from a few bits of bitter sediment that had to be swirled out of the bottom of the liquid, this was subtly wonderful and the reason why I keep drinking Tree House's offerings after all of these years!",4.25

canned on date of 9/28/21.

Appearance: Black bodied beer with big and tall medium brown head. head pours easily 3 fingers tall. spotty lacing. head drops down to ring around the glass.

Smell: All raspberries; really jammy raspberries. Raspberry flesh and seed. Is this a fruited lambic? Maybe a very faint hint of bourbon and chocolate; I might be stretching a bit though because I want to be optimistic.

Taste: Jammy raspberry flesh and raspberry seeds. So much raspberry! All I taste is Raspberry. Deth Tar is missing in action here. Maybe a faint hinting of chocolate and bourbon. Finish is tart & jammy raspberries. It still tastes good, but boy do I really want some stout in this raspberry stout.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied stout. moderate carbonation levels. Really creamy texture to the body of this stout. Not boozy at all. Very drinkable.

Overall: This is hard to pass for a stout. SO much raspberry it obliterates any trace of Deth Tar. The Raspberry is spot on and delicious. It tastes really authentic like a raspberry should. Revolution really missed the balance of stout and fruit here. I keep wanting more Deth Tar from this beer with every sip. Haymarket brewing Clare's Thirsty Ale absolutely decimates Deth by Raspberries. This is a one and done for me, glad I did not buy a 4 pack of this stout.",3.0
Deth By Raspberries,"Canned 9/28/21; drank 10/17/21 @ the Yarchives.

Black/brown appearance.

A rough pour yielded a huge dark tan head; decent lace.

Raspberry sorbet, milk chocolate & faint bourbon heat notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Raspberry sorbet & milk chocolate flavors up front; tart raspberry, mild oak & faint booze heat notes on the finish.

Balanced, in that it gives both the sweet and the tart elements of raspberry room to shine; thin enough to quaff but you shouldn't. An interesting, tasty fruited stout. I'd have another...",4.25
Nectarous - Banana,"16 oz can.

Pours a hazy pale gold color with a large, very effervescent white head. The head has pretty good retention. Leaves some splotchy lacing.

The aroma brings notes of tangerine, grapefruit, and orange juice. There's some very faint banana lingering in the back.

The flavor has a lot of zesty citrus, bubblegum yeast, and the absolute foggiest idea of banana. Like someone dropped a banana near the tank but not actually in it. Disappointing.

The feel is typical Tree House. Creamy and very soft. Surprisingly dry on the finish.

Overall, this is a good NEIPA, but also a disappointing one. There's, at least according to the can, banana puree in this beer? Could have fooled me. I probably wouldn't even pick up that flavor in a blind taste test. Sometimes added fruits can overpower the base beer, but in this case, it's like they forgot to actually put the fruit in that they advertised on the can.",3.5
Nectarous - Banana,"Hazy yellow brown gold, very fluffy white head, pretty good lacing on the glass. Smell is fruity, creamy, green banana. There's a dryness to the smell that I wasn't expecting. Taste is tropical fruits with a backbone of banana bread if you made the banana bread with fully green bananas, it has that dry banana almost bitter feel to it... like a plantain chip. Honestly, I wouldn't have bought this if it hadn't come in a mix pack, but I'm not disappointed. It's an interesting rif on their usual flavors to me.",4.25
Nectarous - Banana,"Pours ultra hazy, pale gold in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is big citrus, tangerine and light banana. Medium body and carbonation, bitter. I really expected more banana in this and therefore it is disappointing. I was hoping for a more unique beer. Not bad but nowhere near the other Nectarous beers.",3.5

P3 Oktoberfest,"Pours a dark, clear amber color. Thin off-white head forms on the beer without much in the way of head retention.

Aroma has notes of toasted bread, caramel, toffee - very malt forward. There are lighter notes of spicy hops coming through as well.

Taste follows the nose with notes of toasted bready malts, caramel, toffee, with some spicy hops on the back end. Its got the caramel and toffee notes, but its not at all sweet.

Feel is light, crisp, easy drinking. Moderate carbonation. Very dry finish.

Overall a solid oktoberfest from P3.",3.75
P3 Oktoberfest,"Pours a clear, deep copper color with a finger of lightly tan head that goes away quickly. Not as much head retention or lacing as you’d expect.

Aroma is overly-toasted bread, slight green apple, toasted grain, light caramel and brown sugar, prune, earthy hops, spice.

Taste follows the aroma well. Lots of toasted bread, slight green apple, lightly caramel iced brown sugar without getting sweet, plum, earthiness and slight floral from the hops.

Medium body. Appearance made this look a little under-carbonated, but it drinks just fine. Slightly crisp, slightly soft, slick, and slightly gritty on the finish. Smooth and quite drinkable.

This is an outstanding Marzen. Has a hefty and complex malt profile without making the beer heavy. Nicely balanced by the classic hop character. Phase Three’s lager program is vastly overlooked.",4.0
P3 Oktoberfest,"No canning date (released on 9/9/20, so presumably canned within a few days of that date); consumed on 11/10/20

Pours a clear, deep copper body capped with two fingers of dense, fluffy, off-white foam; great head retention recedes slowly to a thin veil of semi-creamy cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a temporary array of large, splotchy lacing around the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fresh green apple dominate upfront, with a caramel malt undertone steadily combating the fruitiness; heartier undertones of brown sugar and burnt toast nod toward the otherwise slighted roaster notes as hints of prune give a brightness to the close.

Taste shows a lighter green apple presence against balancing caramel malts mirroring the bouquet; a touch of brown bread, root beer, and brown sugar form over the mid-palate before inviting a light, grassy undertone into the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a light-medium body alongside a moderate carbonation fizzing out into the mid-palate, where a semi-dry/crisp texture develops into a more rounded, oily malt character on the back end; the finish brings a distant heft and even grit with a refreshing peak into the swallow.

A genuinely eccentric and untraditional Märzen that, against all odds, comes together fairly well; prominent apple tones blend steadily with an unexpectedly subdued malt profile for a sweeter take on the style with a distinctly autumnal overtone. Nothing spectacular, bur unique and solidly made.",3.5

P3 Oktoberfest,"Love this oktoberfest, has everything you are looking for in the taste. Dark amber body with a tan head that pours perfectly, then fades in a collar with lacing. Smell features toasted caramel, toast, earth, a touch of hops, and malts. Taste is where the beer shines best, everything from the smell with toffee and roasted nuts added, great depth and crispness. Body is medium, toasted, crisp, and slightly bready.

Seems almost impossible to get FRESH Toppling Goliath here unfortunately.

Pours into my tulip a peach gold shade with a big fluffy creamy ecru head. Lots of particulates in the beer. Head is long lived and leaves fluffy sheets of lace.

Scent is citrus and tropical fruit. Soapy and floral. Papaya, guava, pineapple.

Taste is muddled tropical fruits. Citrus. Pineapple. Mangoes. Malt presence is constrained to a light pretzel note. There's a minty green note also.

Mouth is creamy with a nice weight to it.

This is a very impressive beer considering it is 3 months past its BB date. I can only imagine how great this must be when fresh.",4.25
Pseudo Sue,"This is pure, unfiltered, and unimaginably delicious beer. 16oz can poured into a snifter at 50F. Opaque hop slurry looking like a glass of orange juice. Head is white, like soap suds, that just hang around the entire time, leaving mountains of lacing on the sides of the glass. Total hop slam to the nostrils; full on dank citrus. Taste is a spectacularly hoppy mess, with a consistency like orange juice, but with hop pulp instead of orange. Good lord this is amazingly hoppy, and full bodied, with very little alcohol to be found, as it is masked by the hop insanity. This is a pale ale? So says the can. Did they accidentally can a bunch of King Sue in the wrong cans? Nope. Picked up a 4 pack of each, and this Pseudo Sue might as well be a solid single IPA when compared to King Sue. Overall one of the best beers I have ever had.",5.0
Pseudo Sue,"Pours a thick hazy deep amber with an overflowing foamy head.
Bursting with mango, orange scent, grass with fresh rain.

Look: Pours a pale golden color with a lot of floaties that eventually settled. There was a nice, fluffly white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. The beer became a lot hazier after pouring the bottom of the can.

Smell: Has a pronounced citra hop aroma - lots of grapefruit peel, orange, grassy, with green bell pepper notes on the back end. Smells peppery also and has subtle cantaloupe notes also.

Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose. Strong grapefruit flavors with a moderate to high bitterness on the finish that lingers but does not overpower the palate. It's very drinkable. I think that the flavor filled out a bit also after pouring the bottom of the can.

Feel: Has light to medium body, nicely carbonated.

Overall: Solid single-hop pale ale. To me, this toes the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Personally, I would probably put this closer to IPA territory than pale ale, but I can see both opinions. Regardless, it's very delicious, highly drinkable, and accessible.",4.0
Pseudo Sue,"One of the better Pale Ales out there. Has a very nice hazy appearance with light fruity tropical smell. I like the taste of the citra hops, juicy and mango citrusy flavor.

Pseudo Sue,"Very hazy apricot color with moderate white head that retains well and produces some nice lacing. The aroma is citrus, pine resin with possible mango, pineapple and passionfruit notes, very juicy.
The taste is pine resin and grapefruit up front, mellowing into mildly sweet light malt with lots of tropical fruit notes - orange, pineapple, mango, passionfruit. The finish is lingering passionfruit with a return of the pine, very interesting and tasty from start to finish.
The body is medium, moderate carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.
Altogether this is one tasty and enjoyable brew that I would place somewhere between a NEIPA and a pale ale but it is outstanding, whatever. I already want more.",4.5
Pseudo Sue,"Simply put, this is a very nice IPA. It’s single-hop Citra, which is unusual in todays world. It’s hazy, but not extreme. It’s fruity, but not overly fat and sweet. Balance is the right word. I normally don’t line hazy IPAs very much, but this one I actually line a lot. A classic, had several gallons of this over the years, drank it again after taking a 2+ year break - it is still very good, I like it a lot. Did I mention: I’ve got a thing for Iowa. That might have played a role, too.",4.0
Pseudo Sue,"Pours a hazy gold.

Light and inviting floral and citrus aroma.

It tastes surprisingly juicy on the tongue, with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Mild hop bite and malty sweetness behind.

Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Overall a great beer. It’s less sharp and more balanced than Zombie Dust or similar Citra APAs, but quite flavorful. And light enough to pair with spicy food.

Poured from a can dated one month ago.",4.25
Pseudo Sue,"Appearance: Cloudy straw orange, fluffy white head, very good retention.

Aroma: Hops forward. Citrus notes of oranges, tangerines. Tropical fruit.

Flavor & aftertaste: Citrusy & tropical fruit hops flavors. Restrained but balancing bitterness. Medium sweetness.

Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Light to moderate carbonation. Medium length finish with trailing bitterness.

Overall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus & tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking.",4.0
Pseudo Sue,"Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA.",4.25
Pseudo Sue,"Pours a cloudy, strawberry wheat color with a white foamy head that hangs for a bit. Some nice lacing surrounds the glass as I sip.

Smells of citrusy hops and a touch of tropical fruits.

Tastes great! Very refreshing.

Mouthfeel is solid. Light carbonation with a nice viscosity.

Overall a solid brew. Haven’t been able to get this in our area until a few years ago and took a long break from reviews. Picked up a 4 pack to try. Worth the wait.",4.75
Basic Rebecca,"I love nearly all of the stouts produced by Prairie, and I can add Basic Rebecca to the list. I was told Basic Becky was better...but I'll review it at a later date.

Smell of this one is cinnamon and spice, with a slight pumpkin to it. Poured into a glass, there was minimal head...and I was trying to pour it so that it would produce some froth. It's thicker than normal beer, but not syrupy and very little lacing on the glass.

I tasted it both cold and after it was allowed to warm up, either way the flavors were fairly consistent. I prefer the warmer option, to each their own. It tastes like a spiced cake with definite notes of pumpkin, and then the bourbon barrel boozy flavor kicks in...with a spicy flavor that hangs thru the finish.

I really like this one. I assume it's somewhat seasonal, so if you see it, grab it.",4.75
Basic Rebecca,"Interesting take on a fall stout. Nose is very aromatic pumpkin and spice. Taste follows accordingly, with a big hit of dark chocolate malt base. Barrel comes through in an undistracting way, lending a dry oak finish. Mostly a one and done for me, but decent to try.",4.25

Octoberfest Beer,"Pours a light copper with tiny little bubbles feeding a solid two fingers of off-white, vaguely wheat-y head that eventually settles into a mildly lacy ring. I've seen prettier beers but this looks fine. Smells, somehow, like Fall to me. I realize that really doesn't mean anything and isn't terribly helpful, but there you go. It's malt-forward, as expected. There's some vague, sugary candy undertones like cheap caramels or candy corn. Tastes pretty nice. Not as sweet as implied by the nose, but still very malt-forward. Some herbal bitterness from the hops cuts things on the back end. Tasty and well-balanced. Crispy as a cool Fall morning. Very solid all around.",3.75

I don't know what it is. It has a simple hearty malt and bready flavor, but but it also has this kind of has this gross almost watered down bottom of the barrel cheap American beer side to it too. Almost like someone took a Märzen and mixed it with a Bud Light. I don't know if it's me, but just that particular six pack got like to warm and in the sun at one point, but it was off. Not entirely gross, just not as good as I was hoping with some gross notes.",3.5
Octoberfest Beer,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into the Bell's pint glass. The brew is a nice dark looking amber, just a thin cap of tan foam, this beer is clear with light carbonation.
What this marzen lacks in appearance, it makes up in aroma. From the time the cap was popped there has been a pleasant malt, fresh biscuit aroma, slightly sweet.
The flavor is mighty fine also, following the aroma perfectly. The mal is up front, sweet fresh biscuits, caramel, finishing with a nice light bitter touch of hops, with a touch of pepper spice.
The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, the carbonation does not much to the feel.
This one is all over the rating map, it lacks a bit on appearance, smells great, tastes like a marzen, but misses on the nice creamy feel. This is very good but not great.",3.25

Octoberfest Beer,"Drinking this about half way through my yearly sampling of all things O'fest related and, while not blown away, neither is it a drain pour. Sports a clear amber appearance with a small white head and light lacing. Subtle toasted malt aroma and if you stick your proboscis deep enough into the glass there is some faint herbal hoppiness. Notched some sweetness early on in the taste but that faded away while the softer malts remained the focus. Hops played a minor supporting role. So what's the average rating for a marzen style O'fest? Didn't look it up but think this one should be right about there.",3.75
Octoberfest Beer,"Sampling a cold 12 oz bottle poured into a .5L dimple mug.
The beer pours a clear copper to almost golden color. Lighter color than I anticipated. A thin eggshell white head foams up, maybe .5 cm. This foam fades to nothing pretty quickly.
Aroma is lots of toasted grain and even a little nuttiness. Not any caramel notes here and hops are kinda absent too. I hesitate to say the nose is one dimensional, but it sort of is. Not a bad nose, just not complex.
First sip reveals a light to medium body with fine, gentle carbonation and a very smooth texture. Beer drinks very easy for physical traits.
Flavor is similar to nose, lots of toasted malt and grainy flavor. There is a little bit of nutty flavor and here, the faintest wisp of caramel. Only the faintest hop presence on the finish. Sort of a black tea note. No hint of ABV.
A drinkable tasty brew, that is good for what it features. Tasting events really call attention to differences in examples. Id try others again before this one.",3.75

Octoberfest Beer,"Canned 7/20/21

Bell’s is honestly not a brewery that impresses me all that much. Everyone seems to love them but nothing I’ve had has felt much better than average. Anyhow, we keep on trucking through this tasting event, with yet another beer coming from Half Time’s mixed 12 pack. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is yet another one of these that trends quite sweet in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of caramel malt, rich honey, orange rind, cracker, and earthy hops

In taste, this shows promise early on, but loses the plot a bit after the swallow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting herbal hops, caramel malt, toasted brown bread, and light pepper. The swallow brings notes of sticky honey, toffee, caramel malt, golden raisin, and a touch of vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp yet slick beer. Finishes a touch sticky but still refreshing

This one was also not that great. I don’t know what it is lately, but some of these just haven’t been impressing me. Oh well",3.5
Octoberfest Beer,"The first impression is everything; it's a Marzen with all the soft creamy mouthfeel you expect and caramel, muffin, bread, but also distinctly light and crushable, as I expect a festbier to be. As it is lower abv and lower body than expected, it does let up on the gas, and the profile goes from start to finish pretty quickly, lingering flavors is lightly lemon, barely herbal. Really one to crush en masse, won't slow you down.",4.25
Octoberfest Beer,"2021:

Appearance: Appearance: Pours a deep fiery orange, amber color with a creamy, white head that is lattice, lacy, and clinging to the sides of the glass. SRM of 10-11. The color looks very similar to the label on the bottle which is interesting (4.25)

Aroma: Mild aromas upfront of breadcrumbs, brown bread, toasty malts, with a bready finish. Hints of herbs. (3.75)

Flavor: Mild to moderate flavors of pale malts, bread dough, bread malts. Toasty, but then overall finishes balanced and smooth. Mild. (3.50)

Feel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Bready and creamy, finishes smooth. (3.75)

Compared to Surly Oktoberfest 9/6/21: Pours a slightly darker color. More bread crumbs, toasty malts on the aroma. Less lemonflower and honey.

Compared to Great Lakes Oktoberfest 9/24/21: Pours a lighter color. Similar aromas. More toasty and balanced. Less rich caramel and cherry sweetness.

Overall: I found this one to be slightly better than 2020. It has a nice toasty malt profile and drinks fairly smooth. Nothing spectacular and lacking hops, but the malt flavors are on point.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020:

Appearance: Pours a deep, broze orange color with a creamy, milky off-white head that clings to the side of the glass. SRM of 14 (4.25)

Aroma: Mild aromas here. Mostly toasted bread with only hints of caramel and even less cinnamon. Mildly bready. A light touch of tropical orange underneath. Faint bread mostly, but it's there. It get's breadier as it warms. (3.25)

Flavor: Flavor follows with mild flavors. Bready and creamy. A rubbery yeast in the middle, before it finishes with more bread and cream. Slightly earthy, but not really. Finishes bready and smooth with a bit of cream. Mild, nicely subtle, but underwhelming. (3.50)

Feel: Bready, full, and creamy. Medium-carbonation and creamy. Finishes full. (4.00)

Compared to Sierra Nevada's Oktoberfest 2020 8/30/20: Pours a slightly darker color. Milder aromas. Less orange and pine soap. More bready overall, but milder.

Overall: Like last year this is a milder version of an Oktoberfest Marzen. The It is bready, creamy, and smooth. Could use more spice as it is quite simple and fails to define itself a flavor. Mildly bready, but it's there. Not bad, but I want a bit more here. (Final Rating: 3.68)

2019:
Appearance: Pours a deep fiery orange, amber color with a creamy, white head that is lattice, lacy, and clinging to the sides of the glass. SRM of 14. The color looks very similar to the label on the bottle which is interesting (4.25)

Aroma: Aromas of lemon, honey, and lots of corn. Very much like an adjunct lager or cream ale. A touch of grass but no breaded malts like I would expect. (3.25)

Flavor: Flavors follows the nose well with lemonflower, honeysuckle. Drinks like a cheap American or Czech-style pilsner. Slight bread but no toasted flavors at all. Finishes relatively dry. (2.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied for the style. Creamy and low to moderate carbonation. (3.50)

Overall: This is a let down of an Oktoberfest as some others have mentioned. Drinks like a slightly heavier, cheap American lager. Could also be mistaken for a blonde or cream ale. Not an Oktoberfest or Marzen. It malts taste like cheap adjunct malt flavors. Very simple beer. Maybe a cheap Vienna lager at best. I don't really know what there is here to appreciate. (2.99)",3.75
King Sue,"Well-deserved hype for this one. Finally found it relatively fresh, canned 08/18 and consumed 09/22. Super smooth, delicious Citra all the way, and the IBUs hardly noticeable given the balance achieved. Hope I can find its siblings fresh as well.",4.5
King Sue,"Pours a hazy grapefruit yellow with a four finger head that leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma is orange, pineapple and a hint of mango. Taste is lighter than expected, very orange with pineapple mixed in. Nicely bitter but not overly so. There is a slight sweetness to the brew. Nicely done.",4.25
King Sue,It's just so wonderful and drinkable and sniffable and did I say drinkable. IT's great stuff and T Rex on the can is cool beans. My problem is finding it fresh. The store I usually go to has stuff on the shelf that's past the best buy date and I'm not spending 18 bucks on a four pack of 16 ozs. This same store was selling single 16 oz cans of 10 day old King for ten bucks. Perhaps I should talk to the manager.,4.25
King Sue,"King Sue Double IPA by Toppling Goliath. 7.8% ABV 100+ IBUs. This is really interesting…it’s got some bitterness up front and at the end but not nearly what the IBUs would indicate. Nice orange, mango and some pineapple in the middle with a little lemon or grapefruit at the end. Fair amount of carbonation as indicated by the head. Very nice lacing. Not quite the same color as the pictures on the brewery website…more pale golden yellow than the light orange on the website. Really good….",4.5
King Sue,Can. Murky with lasting head and lace. Extremely fruity pineapple and citrus aroma with some raw dough. Medium sweetness buried under the juicy tartness with almost a hint a grain. Doughy full body. Lively carbo stops short of a bite. Juicy juicy juicy. A classic NEDIPA if you like that sort of thing. I don't.,3.0

King Sue,"What can I say? Hop onslaught. Hop smoothie. Hopadelic. Hop juice galore. Poured into a snifter at 48F. Looks like straight orange juice with a fluffy white head that lasts forever. Smells like orange juice and white bread. Tastes of orange rind. Thick consistency that is somewhat filling. Alcohol is there, but not outstanding due to the level of hop intensity.

King Sue,"Best New England style IPA I have sampled. Smooth, full of flavor and great mouth feel.",5.0
King Sue,"Super hazy/cloudy yellow/orange like pineapple juice with a touch of orange. The head is substantial, retains well and manages some nice lace.
The aroma is grapefruit, pineapple and pine resin with a hint of light caramel malt in the background. The taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of Cara Cara oranges, lemon, apricot, mango and passion fruit, slightly sweet with a light malt background, balanced by plenty of grapefruit pulp and pine resin bitterness. The finish is dry with lingering pine resin and a white pepper note.
The body is full with moderate carbonation, smooth but with a fell of light pulp content even if not visible.
Altogether this is an amazingly tasty and enjoyable brew, everything is balanced for maximum impact that makes the ABV almost unnoticed..",4.5

King Sue,"On tap at the Irish River in Louisville. The color is like a mix of pineapple juice and grapefruit. And so is the nose. Very smooth hazy IPA. Not an overload of any flavor. Not even too boozy. Such a nice blend of grapefruit, tropical, and hops.",4.25
King Sue,"From Chicago and I've been drinking a lot of the weekly hop butcher which is almost always amazing, Phase 3's dipas, Microphone, Riverlands these stand out too. But over the past few months theyve all been hit or miss. And for $20 a 4 pack it hurts when you miss. Then i came back to an old favorite--Toppling Golliath. its got just about everything i like about all these beers, everything i hope for every time i by the new weekly. BUT HERES THE THING. King Sue has ""it"" every time. Real big fresh hoppy tones (citra) but so fresh, like they use real hops vs canned or dried hops if i had to guess. The pale ale version pseudo sue is just as good.",4.75
King Sue,"Purchased at Pennridge Beverage, Perkasie, PA. $22.50/4pk (16oz cans)

A citrusy, reiseny, slightly bitter taste. Slightly sweet. Very good IPA.

Medium consistency, medium carbonation.

King Sue,Excellent,5.0
King Sue,"Full disclosure first: I'm usually not a fan of hazy IPAs as they are often too sweet, too murky, and not bitter enough for an IPA. But there are exceptions, and King Sue is certainly a great one. The look: King Sue pours with a beautiful white head that lasts, on top of an unattractive yellowish dishwater look. If you don't mind the murky dirty look, you'll be fine.

The smell is hoppy, classic Citra, with more fruity complexity. The taste is grapefruit and other tropical fruit flavors. It's less tart than some Citra beers. The big plus is that it's got solid bitterness as an integral part of the package. I don't like hazy IPAs that are basically alcoholic fruit juice, but King Sue is a real IPA, with bitterness and a noticeable ABV kick. This beer packs a flavor punch.

The feel is very thick, almost like a fruit smoothie.

Overall, it's certainly the best New England IPA I've had, with a standout flavor profile.",4.25

On the pour a decent 3 finger foamy white fine head formed that dissipates at a medium rate to a decent cap and ring. Carbonation is fine and the body is a golden light straw. Some lacing, decent.

Aroma has some Metallic smell alongside a very light lager yeast that isn't the most crisp, but I was expecting worse. Slight tartness, but a decent but super light crackery malt. Quite light but better than expected.

Taste follows the aroma with some vague off notes but nothing terrible. No hop bitterness and a light crackery barley. Quite watery tasting.

Feel is light and carbonated. Pretty nice, amd the finish isn't instant either. Super drinkable, and not as close to seltzer as michelob ultra.

Overall this is a decent light beer. Better than coors light, keystone, natty, and michelob ultra. About on par with miller lite however. It's a light beer its close to water but not the closest.",2.75

Oktoberfest,"A: The apperence is perfect for what one would expect from a Marzen. Pours a nice deep amber color with white foam as it's head.

S: Smell is pretty much what one would expect from this style. Hints of toast, baked bread, and floral armoas from the hops are present here.

T: Not bad but it is slightly more hoppy than I would prefer from a Marzen. IBU should be between 20-25 rather than 30.

M: Medium bodied lager. Drinkable but better if you sip rather than crush.

O: Not a bad Marzen, 3.75/5.",3.75
Oktoberfest,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a six-pack for $10.99. ""Best by 11/21/22""; this may have been canned as recently as 7/21/22 as this just hit stores. In that case, this beer would be just 12 days old.

Look: Pours a beautiful clear copper color. There was a nice off-white head that quickly receded to almost nothing, leaving a faint lace on the edge of the glass.

Smell: This smells really nice. Up front, it's very bready and mildly yeasty with sweet malts and slightly earthy, subtle floral hop notes and orange blossom honey. Caramel toffee, almost chocolate note on the back end. I get this interesting vanilla cream soda type of note on the back end, which is probably an effect of the Munich malts. This sounds weird, but I also get a subtle dry-roasted peanut note on the finish.

Taste: That is a well-made Oktoberfest Marzen Lager. It's bready, malt-forward, with a very mildly bitter finish that has floral hop notes. It has nice caramel malt flavor that is nicely tempered by just the right amount of bitterness. Notes of orange peel and pith on the finish, which linger mildly yet long and ultimately outlast the maltiness. Some of that vanilla cream soda perception from the aroma comes through on the finish on the palate, which is cool.

Feel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of chewiness. Carbonation seems appropriate, probably wouldn't hurt if it was just a bit more carbonated as I drank it quickly yet it seems to have gone flat towards the bottom of the glass.

Overall: It's very tasty. This is my first Oktoberfest beer of the season and the first time that I have had von Trapp Oktoberfest. I think that it is also the first time that I have had an Oktoberfest as early as August! For me, it's really good and I enjoy it. However, I'm not sure how sessionable it would be for me (and it's probably not designed to be) because it is so malty. That being said, they made it to be quite balanced and tasty.",3.75
Oktoberfest,"Clear amber-bronze with modest effervescence and a finger of off-white head that leaves moderate lacing.

Just a kiss of cherry-and-raisin sweetness in the nose.

Medium bodied for the style with tight, low-key carbonation.

Excellent balance. Very quaffable.",4.0
Oktoberfest,"Von Trapp Brewing ""Oktoberfest""
12 fl. oz. can ""BEST BY 12/02/21 10:26""

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy deep amber/copper colored body beneath a full head of off-white foam. Normally a hazy Märzen would be an issue but no one seems to care anymore. The aroma is as expected: sweetish, bready, and caramelish with some floral and spicy noble hops in the background. The taste is also as expected given the aroma. The hops remain floral and spicy... perhaps more peppery than spicy; I doubt these include any Saazer, Tettnanger is more like it. That peppery spiciness helps to balance the sweetish, bready malt along with a median bitterness that's somewhere between 30 on 40 IUBs. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp. The head held up really well and I still have a solid surface covering beneath walls of lace. It ticks all of the boxes for the style (except for the clarity) so it's just a matter of the intangibles, or the overall qualities that make a beer great or not. I think it's pretty damned good but not a classic.

Oktoberfest,"12oz can into a pint glass. Best by 12/2/21, so a couple weeks inside the wire here.

Looks very good in the glass. Medium amber body with a full white head. This persists in good form throughout leaving scattered lacing.

Sweet caramel malt aroma.

On tasting, fair amount going on. Solid caramel malt base. Out of this a burgeoning bitterness arises.

Mouth above medium, finish a lasting bitterness, and a little drying.

Overall, and I understand bitterness is not what you want in a Marzen, this is actually a pleasant touch, cuts the sweet. Well, smashes, not cuts. Marzen purists might not want to go here.",4.0
Oktoberfest,"Dropped off at our table just as some autumnal storm clouds were rolling in, the appearance is chill hazed amber to brown with a khaki foam head that retains well as a thick, lumpy blanket curled at the ridges and leaving spongy lacing.

Dry, medium bodied, moderately carbonated, short lived finish.",3.75
Oktoberfest,"It is hard for me to be enthusiastic about non-traditional recipe in a very traditional style like the O-Fest. Von Trapp's is at 35 IBU which is in the non-traditional range. But, it is a well-structured beer.

Von Trapp's Looks the traditional O-Fest amber and a respectable foam. First Smells are the malts, quickly followed by grassy hops (OK, but not traditional) and, then, some faint lingering spicy hops which do more than linger throughout the Taste. Drying, bitter hops take over what could still be a sweet, malty drink. Good bubbles and festive in my mouth.

As for my micro review, there are things to like about von Trapp: a taproom in picturesque Vermont, family multi-generational business, finding a good recipe and gradually expanding to share it. They also focus on lagers, which not enough micros do. I may even have reason to visit Stowe and, if I do, I will visit von Trapp.",4.0

We’ve arrived at the last day of the Oktoberfest tasting, finishing off with a beer from one of the lager kings, von Trapp. Yet another beer provided by Half Time, the last of the beers in their mixed pack. I’ve only had 2 other beers from them so far, but if those were anything to go by then this will also be great. Let’s crack it open

Pours a cloudy amber gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Oh yeah, there's some definite bite in the nose on this one, pushing it closer to a Festbier. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy hops, white pepper, pale malt, light toast, toffee, and some honey to smooth it out a bit

In taste, It absolutely keeps up the promise of the aroma, bringing a super firm bitterness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting spicy hops, white pepper, crackery malt, lemon peel, and light caramel. The swallow carries on with its bitterness, bringing notes of peppery hops, pale malt, toasted grain, and light caramel

A medium light body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp and zesty beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

This one was very good, though from von Trapp I expect nothing less. A nice way to end off the tasting thread",4.25

Looking a little cloudy in the glass and colored medium amber with an orange hue it is capped with one inch of khaki foam that slowly recedes to a persistent ring. The nose is subtle but nice, opens bready and tightens up with light toast, Noble hop and light citrus aromas. Taste is not sweet at all, light on malt flavor and is overpowered by moderately bitter citrus and spicy hop flavor. When it warms I begin to pick up on light grain and corn flavors. The body is medium-light, soft, somewhat creamy and has just enough carbonation to give it some crisp edges.

F: Medium bodied and lively.

O: I had high hopes for this one, after particularly enjoying the Von Trapp Dunkel during Lager Fest. Unfortunately, this is more a hopfest than a maltfest, for me.",2.25

The beer pours a bright clear copper color with a large fluffy beige head foaming up, even with a fairly gentle pour I get 4 cm of foam pretty easy. This foam fades leaving some scattered lattice and remains as a sturdy surface layer throughout the sampling.
The aroma on this beer is very mild, I get a bit of toasted multi grain bread and some light caramel. Not really any hop character on the nose.
First sip reveals a medium to lighter body with very fine but prickly carbonation.
Flavor is toasted malts and some dough with a bit of a nutty flavor and only very mild hints of sweeter caramel. I do get some bite with a black tea bitterness on the finish. The finish is also very dry the bitterness lingers after each sip.

Smell: Toffee and dark breads dominate with the slightest hint of spice mixed with grains. Smells slightly nicer than a standard American Marzen.

Taste: Lots of dark breads up front that slowly blends into a moderately sweet malt. Not a caramel malt taste at all, seems more in line with a Bavarian import in that regard. Finishes with grassy and slightly bitter hops and a bit of spice that is exceedingly pleasant on the tongue.

Feel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. This beer finishes perfectly dry, similar to the other heavy hitters of this style. Perfect drinkability for fall weather.

Low effervescent head releasing baking spices and toffee notes. on sipping charcoal and tobacco with a mid palette weight of maltiness and subtle hoppiness. burnt caramel and toffee with pleasant lee-zy notes on the finish. cloudy mid-brown color.,4.75
Tynt Meadow,"Pours into a tulip glass a deep walnut with a ruby tinge a thick light tan colored head atop that has some real lasting power.Big fruit and yeast come thru in the nose,a bit of caramel/vanilla comes into play more as it warms,very nice.Flavors are not as rich and sweet as I thought they might be,fruity with some bitter chocolate and even bigger earthiness in the finish.Oh man has so much going on in the looks and aromas but the flavors seem a bit off for me.",3.75

Nose sweet malt, toffee, caramel, dark candi sugar and molasses like, a little caramelized banana candy, dark figgy fruits and little raisin, hint of butterscotch pudding, sweet toasted candy malts, with a bit of perfumey alcohol

Taste sweet malt again, bsicuity toffee, caramel, butterscotch toffee notes, more fruity esters, candied banana, fig, date, raisin, hint of perfumey alcohol, mild bitter spicy hop notes, general sweet toasted biscuity malts, a touch molasses and syrupy notes, drier finish, med bitterness with lingering mild spicy hop

Mouth is med to a bit fuller bod, hint of warming alcohol, med to higher frothy carb

Overall not bad, nice esters, good sweet flavors, nice malt, not a huge fan of the bitterness but makes sense with the English taste on it.",4.0
Tynt Meadow,"Lovely rich russet body with a creamy beige head. Piles in the corners, but not really much lacing.

The aroma is really interesting. Fairly unique, I can't quite put my finger on it. There's some warm fruit that's more in the rum-raisin variety, maybe a atouch of buttery caramel, and an interesting higher note that almost has... I don't know like it's not quite all the way into licorice, it's a little more sharp and fresh than that... more bay laurel than anise. But it kind of enwreaths the whole thing and is... interesting and compelling.

The flavour takes similar cues, but explores them slightly differently. There's sweet toffee, there's toasty raisin bread, there's some of that classic leather and like.. tobacco marriage of that same profile into the more earthy/plant-based realm. The licorice/menthol/whatever kind of note doesn't really emerge on the tongue, I think the role is taken more by the tobacco side of things.
The finish has strong evidence of hopping, in a piney vein. Creamy and sweet blend with this earthy bitterness to linger, aided by sharp carbonation.

It's certainly interesting and I do rather enjoy it. I think the hops move in a bit much at the end, similar to an american style barleywine, but that's a minor nit to pick.",4.25
Tynt Meadow,"With the traditions of Trappist ale broadening into the British landscape, it only makes sense that the brotherhood of that region takes on the taste of that region as well. Brewed in the strong English Ale character, Tynt Meadow gives the Trappist beer portfolio a unique and classic taste.

Mout Saint Bernard's Abbey rolls out Tynt Meadow, a deep mahogany ale that's cast in a dim and foggy haze before sitting underneath a rich sepia-stained lather. Malty aromas of toffee, cola and slight chocolate precedes an earthen perfume of dark, dried and pitted fruit, a hint of tobacco and leather with a twinge of vinous spice on the nose. Sweeter and richer tasting, the early palate is introduced to those condensed grain flavors of sorghum, chocolate and toffee.

As richly textured as it is flavored, the beer's sweetness saturates the middle palate to lay a foundation of malt where the flavors of date, fig, apricot, apple and plumb rest upon. Condensed, dried and macerated in its taste, the fruits lead into a soilish taste of tobacco, rye and a general mossy earthiness. Trending balanced in its bitterness, a broad and woodsy finish is accompanied with hints of sherry, fennel and sarsaparilla.

Full bodied, yet still relaxed in its sense of drinkability, the matured ale meets all the hallmarks of classic British Stock Ale and Olde Ale but with a slight nod to aspects of more Belgian-like Dubbel Ale. Finishing on the maltier side of malty-dry, the beer closes with a broad aftertaste of fruit and spice.",4.0
Tynt Meadow,"I'm glad this finally landed stateside. Poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a Chimay chalice. Light caramel sauce colored pour, with a thin light tan head that disappeared in short order. I didn't decant this, so there was quite a bit of sediment in the glass. Soldiering on, though. I'm not getting the chocolate notes that the brewer mentions, perhaps because it was poured cold. I am getting notes of roasted malt, a little dark bread, dried fruit, peppery spice, yeast funk, and a hint of tart apple. A slightly sour note carries over to the finish and lingers on the back of the tongue. There are unmistakable umami notes, which I love and which I often detect in some wild ales and bottle-conditioned beers. Overall, a very good beer that's worth seeking out.",3.75
Tynt Meadow,"L: Hazy light brown, hardly any head.
S: Nutty, sweet, and alcoholic. Caramel, whisky, faint hops, roasty malt.
T: Quite roasty. Upfront molasses and a nice hoppy backbone, then big leather notes, fig, nuts, and a finish that blends toasted malt and whisky flavors. There’s a pronounced hoppiness that lingers after each sip.
F: Wet, and alcohol is fairly masked.
O: I was very excited to try this and I wasn’t disappointed. It’s almost like a lighter version of an English barleywine, without a loss of complexity.
To me, this is what beer is.",4.75
Tynt Meadow,"This is a very beautiful beer. Poured from a bottle into a tall stemmed wine glass that was in my hotel room. Slightly murky golden brown color with a creamy beige head and excellent curtain lacing. Smell and taste of toffee, figs, dates. Some dark chocolate and sweet apples.

O - This is a really enjoyable, well-brewed beer. Would definitely buy again.",4.0
Tynt Meadow,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a medium to dark mahogany brown with light haze and a fine, one finger khaki head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, raisins, figs, dry caramel and a hint of cocoa. Flavor is dry biscuit and caramel malt, raisins, dates, light grassy hops, hints of nuts and cocoa; a little rye-like tartness in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. It's been a while since I've had this style, but remember it with fondness. This has and excellent malty body reminiscent of an old ale, but with more dried fruit character. Interesting light chocolate and nut notes. Hopped lightly, with a mild hop bitterness with little herbal qualities. A slight tartness in the finish as I recall from most of this uncommon style of English ale. Very enjoyable. Great to have an example of well made, British Trappist brewing.",4.25
Tynt Meadow,"Thanks to Merchant du Vin for bringing this in to the U.S. Best before January 25th, 2024 - enjoyed on July 16th, 2022. Poured from a 330mL bottle into my small nonic. Served around 50F per the brewery's recommendation.

Dark chestnut/burgundy body with an active rocky wheat cap. Vague lacing; poor retention.

Raisins, plums, leather, ester-laden yeast notes. Rich caramelized malt.

Deep, rich malt notes - melanoidin forward with brown bread, coffee cake, and toast. Jammy, faintly nutty, with not quite moderate bitterness throughout. Medium finish with a hint of char/smoke around the edges. Potent and complex.

Medium-light bodied, a bit fizzy, with restrained alcohol.

A unique Belgian-influenced traditional English strong ale. Hints of Dubbel, Winter Warmer, etc.",4.25
Tynt Meadow,"A: Pours slightly murky dark mahogany in color with light to moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate ruby red + garnet red + chestnut brown + cola brown + amber colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall dense creamy foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a large patch of medium thick film covering approximately 95% of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of dark + toasted + smoked malts with a light to moderate amount of dark fruit (raisin + plum + date) as well as brown sugar sweetness. Light to moderate aromas of tobacco + chocolate + coffee as well as some hints of oakiness/woodiness.. Light aromas of spicy yeast. Hints of earthy + herbal hops.

T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of dark + toasted + smoked malts with a light to moderate amount of dark fruit (raisin + plum + date) as well as brown sugar sweetness. That is followed by just shy of moderate flavors of dark unsweetened chocolate + coffee + tobacco as well as some hints of oakiness/woodiness. Then there are moderate flavors of spicy yeast. Finally there are slightly heavier than light flavors of earthy + herbal hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which slowly fades away leaving a light hint of the smoked malts behind.

M: Slightly heavier than medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and dry.

O: Drinks pretty easily considering the complex malt flavor profile and the higher ABV though the alcohol is well hidden and there is a smooth dry mouthfeel. Really loving the combination of flavors and aromas from the English and Belgian traditions and the smoked malts is a very nice touch.",4.25
Tynt Meadow,"330ml bottle. Poured out a clear, dark amber color with a small, tan head of fluffy foam. It left sticky rings of lace on the glass. It smelled a little smokey with toasted caramel, roasted malt and some coffee. Nice smoked malt flavor with coffee, chocolate and toasted caramel.",4.0
Tynt Meadow,"A: Pours up a deep, cloudy mahogany with quickly receding, soapy, caramel one-finger head, nice lacing.
S: Immediate notes of toffee, chocolate, coffee, some dark fruit and a a savory quality.
T: Rich and warming right away, the butterscotch, malt, and toffee notes take the lead here, there is a mild bitterness in the finish that keeps the beer from being too decadent, offering balance, there is also a subtle tartness in the finish, which I don’t find to be really suggestive of anything specifically, I also get something that very subtly suggests peat or tobacco, hard to say which.
M: On the fuller side of a medium body, a nice and balanced carbonation.
O: I really like this a lot. I think this is a splendid first offering from the monks of the Mount Saint Bernard Abbey and I’m excited to see what (if anything) they release next. It’s rich but not quite decadent (thankfully) and has a very accessible complexity to it, if I had any gripe, it would be that I would have liked to have gotten some of the dark fruit from the nose in the taste and perhaps a bit more of those savory notes as well.",4.25
Tynt Meadow,"Drank out of the bottle on a walk home from downtown. Nose and smell are a satisfying blend of semi sweet chocolate and brown sugar mixed with sweet fruit. This was a great shelf find.

Everything about this beer made it great. Armosphere is a huge part of the enjoyment of a beer. This nailed it.",4.25
Tynt Meadow,"did not realize there was an english trappist beer until i stumbled upon this one in my travels, cool that it exists, but i didnt love the liquid, i guess i expected something more belgian, since that is mostly what we get from these operations, no matter where they are, but this drinks all malty and uninteresting on the fermentation side, almost like a heavy scotch ale or something, not a bad beer, just different. its deep reddish brown cola color in the glass, molasses toned, with a frothy khaki head that slowly settles, looks a bit dense from the bottle but lively enough too. the nose is weirdly sweet and spicy, i get some earthy character, some umami too, and almost soy thing there, but also a concentrated long boiled grain base, even some chateau type specialty malt in it, sugary and heavy, but distinctive and pretty good. i get all of that in the flavor too, maybe a little peppery element thrown in and some stewed fruit, rum raisin, and old decaying wood. its the ferment thats not quite there for me, even in the absence of belgian esters or something, i wanted more than what seems to be pretty pedestrian english ale yeast, bready and present, but samey and incomplete in its work, more residual sugar here than i can handle too much of. it drinks oddly stronger than it is too, like this isnt a crazy abv, but the beer feels boozy and massive for some reason, maybe all the body, and as much as i appreciate this for being a little different in this trappist space, i also dont think its technically wonderful, which is something i have come to expect from this designation. more carbonation would help it, but drying out is the biggest thing. an attempt at balance is made though, some bitterness is there in the finish once it warms a little, a sort of heather and tea herbal thing, maybe from hops, maybe from actual herbs, gentian root or something, its subtle but it helps and adds a little intrigue. i enjoyed tasting it, but was glad to be sharing the bottle. somewhat of a novelty for me. do these guys make any other flavors or just this one?",3.75
Tynt Meadow,"Pours a very deep, dark mahogany colour that is fairly cloudy. Two and a half fingers of dense foam slowly compile into a finger thick head that lasts a decent while.

A strong, dark English ale that is also Trappist, I’m looking forward to this unique blend! Which you can smell on the nose which gives me a decent whiff of chocolate, dark fruit like cherries, figs. Caramel malts add more sweetness, with a wooden and slightly floral character in the background.

Taste is, wow, I’ve never had a beer like this before! I’m going to do my best to break this down into different flavour profiles of the beer. Starting with fruit — prunes, dark cherries, and figs. Some dried and sugared qualities here. Delicious. Spices — licorice absolutely is present, aniseed, caramelized sugar. Cinnamon, maybe? Could just be the sugar. Malty flavours present, caramelized and roasted malts. Dark chocolate here compared to the lighter chocolate of the nose. Likely due to the mix of flavours, the wooden notes I get come with a whiff of smokiness. Not quite like a Rauchbier, but a smoky flavour is absolutely present. Even moderately savoury in character. Earthy here, molasses, and a slightly yeasty, slightly breadiness is left on the palate when all is said and done.

Medium bodied with average carbonation that lightly prickles the tongue, fairly smooth going down. Bittersweet finish leaving the ghost of the spices and chocolates, a roasted, wooden bitter character balancing the sweet malts and bready yeastiness left over.

Beer is very powerful in aroma and taste. Complex, but more than that, it’s unique. You’ve never had a Trappist, or even just regular beer in general, like this before. Blending spiced beers, English ales, and strong Belgian ales and dubbels, it’s a product that is uniquely its own and inimitable. Check the website for the cool way they source and make their beer. Love this, and glad I bought the last one as an extra for the cellar a week ago!",4.25
Tynt Meadow,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Mar 3 2023 and served slightly chilled.

Pours a deep copper-chestnut brown hue with reddish highlights, producing one finger of soapy, foamy, khaki-coloured head that dissipates within two minutes or so. A bubbly collar of suds remains in place, but with little in the way of lace initially - though that collar really clings to the glass, depositing lace as the level drops with each sip. Woodsy and herbal on the nose, with discernible booze and a malt-forward profile - fig, prune and grape, with caramelized malts, treacle and toasted bread, as well as hints of spice and licorice.

This is a bold-tasting beer: utterly unique in my experience, combining some of my favourite aspects of strong English and Belgian ales. I'm getting dark fruit flavours such as black fig, date and prune at the forefront, with sweeter flavours of treacle, toffee and toasted, bready malts developing soon after. Mild suggestions of dark chocolate towards the finish, with woodsy, herbal hops and peppery spice yeastiness tying up the back end; hints of licorice, burnt sugar and earthy bitterness persist into the aftertaste, which is a little warming. Medium-full in body, with relatively soft carbonation that meekly agitates the surface of the palate; feels smooth and satisfying to sip. I could drink another glass of this, but to be honest 330 mL seems about right.

Final Grade: 4.44, an outstanding A grade. Tynt Meadow is one of the finest strong English ales I've encountered to date, and I'd highly encourage beer geeks everywhere to seek this beer out and try it as soon as possible. There are definitely some Belgian dark ale influences going on here, so it's more of a hybrid than a pure English strong - but I feel that these two styles are fairly complementary, working very well with each other, indeed. Fantastic stuff, should've grabbed more, etc. - more importantly, I couldn't have asked for a better way to celebrate my 2750th review. Cheers BA!",4.75
Tynt Meadow,Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry figs and raisins with some candi sugar notes and caramelized malt notes. Taste is also a mix of dry raisins and figs notes with some caramelized malt notes and light toffee notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation and lights arming alcohol notes. Well brewed with a nice complexity level.,4.25
Tynt Meadow,"Pours a crystal clear dark ruddy brown color. Two to three fingers velvety off-white head forms on the beer. It starts to dissipate, but ultimately settles in with a nice layer of foam on top of the beer.

Aroma is slightly oxidized - there are lovely notes of raisins, dark fruit, dark bread, brown sugar and fig.

Taste follows the nose with notes of dark fruits, dark bread, brown sugar, figs, molasses with some estery yeast notes. It has definitely got some oxidized notes, but they actually work well within the overall profile.

Feel is thinner bodied, but somehow hefty with a noticeable alcohol heat to it even all these years later. Prickly but mild carbonation.

Overall it is a really unique and quite enjoyable Trappist ale.",4.0
Tynt Meadow,"Pours and smells like a trappist. But is it one?
The nose is of plum and figs, perhaps apple, and of course malt. The taste is as a trappist ought to be, with a British twist - bitterness. Slightly thin, with a warm, boozy finish.",3.75
Tynt Meadow,"330 m bottle served cold into a tulip. LCBO purchase for around $4-5 CDN. Best before 02/02/2023.

Appearance - Dark honey brown that appears a dark brown in glass. A finger of light tan head with yellowy brown highlights rests on top. Average staying powering and no lacing to speak of.

Smell - Boozy, treacle and molasses with a healthy dose of ripe fermented dark fruits (plums, raisins and figs). Some apples maybe in there too. Smells like a serious heavy hitter of a beer. Trace amounts of woodiness. More malty and adding caramel as it warms.

Taste - Wood and earthiness, some mustiness, grape must and apple skins. There's an element of treacle and molasses in the background but comes in much later. Some suggestions of smoke. Leather is very prominent. Complex and quite strikingly different that the nose. Complicated.

Mouthfeel - Full bodied in the way it behaves in your mouth, but not a lot of carbonation also gives a lighter feeling. Bone dry. Booze is present but feels the way it should for a 7.4% brew (maybe feels a bit higher).

Overall - Complex and hard to nail down, tasty but your nose and mouth may not always be in agreement on what the flavors and aromas are. Quite delicious and ever evolving, in that sense reminds me of some of the finer Belgian brews (dubbels, tripels, quads and high ABV saisons) in that they are ever evolving and the flavors will change significantly even from the beginning to the end of the beer as it warms. Excellent brew.",4.25

25th Anniversary Ale,"This beer looks great, the first sip was damn near immaculate, it tasted like the cinnamon gum drops but with a more intricate spice blend. However after that I've never gotten it again. This would be a solid Belgian style Christmas brew though regardless",4.0
25th Anniversary Ale,"Guess i'll just be lazy and award it a straight 4 all across the boards. Pour is lovely, a ruddy copper with a 2-finger off-white capper, quickly receding to a thin gurgle on the surface and perimeter. Nose of citrus and floral notes, a little booze to burn the nose hairs. Taste is bittersweet, notes of grapefruit and overripe mangos. Not a bad melange, but the bitter hops are quite dominant (almost IPA-ish?). Swallow & aftertaste the same bittersweet, more the former than the latter.

Nice to try, but i doubt i'll be slobberin' to grab up any more than this 4-pack.",4.0
25th Anniversary Ale,"Built like a dubbel ale but scaled like a darker and stronger Belgian ale, the brewery of Ommegang is settling into their mid twenties with a clever spiced ale that's deeply rooted in tradition.

Pouring a rusty and ruddy reddish brown before building a slight sepia stained froth, their 25th Anniversary Ale leads with a sultry scent of brown sugar, dark fruit, bright spices and a tingle of spiced rum on the nose. Sweeter to taste, the malts lead the flavors with those brown sugar, cream caramel, toasty breads and savory molasses to suggest something of spice cake or coffee cake.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, the fruit flavors spring forward with plum, red grape, date, fig and raisin. Hints of maraschino cherries keep the sweeter tone in focus while a balance of fresh cracked peppercorn, orange peel, paradise seed and coriander offset the fruit and sweetness while adding a brightness to the finish. A late drying trend allows for the taste of spiced rum to emerge with a warm red wine character.

Full bodied, creamy and nougat-like, the beer's bold stature closes with a warm brandy-like sensation but with a flavor profile that's friendly like abbey dubbel ales. Its a clever recipe with pristine brewing execution for a beer fitting for a quarter century celebration.",4.25
25th Anniversary Ale,"I am a Big Fan of Ommegang and Duvel's management style. So I am glad to celebrate Ommegang's 25th anniversary and their 19th anniversary together as the North American crafters' wedge to bring the Belgian tradition to this side of the pond. This is an appropriate brew to commemorate their great success.

I just bought a 4-pack in a beer run to Woodman's in Kenosha Wisconsin. And I'm glad I did.
My first bottle tells me that this Grains of Paradise makes a powerful malt; spicier than any grain I'm familiar with other than rye. Of course, that much spice means that the brewer needs to be skilled. And of course, Ommegang is.

I will give a more detailed review of the second bottle.",4.25

Centennial IPA,"I think this is my favorite IPA out of dozens of others that I've tried. I absolutely love the piney smell and taste of centennial hops. This IPA has a perfect malt balance to the ABV percentage and leaves a slight stickiness on your lips. There is nothing wrong with this beer and I've only had this beer out of a 19.2 fluid ounce can and is only sold as singles in only one liquor store out of the 3 we have here in Uvalde, Tx. and all 3 of them suck bad compared to liquor stores in much larger cities but I sure would like to try this beer out of a bottle. Cans tend to effect the flavor of any beverage. Anyway that's my take on this IPA because in my book it's a masterpiece and hats off to the brewers that put it together and made it happen. I read a few really negative reviews that I don't understand but it's possible they picked up some that have gotten hot and then cooled off no telling how many times. I think they should give it a second chance and change their reviews accordingly to their 2nd experience with it. It deserves a higher overall rating than it does for a beer with it's amount of character. I hope this beer never disappears. Hope my review helps others that are looking to try something new and enjoyable in the IPA realm of the craft beer world because this one might just make you cream in your jeans. Be careful!",5.0

Flavor: Holy Honey! Follows with a strong earthy honey and a sweet white bread component. Some light grass & flower on the end, but finishes with a glazed honey sweetness. More pale rather than caramel malts. Not dry. Pale and sweet witha slightly flowery finish. (4.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Low to moderate carbonation. Finishes sweet and leaves a smooth honey consistency on the palate. (3.75)

Compared to Pearl Street Lederhosen Lager 9/17/21: Pours an identical color. Similar aromas. Slightly more honey and lemonflower. Less orange and toasty/bready malts. Silghtly more pale, but more similar than I expected.

Overall: Quite a good Oktoberfest lager. Classic Surly Lemonflower hop and yeast flavors with sweet honey here. A more pale and traditional festbier, on par with the festbier style rather than Americanized Marzen. Almost drinks similar to a Dortmund Gold or Surly Hell on a bit of steroids. A fantastic beer here and I'm glad Surly went with a traditional festbier style this time. (Final Rating: 4.13)

Aroma is on the floral side, nicely malty.

On tasting though, it's more on the fruity side of things. Light hoppiness still present. Quite sweet as well. A little drying right at the end.

Mouth above medium, a little sharp. Finish a drying light bitterness.

Overall, pretty nice festbier. Would be interesting to try a fresher one to see if the usual Surly hop profile overwhelms. As it stands though, a tasty sessionable fall beer.",4.0
Oktoberfest,"Bought in one of two Binny's Pick Six, conveniently putting O-fests on three shelves for my easy preparation for the BA three week O-Fest thread. (Of which I made three entries and, generally, thought it worthwhile to study my O-Fest habit.)

Surly is a third generation crafter (basically, those that got their start in this century's first decade) that specializes in using hops, too many for my malt-head mouth. So I am not surprised that Surly's marzen is, well, hoppy for this malty style. Probably only in its third release, I'd hope (but don't expect) its fourth release will use hops to achieve balance instead of prominence.",3.75

Ends on a lightly dry note, a bready finish. Just enough malty flavors meets just enough easy-drinking to keep the celebration going.

Do I like it better than the beer it replaced, SurlyFest, which was not in the least a traditional märzen? No. SurlyFest was too unique and special not to love.

Neutral taste with low bitterness, toasted malt shines. Apple, attempting to be sweet is the only taste other than malt and faint hops. Cracker and toasted malt stand out over bread and dough. The finish is quick, crisp and clean and on the dry side. Bitterness builds to average during the lingering aftertaste.

Medium light bodied and perfectly carbonated. Alcohol is very well hidden. Smooth and session-able, balanced and true to style. Not as dark and sweet as Beers labeled Marzens, not as hoppy as many Festbier. Right in the middle.",3.75

Single Fermented Belgian Golden Ale,"Poured from an unfortunately undated 16oz can

On the pour, this is a beautiful golden ale. Super fine but active carbonation with a huge head that has great structure. It stays rocky and fine for a real long time. Some light lacing forms.

Aroma is basically a weaker version of a big belgian blond with some light spicy and even lighter fruity notes, but there is a nice bright citrusy lemony note. Behind the lemon is a nice sweet herbal smell that's likely a mix of hops and fermentation.

Taste is very nice. More drinkable than traditional duvel but still quite flavorful. Very bright and lemony, but then a nice biscuity maltiness comes in and balances everything very nicely. There is a slight hit of hop bitterness but it fades pretty quick but still does some nice work in making this crisp. This is a pretty sweet beer without the bottle conditioning.

Feel is relatively dry and effervescent. The finish is long and the malt is mouthcoating, but not overwhelming. Surprisingly crisp but also big. This is a pretty dang good year round anytime but session time beer.

Overall I enjoyed this quite a bit. More refreshing and malty than traditional duvel, but not lacking flavor in the slightest. Super beautiful through and through, and everything about this is enjoyable.",4.25

Single Fermented Belgian Golden Ale,"16oz can

Looks great, completely clear and bubbly: movie beer. It smells like it tastes, crisp and clean and yeasty, just a little fruit: lemon green apple banana, slight spice and a little bit of some lemony bitter hops; kind of disappointed on the hop taste considering the side of the can boasts about the citra hops they used - it barely comes across and has a slick feeling kinda rancid sweetness that comes across better in the scent. More slick and syrupy as it warms, should be drier. Drink it fast. Expensive as all heck, I tell ya hwhat

Single Fermented Belgian Golden Ale,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $4.50. There is a lot code on the bottom of the can, hard to tell if this is a Julian date or not. If so, 127 would correspond to a canning date of 5/6/20. Can also has a best by date of 1/26/21.

Look: Pours a beautiful golden color. No haze at all - completely clear. A nice white head upon the pour, reduced to a thin cling to the rim of the glass. Very tiny bubbles quickly rising to the surface.

Smell: Lots of Belgian yeast character in the nose - spicy/peppery, clovey, and nice lemony/grassy hop aroma. Underlying sweet biscuity malt aroma present also. Given that this is dry hopped with Citra, the citrus aroma is pretty reserved. The noble hop aroma is more dominant.

Taste: This is pretty refreshing, crisp, and dry. It's very drinkable and the 6.8% ABV is hardly noticeable. Up front, notes of clove from the Belgian yeast along with biscuity malt. The beer moves through the palate quickly with moderate carbonation and finishes with peppery spicy and slightly bitter and grassy Noble hop notes. Finish is very dry and crisp, refreshing. The Citra dry-hopping is not so prevalent in the taste to me. I'm getting some mild citrus notes reminiscent of lemon zest lingering on the finish, but I wouldn't mind if they were more agressive. They may also be subdued based on how fresh this beer is, which is hard to know.

Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively light to medium, yet full and appropriate for its weight. It works very well for this type of beer.

Overall: This is a solid Belgian Golden Ale. Given the freshness questions that I mentioned above, it's hard to say how much the Ctira dry-hopping is enhancing this beer. I think that it definitely works well, but personally I think that it is too subtle. I would like to try a fresher can.",4.0

Cold Torpedo,"Why not try two brown twelve ounce bottles at once? The best way to do this is to empty both bottles into a clear glass liter mug. Here's another one that provides a stark white foam, rather than a proper IPA head. OK, it's far from the worst offender. The brew itself is a light golden amber and it's fairly translucent. There's a mild piney and earthy hop aroma to be had and there's almost no maltiness. The taste is disappointing. Although it's not lopsidedly out of balance between malt and hops, overall it's just lame. From their beginning, Sierra Nevada has offered decidedly hoppy beers with a good malt backing, way before most other American brewers. This has neither. The body is thin and the hops are bland and one dimensional. There's absolutely no hop taste transition that usually occurs in a good IPA. Those usually change from some sort of taste reference that is citrus, pine or fruit, into something either dry or bitter. It doesn't happen here. In a blind taste, this would be below average. Knowing that it came from this brewery, it's demoralizing. Mild demarcation by an otherwise scanty glass lacing can't salvage this one.",3.75

Cold Torpedo,"Another beautiful looking Sierra Nevada beer, SN is very good or better at bring the public amazing looking beers and rightfully so. For the most part their beers are above the industry standard and I have enjoyed their beers for many years now. Having said that, this Cold Torpedo beer does NOT live up to their reputation. The appearance once again is very well done, although the aroma of hops is present is is very weak and seems one dimensional and that follows through with the taste, I very much wish it had been much stronger as the taste/aroma of regular Torpedo brings across. Granted, with all the competition and styles and etc., etc. going on in the market today breweries are trying this that and the other thing to increase or even maintain their piece of the pie, this beer fails to meet SN's standards, but I did drink it all while typing this so its not a bad beer by any stretch, just not up to SN's standards.",3.75

The oily mouthfeel is much more robust than the aroma or appearance would indicate. Full bodied and rich, pleasantly carbonated.

Tastes of pine, honey, incredibly pleasant floral bouquet, oranges with a teeny bit of pineapple.

Aroma is clean and spicy/peppery with some subtle tropical fruit notes. Expands a bit with warming.

Taste is lightly bready with a touch of fruit and finishes with a flash of bitterness which also expands a bit with warming. Overall the jury is still out. My first Cold IPA and not sure where it fits in my universe. Agree with others that the use of the word Torpedo is a bit misleading, beer vs. machine. Still, an easy quaff at 7 percent.",3.5
Cold Torpedo,"From the Sierra Nevada blog: ""We brew our Cold IPA using lager yeast, fermented warmer than usual, to give Cold Torpedo its light and clean backbone. That temperature bump helps reduce the sulfur-like notes that lager yeast can create when kept at its normal range of 42–55 ºF."" I guess this temperature bump is the argument to give this style it's own name, but this is not an ale! I would call this an India Pale Lager, which I am a big fan of.

This 12 oz bottle was from a 12 pack mix I picked up at the grocery store and is dated 06/03/22, then consumed on 08/17/22. I have to rate the look lower because they are labeling this as an ale when it's actually a lager, but it has that traditional golden color a lager would have. The smell is fairly mild, a subtle but funky piney aroma. The taste has a light malt flavor, followed by a well balanced bitter aftertaste. The feel is crisp and light, good level of carbonation.

Overall, I actually love this beer, but I hate the name. This is a biased review because I am a fan of hoppy lagers and Sierra Nevada, but I am disappointed in the name choice. It doesn't taste anything like their Torpedo Extra IPA, or any ale for that matter. Probably a bad marketing decision, but at least it tastes good!",4.25

Pour: Golden clear with a touch of haze but not enough to hinder seeing through the beer. Beautiful white head of foam.

Smell: Like a fruit filled garden that a semi truck full of hops just crashed into. Its beautiful with a hint of lager? Loving it.

Taste: When that hop filled truck crashed crushing that fruit garden the juices ran into a bottle. That bottle was poured into this beer during brewing. Its so drinkable that it would surprise the most snobbiest of beer drinkers.

A+ love it!",4.25
Cold Torpedo,"A very good beer but a little dishonest with the marketing. If you look at the Sierra Nevada website you can clearly tell that this beer is not an IPA. In fact this beer is not even an ale. It is fermented with lager yeast. It tastes like an IPL or a stronger pilsner. Delicious hoppy flavors and a crisp refreshing lager feel/body. I guess they wanted to capitalize on the allure of the ""IPA"" marketing label. This beer is 100% hoppy lager and I love it.",5.0
Cold Torpedo,"COld 12 oz. bottle poured into stange glass. dated from june, so pretty fresh by local (sub)standards. Looks nice, light golden and fairly clear, with a nice white head that has longevity. Aroma is faint but pleasant. My sniffer is toasted from nose hits. Taste is very good. Very nicely balanced, lager-like ale that is hiding the 7%abv, and very drinkable. Nice clean and dry finish. One of the best ""new"" ipa's lately. Just grabbed the hoppy mix box of 12 ipa's because of the good deal on it, and it's always a safe bet when trying a new Sierra Nevada. Even if you don't like it, you know it was well made. I think this could convert my lager only friends into ipa territory. Recommended",4.25
Cold Torpedo,"Went ahead and bought the variety 12 pack, because hey, 3 of the beers in there are the greatest ale of all time. Easy to take a chance on a new beer when they package it up with the gold standard (SNPA).

This pours noticeably lighter colored SRM than OG Torpedo. This is straight up yellow. 1/2"" white head. Not the best clarity I've seen from Sierra Nevada (below average for them). The hops seem to be similar to regulare Torpedo, that is, for bittering. I think they stuck w the hop bill, something Magnum, maybe Simcoe and C hop(s).

The taste is basically a less malty, less caramel like Torpedo. It does have a crisper snap to the mouth feel. Ample bitterness. Lots of pine if you have never had Torpedo. Some grapefruit rind.",3.75
Cold Torpedo,"PKGD: 4/20/22 opened and reviewed on 7/13/22

Look: A totally clear.. (did I just say clear??) Gold color. Light, white foam cap covers well and sticks around a bit too.

Nose: slight pine and pineapple, zingy citrus and sweet, spicy golden malt. Subtle, yet interesting aromatics.

Feel & Flavor: A long and slick malty feel, pretty clean overall with an excellent straight ale flavor to balance out the zesty fruits and tanginess of the frigid fermentation. Zesty pineapple and peppery citrus notes are only outshined by the malt complexity.

Overall: I really like IPA'S that have a solid and clean malty backbone, especially when it's a golden malt. The ""Ale"" forward flavor's make it seriously drinkable for 7% and the hops are mid-level complexity at best but still stands as interesting.",3.75
Cold Torpedo,"The beer pours to a hazy golden color with a long-lasting head. Aroma is of fruits and pine. Slight tangy taste immediately fades to a clean tasteless finish, leaving only a faint taste of hops behind. A clean and crisp beer that delivers a unique IPA experience.",4.0
Cold Torpedo,"Picked up a single from the Mills River Gift Shop 5-26-22 for $1.75. Packaged 4-20-22; consumed 7-2-22.

Beer poured a clear gold with a beautiful white head that is leaving lacing behind.

Nose is floral hop forward.

Taste is a nice bready malt base infused with a light touch of Cascade giving a touch of citrus finishing with nice peppery hop bite leading to a crisp smooth and bitter finish; 7/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and refreshing.

Overall a nice effort from the brewing team, like the lager like vibe!",4.0
Cold Torpedo,"From the rear label: ""PKGD 03/31/22""

Appearance: The body is a medium gold color with a medium haze, making it difficult to see through the glass but items are clearly identified. The head is short, white, and creamy textured. It has good head retention and leaves nice sheets of dense bubbles on the glass.

Aroma: There is a light minty pine aroma that comes through at first, then a light bit of alcohol.

Taste: Pine hits the tongue first, then it picks up a touch of mint with a light candy sweetness. There is a bitter pine and a touch of grapefruit peel towards the middle of the mouth. It doesn't change towards the back of the palate or in the aftertaste. Mostly it has a minty pine character which is nice but also mellow.

Mouthfeel: It is very smooth with an almost slick consistency. It has a nice bitterness which is on the stronger side. It lingers on the palate with a smooth finish.

Overall: It is an interesting beer. The back label states that this ""DELIVERS THE FRUIT-FORWARD HOP RUSH YOU'RE AFTER"" however it seems more pine and mint focused, with only a touch of grapefruit. It also states that this ""FINISHES ULTRA CRISP AND CLEAN"" which it does not. It sticks to the palate and lingers. The beer is still good and I would recommend that people try it if they enjoy a lot of pine in their IPA's, but it seems to miss the brewer's intent. It is fairly one-note and has this smooth slickness which just feels odd when compared to the relatively high bitterness. I could still drink it again but I would probably buy regular Torpedo if given the choice.",3.5
Cold Torpedo,"12 ounce bottle poured in a tulip IPA glass.

Translucent gold color, no haze except for the condensation on the outside of the glass. White soapy cap, 1f, sticky lacing.

Classic ale aromas of fresh dough, light caramel and a little diacetyl. Some mild citrus, berry, and melon.

Caramel malt and citrus hop flavors. Orange, grapefruit peel, and herbal.

Medium bodied with a nice mix of malt smoothness and hop bitterness. Dry finish line.

It goes down easy. Its 7% abv is covered up. The hop flavors are mild, yet it’s bitter.",4.25
Cold Torpedo,"Bottled 04/08/22

Appearance - Pours with a light haze and is golden orange in color. White, half finger width head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving behind a thin, broken layer of suds with a thin, consistent ring hugging the edge of the glass. Sparse lacing, with a handful of small spots making a virtual sad face.

Smell - Floral hops and a juicy citrus aroma really stand out.

Taste - Follows the nose. Bright citrus, orange and tangerine, and floral hoppiness take the stage here, with a bready malt backbone and a kiss of caramel sweetness. Touch of grapefruit mid-taste. Finish displays a trace of pine and light citrus pith bitterness.

Mouthfeel - Light-to-medium in body with fair carbonation. Slick, smooth drinker before a lightly dry finish.

Overall - Really solid brew. Easier drinking than the standard Torpedo but hopheads would probably prefer the former. It's lighter, brighter profile certainly makes for a friendlier summer drinker. I would by more of this if it came in it's own sixer instead of only being able to get it in their 12 pack mixer.",4.0
Cold Torpedo,Slightly hazy appearance. Flavor is a little more fruit-forward and not as bitter as their standard Torpedo.,3.75

Multiple Ectogasms,"Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (5% clarity) light and pale yellow color with a creamy looking body. A strong, creamy white head. SRM of 6. (4.50)

Aroma: Strong and dank aromas of tropical melon, berries, some nectarine with a dank foresty malt underneath. Slightly sweet aromas.

Flavor: Strong dank and juicy flavors of tangerine, dank berries, melon. Blackberries, blueberries. Some phenolic notes. A sweet finish. Dank, and somewhat bitter pine off the finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Finish is crisp and somewhat bitter.

Compared to Modist Midwest Mindset 8/29/22: Pours a lighter, hazier color. Milder aromas. More dank berry, melon, tangerine. Less citrus rind, flower, herbs, mango, pineapple. Sweeter, danker, and more hop burn.

Overall: Certainly showcases the DDH Mosaic here. Dank berries and melon. Some appreciable bitterness here, whether from the hops or the hop burn I am not sure. Sort of cleans the palate of the sweetness. A bit too bitter and hop burn for my liking, but the appearance is there and the body wants to be there, but consumed by hop burn and/or bitterness. (Rating: 4.07)",4.0
Multiple Ectogasms,"A: The beer is very hazy yellow in color - too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that quickly settled down, leaving just a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of lime citrus and gooseberry are present in the nose along with notes of lychee and hints of mango.
T: The taste has flavors of lime and lychee along with notes of mango. Little to no bitterness is perceptible.

Multiple Ectogasms,"So got this in a craft variety pack for the holidays and cracked into this North Dakota NEIPA. Being a New Englander, I have high expectations for this style but the beer definitely is solid. Classic NEIPA tropical haze and thickness, with a slight head that fades. Smells a little funky and not sure why but tastes super tropical and pulpy like an OJ. Not bad from Fargo, ND, but I’ll stick to Vermont and the rest of New England.",3.75
Multiple Ectogasms,"Really enjoyed ectogasm and was excited to try this one, but found it to be a step too far. Starting with the feel, where the orignal was pillowy, smooth yet had a good hope finish, this one is broken up by the imbalance with the hops, making the body feel watery with jagged hop textures as the only diversity. This undermines the taste with the flavors besides hop bitterness, citrus pith and lemon being taken out of the equation almost immediately, but the hops are flavorful and full. Nose is all hops, airy and bitter with huge citrus and lighter melon tones. Looks great though, hazy bright yellow with a full white head and light lacing. Balance is just off here",3.75
Multiple Ectogasms,"Hazy lighter golden almost milkshake like look with a thin white head, this brew looks quite nice. An immediate almost orange juice like scent just jumps out of this can when cracked. Juicy and well balanced with a gentle lingering grapefruit juice like bitterness on the end. Slight alcohol felt on this one. On the thinner side of medium in feel. Nice beer here.",4.25
Multiple Ectogasms,Pours a standard mimosa color with a smaller white head that dissipates after a minute. It smells like sweet orange peels and slightly tropical pineapple notes with a hint of mango and pine on the finish. The taste has a candied orange peel flavor up front and has a sweet tropical middle and a slightly sweeter piney mango finish. This one is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had and it's a genuine pleasure to drink. Overall very good.,4.0
Multiple Ectogasms,"Pours a hazy light orange with fine, soapy head.

Smell is juicy and very hoppy with notes of grass, mango, pineapple and peach.

Multiple Ectogasms,"16 oz can, was swayed by the salesman on this one.

Pours a milky smooth creamy pale blonde with a creamy head of 2 fingers, leaving tons of lace behind as it recedes to a thick ring.

In the aroma, Citra and Mosaic come forward with gooseberries and some slight cattiness. Some damp dirty laundry accompanies this somewhat, detracting from some of the cleaner hop aromas.

Flavor is not impressive at all and brings Arm & Hammer, grapefruit, lemon peel, soap, and slight popsickle stick. I checked the can again, and it does indeed say it's double-dry-hopped. Yet it tastes like some half-assed session beer. There is absolutely no way this is 7%. It's practically water.

Feel is juicy and creamy and acidic, on point. Good carbonation, moderate alcohol presence. But none of this matters because the flavor profile is non-existent.

Overall, no lie, this had to be the worst - or at least most boring - Citra/Mosaic IPA I've ever had. Did they brew this beer, cut it in half with carbonated water, and THEN release it?

Either I'm getting the turd out of every 4 pack or other people are smoking crack. Seriously - Drekker sucks, after half a dozen beers from them I have not found a single one worth finishing. This was laundry water. Expensive laundry water.

Big aroma of dank, catty, tropical fruit, citrus fruit, and vegetal hops.
First flavor is citrus orange and mango, with the backend being more dank, resiny, grapefruit rind, and vegetal. Kind of dry, and taste dyes off rather quickly. High level of hop product, that leads to a slight throat burn, but there is no bitterness.

Oktoberfest Weissbier,"0.33 L bottle
Best By: April, 2022
Glassware: 0.5 L Weizen Vase
Temp at Pour: mid 40s F


Look:
Golden yellow that is hazy and somewhat opaque (I can see the shadows of my fingers through the glass). Initial 2-finger pillowy off-white head that fades quickly to a thick ring and inconsistent cover. A bit underwhelming for a Hefeweizen.

Smell:
Bananas and bubblegum with some citrus notes. Grainy wheat malt. Minimal spices

Taste:
Ripe bananas and sweet citrus notes with very noticeable wheat grains. Cloves and allspice come through towards the end along with some flowery notes. As the beer warms some tartness becomes evident.

Feel:
Smooth and somewhat creamy. Body leans to the lighter side of medium.

Overall:
An interesting beer. This is a grainer variant of a Hefeweizen that has a higher ABV than most others and more inline with Oktoberfest beers. Though unspectacular, it is inoffensive and hits the classic Hefeweizen notes. It is eminently drinkable. It would be a find beer to introduce someone to the Hefeweizen styles.",3.5
Oktoberfest Weissbier,"Gem clear and gold until the yeast floods in. A big, voluminous, white meringue fills the bulb of a Pretentious Glass Company weizen glass. The head slowly settles to a thin blanket, leaving spotty lace beyond a spool of hair-thin glass.

The aroma has a nice, doughy/banana bread quality. It does, however, become muddy, with dusty straw as the head settles. Warmth reveals the expected clove.

It is sweet, front to back, with faint bitterness building into and through the finish. The banana flavor is very muted, though present. This is definitely a wheat beer, however, I suspect it was not as fresh as I had hoped. The bottle says ""Best By April 2022"". I drank it in November of 2021.

The medium body and soft, Jersey cotton texture give it a fluffy sensation. Alcohol is light, as expected, however, the carbonation should not be light and fizzy as it is here.

This is a decent drinking beer, even if this bottle is a bit too aged. It would work well in the early evening, or just with light conversation.",3.75

The aroma was yeast and cloves and spices. Quite nice.
The taste was better than I expected as I tend to not like wheat beers much but the spices and nutty flavors blended nicely with the bitterness for an enjoyable drink, I was definitely disappointed when it ended.

Oktoberfest Weissbier,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a hazed orange color with a one finger head of puffy white foam. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big of a grainy and wheaty smell mixed with lots of orange and banana and spice of clove. Along with these smells comes a bit of toast and hay. Overall, very nice.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweeter wheaty and grainy taste with the sweeter being mostly of an orange and caramel taste. As the taste advances flavors of clove and coriander spice as well as banana comes to the flavor profile. At the same time a touch of herb and grass hit the tastebuds, all while a yeasty flavor comes in and some of the grain leaves, leaving one with a nice, somewhat sweeter but very pleasant weisbier flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is slightly higher. Overall, the feel is great for the style and makes for a very nice easy drinker.
Overall – A rather nice weisbier with a great flavor and a great drinkability.",4.25
Oktoberfest Weissbier,"12 oz bottle, poured into a nucleated teku at ~40 degrees F.

L: Pours an opaque burnished-straw gold, and forms a massively fluffy head of white foam with ridiculous retention and lacing.

S: Banana and bubblegum, wafting on the breeze along a wheaten plain. A tinge of spice, and a hint of breadiness to the banana.

T: Definitely a hefeweizen. Clove, banana, and bubblegum hit right up front, and roll into the background by the finish to allow a biscuitlike bready quality to come forward.

F: Creamy and full, though with a bit of a lighter breakdown by the swallow.

O: Not a bad weissbier.",4.0
Oktoberfest Weissbier,"A wheat version of an Octoberfest style. Appearance is a golden cloudy color with banana, clove, taste. I find this more of a Hefeweizen than an Octoberfest and that is why it is categorized as a Hefeweizen, instead of an Octoberfest beer.",3.75
Oktoberfest Weissbier,"A- This pours out of the bottle, which I may say has great artwork and color, a cloudy golden hue, but only after some careful swirling of the 'nutrients' at the bottom of the bottle with a bit of the liquid, otherwise this would be a light yellowy golden color that is rather clear! The carbonation seems to be fairly aggressive in nature, and the head is white, and shows up as a small circular glob right in the middle of the glass at the top of the brew, with many columns of fizz bursting around it. There is modest lacing that graces the inside of my glass, but over time becomes more of an oily looking residue that doesn't stick at all. Overall this does have some characteristics of a Hefe, and looks decent enough.

S- The aromas are of medium banana bread, cloves, nutmeg, yeast, and sweet caramel malts. There are perhaps some muted grassy grainy wheat aromas, but definitely stay put in the background. I also detect some, again, muted hints of hop presence. Overall the smell is mild, which for a Hefe is probably not ideal, but for an Oktoberfest style, is great.....a blend of both styles here.....

T- Much of the aforementioned aromas carry over into the flavors. Muted banana, baking spices (clove and nutmeg), creamy yeast, bread and/or biscuit, and a dry finish that is of grain/wheat kernel. I find that the overall malt profile is fairly robust, and is noticeable from start to finish. I find that it is also reasonably clean on the finish. I like it!

M/O- As my eyes suggested, this one is definitely heavily carbonated, which is what I like to enjoy for an Oktoberfest. The body is medium and I find it to be highly drinkable (it helped that I found these 5 packs that came with a sweet glass for $13.99!) Think this does well with a meat pizza, as I had with this, as it cuts the oily pepperoni well, and it works well as a palate cleanser. An overall mild Hefe that doubles as a flavorful Oktoberfest....I can enjoy more than a pint in a sitting and see this as a great hot weather refresher!",4.0

Thundertaker,"On tap at Revolution Brewpub

Man, I did not realize how highly regarded this one was when I order it. Not quite in the BA top 250, but sitting close under at #372 at the moment, and #97 for the style. Let’s find out if this no frills approach works out for Revolution

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of creamy light tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is very sweet and boozy in the nose. I don’t know why, but I was expecting something with more bite. Still, I like it. I’m picking up on aromas of toasted coconut, sweet vanilla, oak, chocolate fudge, molasses, brown sugar, light raisin, marzipan, and light rye

Likewise in taste it is quite sweet, without much punch to keep it truly balanced. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, honey, spicy rye, caramel, light coconut, black cherry, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, molasses, spicy rye, sweet bourbon, caramel, toasted coconut, oak, and milk chocolate

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a boozy sweet beer. Finishes neutral with a bold sweetness

From the Revolution Stouts I’ve had, I’ve noticed that many lean more into Barleywine territory. I don’t mind that, but in this one it’s perhaps a bit too sweet. Still, it’s enjoyable other than the feel being hurt a bit",4.0

Phenomenal, just like batch one when fresh. Dark brown appearance with a good bit of foam forming upon aggressive pour. Smells and taste of plenty of chocolate, sweet bourbon and rice spices.

Thundertaker is a stout to be dissected; it’s like a beer layer cake. And it took a good 45 minutes to open up. I initially thought this was kind of dull. It’s not. Rye finally rises & the bourbon settles in right between my eyes. Behind is chocolate, loads of sweet molasses, brazen spiciness that leans towards mélange, with a touch of brown leather on the finish. Thick & spicy. I am going to hide the other can from my wife.

Thundertaker,"Canned on 9/10/2020; consumed on 8/18/21

Pours a glossy, inky black body capped with over two fingers of soapy, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a quickly fading cap, a razor-thin, frothy collar, and no lacing whatsoever holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings rye spice to the forefront as the malt profile expands upon big, fudgy chocolate tones into shaved almonds with a bourbon imbued epicenter imparting an undercurrent of oak and vanilla, while culminating in a chocolate pudding toast crescendo through the close.

Taste opens with burnt brownie crust as spikes of spicy rye malt form caramel brittle and vanilla-tinged fudge into the mid-palate, where decadent layers of melted dark chocolate and tinges of molasses being sensations of chocolate pudding crusts, while subtle bourbon and oak coat the increasingly decadent malt finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body with minimal carbonation, slick, semi-creamy textures evolving and glistening over the mid-palate to deliver a prickly warmth; trending toward a stickier characteristic which never quite materializes, instead highlighting a softer char into a subtle dryness on the back end.

Rich expression of malt decadence blatantly attempts to compensate for the immediate affront of rye spice, seeking a tenuous balance, occasional clashing, and ultimately settling well to satisfy both the sweeter tooth and barrel-forward leanings.",4.0
Thundertaker,"12 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 9/10/20, had 12/3/20.

Pours an opaque dark brown, thick looking, with a brief quarter inch head and light foamy lacing. Aromas of bourbon, rye, chocolate, malt, tobacco, oak, some char, molasses, some vanilla as it warms, light raisins and leather. Smells fantastic. The flavor is more bourbon forward and wow, is it good. Then rye, chocolate, malt, oak, tobacco, raisins, vanilla as it warms, light molasses, a little char. Has a definite spicy flavor. Tastes about as good as it smells. Silky smooth, a solid full body, well carbonated.

This is my favorite stout of the Deep Wood series, no doubt. Incredible barrels, a heavenly aroma, a cornucopia of aromas and flavors. The rye malt is a knockout, too. That extra five months in the barrel from the original planned release certainly did no harm. Revolution just continues to amaze.",4.75
Thundertaker,"Poured from a can, the beer pours the expected blackish brown color. Head retention and lacing aren't this beer's strong suit, but even so, the beer looks quite rich and viscous. When I first tasted this beer (fresh out of the fridge), I wasn't hugely impressed, as I picked up an overwhelming amount of molasses on the nose and palate. However, as the beer warmed and opened up, there was noticeable dark chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla, light coffee and some light bourbon/rye whiskey. The flavor profile replicated the nose pretty closely in this rich, fairly sweet stout, with the beer displaying a soft, creamy, full mouthfeel. Not that it matters I think, but while I did pick up some rye on the nose, there wasn't much of that on the palate. Either way, I don't think the rye flavor adds a whole lot to this beer. Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell the alcohol is up there a bit (I mean after all, the abv IS 14.6%). So this is definitely a sipper (I think I spent close to 3 hours savoring this beer, watching 3 episodes of star trek voyager).

This is the first beer I've had from this brewery, and to say the least I was quite impressed. This is very well done.",4.5
Thundertaker,"Deep near-obsidian almost-black. Oily. Small head fizzes up fizzes down and is gone.

Nose is more subdued than I'd expect, to be honest. Dark roasted malts, burnt coffee, dark dark chocolate... boozy, but not as much as you'd expect given it's massive ABV. Enjoyable flavours, but relatively muted.

Oily and spicy with spicy carbonation. Warm alcohol finish. Again, definitely very very boozy, but not as much so as 14.6% might suggest.

Sweet first off. Rich and oily. Dark plum, fudgy dark dark chocolate brownies, some espresso bitterness to go with the chocolate bitterness. Sweet, oily, rich, decadent. Less of the hard spicy rye than I got on the nose.

Another decadent IL-area stout from @FBarber's box of goodies. Thanks Frank!",4.0
Thundertaker,"This was fantastic from beginning to end. Look was above average, smell was above average with lots of bourbon, but the taste was where the magic really happened. I got lots of barrel char in this to accompany the rye spice, deeply layered malts, and sweet bourbon finish. Smooth as silk with a touch of alcohol burn.",4.5
Thundertaker,"Obsidian black with a short dark mocha head that fizzles out fairly quickly to a thin brown caviar chain, leaving a surface that appears somewhat oily and gloppy. A tilt will develop solid legs fully sweeping around the perimeter of the glass.

Delectable aromas of charred oak and dark chocolate give way to hints of toasted marshmallow and fainter hints of hickory smoked almond.

While a little lighter up front, first taste is fudge cut by a light sting of peppery bourbon and savory charred oak. It then thickens and smooths mid-palate to a more viscous consistency where a prickly carbonation arises before the semi-dry, lightly sticky swallow brings up a touch of heat.

Caramel glides in on the second sip, as do lighter notes of root beer and roasted nuts. Even though it thickens mid-palate, it honestly goes down so quickly as it transitions to a cola feel towards the swallow that it's hard to contemplate, but after one sip I'm exhaling char and fudge for days.

It's not QUITE as good as BCBS, but it's close. As I say this, I think to compare my ratings, and it's even closer than I expected, being only .01 off!",4.5
Thundertaker,"Pours a deep black with minimal head and no lacing.

The smell is very sweet dark fruits, char, whiskey, maple, and vanilla.

Thundertaker,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like molasses, rye candy, dark bittersweet maple syrup, oak spice, tobacco, heavy roast, cocoa powder, and vanilla.

This is easily one of the best just straight up barrel aged stouts that I've ever had. So much interesting and complex flavor is wrung from the barrel aging process here. There's a killer and intriguing sweetness here - mainly feels like maple and molasses, with some sweet powdery chocolate, and vanilla as well. There's also spicy and heavy oak character, with a wonderful bourbon heat to it. The cool sweetness from the beer might come from the barrel, might come from the malt. The rye spice with the sweetness is just great.

This is medium bodied, creamy, and with no real booziness to it. There's some warmth, but no outward astringency. It's very drinkable.

This is just a perfect example of an amazing beer being made especially for an amazing barrel. Revolution should be extremely proud of this effort.",4.75
Thundertaker,"Pitch black body with a finger of brown foam. Aromas of semi-sweet chocolate backed up by rich and dark bourbon, oak, rye, char, earth, tobacco, molasses, and raisin. Taste is much the same, a touch of leather here and there, but less of the dark fruit flavors, booze is showcased in a powerful yet balanced way. Feel is warm, smooth, chewy, thick, and heavy with the barrel character really showing itself. Best rye ba stout of the year so far! The wife loved it",4.75

Okto Festival Ale,"Appearance: Pours a mostly clear, medium, deep orange color with a mild off-white head. SRM of 11. (3.75)

Aroma: Relatively moderate aromas of bread malt, crusty cereal malt. Some caramel evolves as it warms, but largely pale.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of bread malt and pale malt. Strong bready flavors and a smooth malty finish. Some deeper caramel evolves from the bread as it warms. Not too sweet.

Feel: Medium to heavier bodied. Properly carbonated and a full mouthfeel and bread malt lingers off the finish.

Overall: A pretty decent Marzen here. Very bready. Not spiced or amber malt from an altbier like I would expect. I would describe this as a bready Marzen. Relatively pale, but a strong bready flavor and nice mouthfeel. Not too sweet and full. It's not bad as bad as the ratings suggest. Bready and enjoyable. (Rating: 3.83)",4.0

Mouthfeel:
Light. Low-ish CO2, no astringency or harsh MF

It pours a hazy copper with a thin white head. Sweet malt aroma is clear as day. The sweetness is not as immediately present on the taste. Initially, I had a metallic flavor before it settles into the sweetness I smelled. Most of the mouthfeel is inoffensive. It's not bad, but I wouldn't put this in a marketed Oktoberfest pack.",3.5
Okto Festival Ale,"12oz can

Pours two fingers of tan head into my can-style glass. Retention is average and the head mostly fades within a few minutes. Lacing is pretty good. Body is a dark burnt orange, high clarity, with a moderate amount of bubbles coming up. Looks pretty nice.

Nose is biscuity, with some faint fruity esters, slightly sweet. Not a super big nose, but it smells pretty decent.

Flavor is ok, a little malty, some biscuit. Fruity esters do start to show up as the beer warms, but overall the aroma has a hard time coming through to the flavor.

Carbonation is on the lighter side, I agitated it a decent amount though. Body is medium. Just slightly bitter. Touch of sweetness, well attenuated though. Pretty straight forward mouthfeel.

Drinkability is very nice.

Definitely seems more like a Marzen than a Altbier, like some past versions have been apparently marketed. Overall not terrible, probably better than the rep it gets. Still, the flavor certainly leaves a little to be desired, not a whole lot going on there.",3.5

Okto Festival Ale,"My first beer in Support of New Beer Sunday (Week 573) will be another from the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody. I am actually starting to make real, noticeable progress; bottles are getting recycled; caps are being saved for art projects; 4- & 6-pack carriers are being emptied & returned. It is a glorious time!

From the bottle: ""Loosen your lederhosen. Our full-bodied Okto Festival Ale is inspired by Bavarian Oktoberfest. [undersigned] Kurt [&] Rob""; ""We pay fitting tribute with its distinctive malt flavors, mild floral character and crisp, clean finish. Prost! to the land of Prost!""

A Pop! of the cap & the Festival was underway! I utilized a gentle pour in deference to its relative age and then gave it a vigorous swirl in the glass. This produced a finger of foamy, tawny head with decent retention that slowly fell to wisps. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was oddly vegetal, like cooked cabbage, underlain by a biscuit maltiness. I read the style description for an Altbier, but even with the style's quirks and oddities, this does not seem right. Mouthfeel was medium to-full, not quite creamy. The taste was MUCH better than the nose had led me to expect! It was actually quite sweet, very much of caramel or crème brulee. Again, I am not sure that such is stylistically correct, nor would I ever mistake this for an Oktoberfest/Marzen. The sweetness made it more like a dessert beer for me. It was drinkable, certainly, and the finish was only semi-sweet, perhaps as a testament to the yeast having thoroughly done its job. The caramel flavor lingered well after the finish. For me, one was plenty.",3.25

Appearance- Pours a dark copper orange with a two finger head of a faintly brown tint, quick to dissipate. Moderatly hazy.

Smell- Caramel, baked bread, orange citrus.

Taste- Toasty malt, semi sweet. Chewy nut flavor mixes in with a subtle citric hop flavor of orange coming through as well. Finish is sharp and comes on fast, finishing more malty than hoppy by far.

Mouthfeel- Medium in body with medium carbonation as well. Smooth.

Overall- Kind of like an Oktoberfest but not really as this is an Altbier. Definitely mixes up the Fall seasonal thing. Not a sweet malts and a very crisp clean flavor profile. Well suited for the season.",4.0

Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"From a can into a pint glass. Pour has a vibrant, slowly receding head of light biege foam that tops a fantastic amber brown body that is generally clear but with uniform particulate throughout. Scent has the pretty typical nuttiness of a brown ale with sweeter notes of toffee and hazelnut rounding it out (and almost wholly avoiding the sometimes bitter scents of a brown ale). Taste is an incredibly well balanced blend of subtle nuttiness and hazelnut with a just a smidge of bitterness peeking out. Feel is very smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that follows the taste well. An all around excellent fall beer that is very, very drinkable.",4.0
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"This one I really like.

Poured a deep reddish auburn with a tan head that didn't last that long, but overall it still looked good in the glass.

Aroma and taste lived up to the hazelnut hype, and even the nectar part, as the feel was a bit thick and went down with a great deal of satisfaction.

This one had a nice complexity between hops, malt and hazelnut. I will absolutely buy it again. It was also nice to have an English brown ale, as this style is not very common in South tx",4.25
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"First, this is a well carbonated beverage. But it doesn't produce a ridiculous amount of beer head. In fact, the lightly biege head is very modest, although somewhat enduring. The brew itself is a solid brown color that's opaque, but far from murky. The aroma is malty and the described hazelnut addition is definitely subdued. That aspect isn't even in the initial taste. But then, as the brew lingers toward its finish, the hazelnut explodes. This is a truly unique drinking experience and a good one, should you like hazelnuts. As a brown ale there's no expectation of hoppiness and this is true to that style. That this can convert a mild malt character into one with such a hazelnut infusion is admirable. This may be another limited audience brew, but it's a great choice for anyone that likes their brown ales with a hazelnut flavoring. This best part, it adds a nutty aspect without any additional sweetness.",4.5

The body is light/medium and very smooth with mild carbonation.
Overall, just a really pleasant brown ale, very nice.",4.25
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"Nutty: my favorite.

L- On the pour I got a 1finger head, as I drink there is light lacing. It is a deep reddish brown and the beer is almost hazy which is interesting, hopefully normal, but kinda cool.

S- the hazelnut flavor definitely comes through and it compliments the yeast they used nicely. Not a lot of hops on the nose, but that's kinda the point.

T- A warm (feeling/tasting) malty tidal wave of flavor dissipates into a pretty subtle hazelnut flavor with very light bitterness that also reminds me of a nut, not a lot of hops again.

F- the feel is mostly consistent and overall enjoyable but if you think about it there is a slick lens that comes right before a dryness but that's quite easy to move past

O- the flavor profile carrys this beer into nut brown ale stardom, as the hops from american craft brewing remove some of the nutty qualities from this english style. Sam smith still beats them out, but this is much more accessible and attractive to modern audiences.",4.5

Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"Of all things, picked up a bottle of this delicious nectar at a liquor store in Clovis NM (hilltop liquor store).

The beer pours the expected blackish brown color, with very good head retention and lacing. The nose is fairly typical for a Firestone anniversary ale, showcasing considerable brown sugar, vanilla, light molasses, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee and light bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this rich, moderately sweet beer. The cacaphony of different flavors blend together very, very well in this rather luscious beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is long, soft, creamy and rather decadent. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell the abv is up there a bit. Drinkability is pretty good considering, and this beer makes an absolutely delightful after dinner aperitif.

It doesn't feel complex so much as very easy to drink; probably dangerously so if I wasn't planning on remaining relatively stationary.

Firestone Walker XXV enters the lower echelon of a fabled line of anniversary brews. Impressions I’ve had of this beer are confirmed: it’s thin & muddled. For all the marvelous beers dunked herein, what results is light barrel, mostly brandy, faint chocolate, light tequila (growing as it warms), leather, & a finish of oak.

Dark brown color with tan head. Not much of that, though, so not much lacing.

Sticky dark fruit on the nose, and there's a savory depth to it. A little raisin, a little prune, and a little fig. There's also some creamer/lactic scent going on, as well as vanilla and clove. Very pleasant.

It's even heavier on the fruit in the taste, and I'd especially say the raisin is dialed up. Distinct sweetness, although it's not overpowering. The next main flavor is coffee, and it goes along with moderate-light bitterness. The sweetness seems to link to brown sugar late.

Weight is heavy; it sits on the back of my tongue. Carbonation is fine and well integrated. Alcohol taste isn't much present, although one can feel the ABV eventually. Unsurprisingly, the aftertaste is coffee and raisins.",4.5

Beer poured dark brown with an okay tan head.

Nose is quite nice, bourbon, leather, vanilla, and tequila are very pungent.

Taste is superb, a large malt base comprised of five different beers allows the bourbon, vanilla, tequila, and dark fruits to express nicely with the usual amount of hopping still remaining, along with the barrel presence, to balance the finish.

Taste: Caramel and spice cake forward with the barrel blend emerging; even though the Bourbon barrels predominate it is the Brandy barrel which directs the flavor profile; the Tequila arrives in the rear; sticky, sweet and complex finish that is reminiscent of a Dr Pepper

It has a sweet start, but is undercut by spicy whiskey, although in harmony, this works to create a beautiful balance. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty, and earthy malts. Dark fruits, caramel, and molasses develop a smooth sweetness, which is balanced out by late whiskey and barrel. The latter offers up some heavy, strong notes, without being hot. Some sticky, resiny hops sit in between the sugary notes, adding a little bitterness for balance. Mouth feel is thick with a near soft effervescence, carrying just enough silt to keep it from being plush. Instead, this silt works to elevate the texture out of forgettable.

Old Rasputin,"COLOR:

Jet black, with a hefty mocha colored head that's about 2-3 fingers and lingers. This beer is as black as the inside of a coffin on a moonless night.

AROMA:

Smoked malt, molasses, figs, leather, cocoa, brown sugar, with a hint of hops.

Smells quite lovely.

BODY AND PALATE:

Tastes like it smells. Rich smoked malt that comes across as espresso and dark chocolate. A lot of the other notes show up, with a nice hops bitter note that doesn't overpower the rich bittersweetness of this stout.

In terms of mouthfeel, it's heavy mkay? Nice and creamy feeling, which is what I prefer in a stout or a porter.

This one coats the tongue and lingers. It develops oh so well, and lands on a curious whole wheat toast finish, which I guess I'm attributing to the malt, which is interesting and welcome. I love malty aftertastes.

CONCLUSION:

This is the gold standard of imperial stouts. It hits all of the notes, and ticks all of the boxes as to what I expect out of a nice stout. Every stout I try is compared to this, and most, unless they're milk stouts, fail to compare.

Black as sin? Check.

Rich as coffee in flavor? Check.

Thick and full bodied? Check.

Rich and complex without one note overpowering the other? Check.

Easy sipper? Oh HELL YES!!!!

Smacks you in the face with how strong it is? You betcha.

Only issue is the slight bloated feeling I get drinking imperial stouts. They're basically meals in a glass, so if you want a refreshing beer, might wanna look elsewhere. That said, this pairs really well with waffles, surprisingly.

Overall, for me, this is a 10/10 beer. It is my favorite beer of all time, and all stouts I compare to this, which I suppose now is an unfair comparison.",5.0
Old Rasputin,"L: jet black inky body, nice light head. Standard quality stout.

S: roasty, smoky, a hint of salted caramel, and ethyl. Weaker on the nose than I’d like but it’s good.

T: Follows nose. It definitely helps to open it up a bit and let it warm. Reminds me of fall without the spices.

F: a little oily but not much. Coats the tongue a little and has mild carbonation. Not perfect, but rewarding.

O: I can’t wait to revisit this once the weather starts cooling off. A quality benchmark stout to measure all stouts against. Not my favorite stout, but definitely a classic.",4.5
Old Rasputin,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to sit at room temp for 5-10 min, before pouring into round-bottomed stein

Look: dark molasses, with cola highlights. Had to pour in stages, due to the 4-finger thick, dense, dark tan head

Smell: oats, dark chocolate, malts, and dark dried fruits

Taste: intense, dark roast coffee on the front end, with some slight lightening to a bit herbaceousness in the middle. Lingering notes of unsweetened cocoa and coffee. Semi-sweet chocolate notes emerge in the middle as the beer continues to air and warm

Mouthfeel: full at the front, giving way to a syrupy smooth feel in the mouth. Good effervescence on the tongue, preventing it from becoming overwhelmingly heavy.

Overall: hot damn, this is a tantalizing beer. On look and smell alone, it gets near perfect marks. Taste was a tad bit too bitter for my palate, but it still had diverse elements to the bitterness that made it enjoyable. I can see why it's consistently ranked one of the best beers, if not the best stout",4.25

T-a surprisingly unified flavor, in that the aftertaste matches the beginning. Multiple flavors but none predominate and I’m hard pressed to call out, e.g., coffee, chocolate, or dark fruits in particular.

T: so much better than the smell. Loads of dark chocolate and some smoke with a nice hop bitterness. Root beer, cola, and molasses that flows into light notes of peppermint patty.

F: maybe a little thinner than some other stouts that I have had, but I prefer it that way. Coats the front snide of the mouth with a nice creamy feel. Warming",4.5
Old Rasputin,"I'm really surprised by the reviews for this one compared to my own experience. Usually BeerAdvocate doesn't steer me wrong. And this beer isn't ""wrong,"" it's just basic and underwhelming. In short, it takes like a Sam Adams with a touch of dark.

L: Very dark. Opaque black. It's a good start to a stout in that sense, but the pour looked thin to me. Not something I'm used to when serving an imperial stout. The head was a couple inches in height that took 5 minutes to start dissipating, and I can hear it fizzing out with a film of bubbles lining the glass where it once stood.

S: ""Generic beer"". I was hoping for a malty, smoky smell to align with the flavor profiles others described. I held out hope that the taste would contradict my initial experience, but...

T&F: I did a doubletake on the bottle to confirm that I had bought a stout. At this point, I was sure I must've misread the bottle when I purchased it or grabbed the wrong case off of the shelf. It's thin and lacks any unique flavor. It tastes like a dark beer. No ""smoke"" as others describe and no malty thickness I've grown accustomed to in a good, imperial stout. As previously stated, it tastes like any Sam Adams that you could grab.

O: Basic. Unremarkable. Ordinary. Not offensive, but certainly not worth seeking out or even purchasing again. And judging it as a stout, it fails in many of the characteristics you'd expect.",2.75
Old Rasputin,"my 2nd try with this popular stout... before found it a bit too hoppy-malty bitter to my liking. but now... acquiring the taste a bit.

The bottling code begins with the numerals ""11"" so i assume this is the year it was sealed? Pours an opaque raven with a bubbly cocoa head, dissipated to a mist & menacing gauntlet of bubbles on the surface. Fantastic webbing that stays put! Aroma is like a pumpernickel bread with molasses... Taste is slightly sweet, but largely dry and deeply bitter from the hops & roasted malts... something minty overhead that reminds me of a peppermint patty?... Swallow is deep, bittersweet, nice body and not too sticky, coats the tongue.

an RIS most worthy of its reputation.",4.5

Icelandic Toasted Porter,"Canned 09/06/22, 12 ounce.
Poured black with a one-finger beige head. Very nice coffee aroma. It reminds me of driving in the old Folger's area downtown. The taste is coffee toffee, roasted. The taste lingers. There's a dark fruit note, too.
Creamy porter mouthfeel. Finishes smooth, leaving me wanting more.",4.5
Icelandic Toasted Porter,"11.2oz can purchased from the fridge as six pack for $11.99. Canned on 2/22, so this is just over 5 months old.

Look: Pours out a very dark brown color, and looks black in the glass. There is a nice brownish/tan colored frothy head that slowly recedes and leaves nice lacing.

Smell: Nice roasty aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and nuttiness. Has an interesting ashy, charcoaly nose to it that is really intriguing. Notes of fudgy brownies. There is also a subtle creamy vanilla aroma that is very nice. Mild earthy hop aroma on the finish. Very subtle notes of dark fruit on the back end.

Taste: Definitely tastes like a Baltic porter. Up front, there is a bit of sweetness before the dryness takes over. The finish is very dry, slightly acidic, and has that nice charcoal drying effect from the toasted malt. Lingering hop bitterness on the finish, reminds me a bit of a Russian Imperial Stout with more roast and less body. Lingering licorice and bitter chocolate and coffee flavors also.

Feel: This beer is on the low side of medium body, I would say 2/3 to 3/4 towards medium body. It holds its own for 6% ABV.

Overall: This is probably one of the hoppier Baltic porters that I have had. It seems to me that the European Baltic Porters are brewed in a generally more hoppy vein than the way that an American brewer would tend to make a Baltic porter. It has a coffee-forward flavor profile and it is a bit thin; that being said, it's quite drinkable and I certainly wouldn't mind having this instead of a cup of coffee in the morning!",3.75
Icelandic Toasted Porter,"330ml can. Can bottomed is stamped '06.10.21 BF 06/DEC/2022'.

Less than medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.
Smooth and crisp baltic porter, with emphasis on the dark roasted malts.",3.75
Icelandic Toasted Porter,"Poured from a 330mL can, canned on June 22 2021, best before Aug 22 2022

On the pour a 2 finger brown head forms then over 5 or so minutes it dissipates to a thick ring around the glass. The body let's barely any light through and any light that does come through is a dark muted red.

Aroma is all roasted malt and coffee. Some dark chocolatey vibes. Some sweet dark fruit vibes. Definitely a porter, the Baltic part of the Baltic porter isn't as obvious in the aroma as I'd like (this is a lager not an ale). Very sweet and roasty.

Flavor follows the smell with a big wave of roast and bitterness coming from the roasted malts as well. Much less sweetness on the taste basically all roasty bitter malty flavors with black coffee as the finish. The Baltic side of this porter is actually detectable with a smooth/crisp finish focusing largely on the malt.

Feel is big but with a crispness that comes as the beer finishes making it easy to put down and giving it a light finish for the color and flavor. Leaves you wanting another sip. Quite a carbonation bite on this, almost refreshing but the dark flavors and abv keep it just below that threshold.

Overall a pretty fun dark beer with a big focus on malts and roasty flavors without being as dry and chocolatey as a stout. Dark to the point of being burnt tasting however woth the dark coffee beans. The most impressive part of this beer is how drinkable it is for a porter.",3.75
Icelandic Toasted Porter,"Best by 1/26/23

“Toasted Porter” seems like an odd phrase to me. Don’t all Porters use some degree of malt that’s been toasted? Either way, it sounds good right about now, so let’s get into it

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Well it definitely does smell “extra toasted” which is appreciated. I’m picking up on aromas of milk chocolate, toasted hazelnut, acidic coffee, toffee, sweet vanilla, earthy hops, and light raisin

It’s a bit nondescript in taste, especially up front, but it’s still enjoyable. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting roasted coffee, sweet vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, brown sugar, raisin, herbal hops, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry and balanced

This is pretty good. Nothing amazing but damn solid for what it is",3.75

Icelandic Toasted Porter,"Dated Sept 14, 21. Drinking on Feb 21, 22 at fridge temperature.

L: jet black body with no light protruding through. Off white finger head that turns to a ring. Moderate lacing.

S: toasted malts, chocolate, smells well past due.

T: nice roasted malts, dark chocolate, rich coffee. I bet this would be an excellent porter if fresh. Instead this one has hints of the intended flavors but the unmistakable musky taste of an outdated brew. Oh well maybe next time.

F: creamy with slightly too high carbonation. Medium full bodied but very smooth.

O: this particular 6er was disappointing but I’m eager to try the brew again fresh. The look and feel are on point, and the roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate were rich and complemented each other well. Just too much skunk to comfortably enjoy this time.",4.0
Icelandic Toasted Porter,"Ever so slight scent of toasted hops once the top is popped. The two-finger café latte head is slow to form, but persists for a while above the opaque dark chocolate-colored brew. In the glass, more toast and smoke and coffee become noticeable. Starts off with a round, slightly sweet creaminess that dissipates to a decidedly citrus and astringent finish. Maybe this is an off-can, but I really don't detect chocolate, coffee, much roastiness or toastiness or smoothness. This is not the porter I was looking for, and will not be looking for again.",2.75
Icelandic Toasted Porter,"Look: Jet black pour with heavy foam (3 fingers length risen to the surface). Not much lacing as this dissolves.
Smell: Getting notes of coffee, caramel, dark chocolate. Not used to porters as much since I'm mainly a stout drinker but it has a smell that resembles a few porters I've had in the past.
Taste: Big notes of roastyness and bitterness. Getting big notes of coffee in the end. Not to sweet. Very smooth going down. Maybe it's the type of water used to craft this beer. Amazing!!!!
Feel: medium bodied, not to heavy but slight heaviness on initial taste then softens immediately as it flourishes in you're mouth. For some reason it makes you want to have another drink.
Overall: I wasn't expecting to like a porter since I'm a sweet/dessert friendly stout fan but I found myself buying this a second time vs trying beers and tossing them aside. I'll definitely buy this in the future but this is a great beer to have with a meal/ hanging with friends or even sipping by yourself finishing up work or finding yourself to relax at the end of the day.

Icelandic Toasted Porter,"Solid Baltic porter from our friends in Iceland. 6% ABV makes it an approachable choice for those seeking a porter fix.

Poured from a 12 ounce can, the body was a pleasant dark brown. Minor head with insignificant lacing.

Toasted malts are up front in aroma and taste as expected. Notes of chocolate make this porter a pleasant drink. Mouthfeel was intentionally made on the light side due to their use of lager yeast and left me wishing that had been boosted. Hard to argue with their intentions, but my personal preference is for a bit more heft in my porters like in GLBC Edmund Fitzgerald or Founders Porter.

Samuel Adams Wicked Hazy,"seems like a beer just to say they have a hazy in their portfolio, since you know, everyone else is doing it. it lacks the sort of historical richness or nod to tradition that many of their beers have, and its not innovative enough to have its okay quality be permissible, its samey, sweeter than it needs to be, and something that seems more like checking a box than a product of any real inspiration. that said, plenty of breweries put a lot more thought and effort into their hazy stuff and its way worse than this, the one thing the big breweries most of the time can guarantee is that its not going to be garbage, but not bad is also not good, and thats the case here, i just want way more from this. i get some generic citrus and canned pineapple in the aroma and flavor, which are pretty much the same, could be mosaic forward, but there is enough residual sweetness in here to be distracting from the hops, juicy sure, but the sugars make almost candied, its too much, and this would improve a lot with some further drying out. sweet orange slices, orange and lemon taffy, and a little white wheat come together in the taste, clean on the ferment in terms of yeast character, but i wish it was allowed to work on this a bit longer. i appreciate the high carbonation in the style, but its not enough to save this as drinkable, even though it adds some needed life. perhaps intended as somewhat of an introductory hazy, no massive dry hopping or experimental varietals here, but also no greenness, overdosed hop bite, or sloppy levels of sediment, its more refined than many, probably fairly consistent for the style, and enjoyable without being challenging to anyone. didnt do a ton for me, especially in the context of some other fine hazy beers in the same session, but its predictably decent.",3.5

Warsteiner Brewers Gold,"Deeply, perversely curious as to how a brewery as old and established as fucking Warsteiner rolls out a new product to appease us American pigs.

I associate the phrase ""Brewer's Gold"" with Brewer's Gold hops, which were once probably genuinely used in Ballantine Ale and then became a weird trademark that had absolutely nothing to do with the Ballantine that was on the market by the time I was alive. Accordingly, my idiot brain expected this to be Ballantine-colored. Friends, it was not. It is instead the color of a very nice bock, and even then that blows my mind expectation-wise because this is listed as Zwickel, which I always thought was like pilsenser-colored but cloudy. You learn something every day.

Aroma is great, but light. Smells like an excellent American marzen. Like Staghorn, or pre-takeover Millstream Oktoberfest. only a bit dim. Nutty, rounded.

Tastes quite good. Malt-heavy, and unapologetically so. Toasted bread up front, getting sweeter in the middle, caramel and a bit of honey, drying up near the end but never quit letting the hops shines through because they don't need to. Tastes fortifying. This is the sort of beer that people in the 1800's would have thought was health food.",4.25

Flavor: Strong earthy flavors of German bread. Rich brown bread loaf. A strong honey and caramel malt flavor in the middle. A malty finish with a lingering earthiness and toasted malt flavor underneath. Finishes malty and leans sweet from the rich honey.

Feel: Heavier-bodied. Moderate carbonation to balance

Compared to Weihenstephaner 1516 8/13/22: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More rich bread, honey. Less delicate lemon and dry grains. Larger bodied, darker, sweeter.

Compared to Summit Twin Pils 8/13/22: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More malty rich bread, honey. Less lemongrass and dry grains and yeast. Larger bodied, darker, sweeter.

Hazy copper with over an inch of creamy off-white foam. Nose is malty, caramel, bread grains and a bit of toast. Tasting much the same with some spicy hop flavor coming on the back. Low bitterness, full malt but lowly sweet. Medium body, soft mild creamy feel to open then crisping to the finish.

A pleasure to drink and leaves me wanting another. Missing the “zing” that usually comes with fresh local examples of this style but that’s to be expected. Seems as though this could be an unfiltered immature version of their Marzen.",4.25

Notes via stream of consciousness: After having a few of the softer, less bitter beers from southern Germany I need a little more bitterness and I think this beer from Warsteiner which is in northern Germany will do the trick. It's poured a hazy (it's unfiltered) deep copper colored body beneath a short head of creamy off-white foam. The aroma is surprisingly malty with toasted bread and some caramel. The taste follows suit adding in a touch of honey and a delicate background of dark skinned fruits and subtle spice. A moderate bitterness balances it, and I guess I was way wrong on this one because it's more malty than bitter. Still, it finishes mostly dry as the majority of the malt fades quickly but it does linger with golden and medium-red caramel and a touch of honey and dark fruit. In the mouth it's medium leaning towards medium-full in body and creamy smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. I was really wrong about this one because it's so different than their other beers and I wonder how it's selling in Germany. I saw plenty of advertising for it in October of 2021 but I never found it anywhere. My guess is that it will end up selling better outside of Germany. Anyway, it's a great beer in my opinion and I'm going to keep it on my radar.

Warsteiner Brewers Gold,"Nice copper color. Nose is cereal grains, malty, caramel. Taste almost follows exactly. I also get some nuttiness, toffy, and toasted malt. It's OK for what it is. I wish they came in 12 ounce cans instead of the 11.2 ounces.",3.5
Warsteiner Brewers Gold,"Very pretty hazy copper amber with two fingers of sudsy tan head that fade fast and leave almost zero lacing. The aroma is quite muted - faint caramel and citrus for sure; anything else is too faint to tell whether I'm imagining it or not. The flavour is surprisingly muted for a Kellerbier. Can't taste any yeast esters. I get caramel malt, citrus hops, a nice smooth finish with a bit of flavour, and that's about it. The pretty appearance and the smooth and balanced mouthfeel are all this one has going for it. Compared to the Hacker-Pschorr Kellerbier, this is a bland and boring disappointment. However, taken purely as a lager, it's drinkable and there's nothing nasty about it. Just don't bother going out of your way to try this.",3.25

Weihenstephaner 1516 Kellerbier,"Notes from 5/26/2020.
Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass.
The body is hazy yellow orange with 2 fingers of white head. Retention is somewhat below average leaving an island of very thin foam.
The intensity of aroma is very low. There are notes of malt, yeast, and a little sweetness.
The intensity of taste is medium. The flavor has sweet malt, wheat bread, a hint of chocolate covered malt candy, and a long low hop bitter finish. There's a lot of subtle complexity to the taste that I cannot parse.
The thickness is a little below medium. It's slightly creamy, has a carbonation level just below medium, and a low amount of astringency.
Overall, I really appreciate the subtle complexity of this beer. It's not the same, but some of the flavor reminds me of Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale. I wish I had bought more than a single bottle.",4.0
Weihenstephaner 1516 Kellerbier,"1.5 x 0.33 L bottles
Bottle Date: 5109 => 08 March, 2019
Glass: 0.5L Fest Mug


Look:
Cloudy/murky/opaque dark gold. When I hold the glass to a light, I can see the shadow of my hand thru the beer but no individual fingers. Otherwise, nothing can be seen thru the beer. 2-finger white head dissipates to a very thin but complete cover. The lacing along the glass is OK.

Smell:
Crackers, biscuits, bread dough, and grains. Light grassy hops. Vague hint of lemon.

Taste:
Follows the nose, but with the grassy hops a bit more prevalent (though nowhere near dominant). The lemon/citrus note is also more pronounced than the in nose. The beer dries very slightly at the end to go with a low-key tart note that makes one want another sip.

Feel:
Smooth and creamy. Body is medium-full (due to the suspended yeast, no doubt)

Overall:
A superb Kellerbier that has excellent drinkability. My favorite of the style. I was quite happy when Weihenstephan decided to make this special brew (made to pay homage to the 500th anniversary of the Rheinheitsgebot in 2016) a regular offering.

The bottles that I am having right now are over 3 years old, so the hops have died down quite a bit but the beer still holds a great balance. When fresh (especially vom Fass) the hops are very noticeable and add a spiciness to the beer, as other reviews attest.

One thing to note - being a Kellerbier, the beer is unfiltered, and if you want the yeast to be in suspension you should pour the beer similar to a Hefeweizen, and swirl the very last inch or so of liquid before pouring it.",4.0
Weihenstephaner 1516 Kellerbier,"Appearance: Pours a mostly clear (>90% clarity), medium orange to golden color with a moderate and pleasant white head. SRM of 9-10. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong and bready aromas upfront. A wave of bread before it turns into a honey and grain sweetness. Some light yeast that gives hints of lemon and honey.

Flavor; Moderate flavors of smooth bread malts that evolve into a honey flavor before some drying yeast and grains. Yet ultimately it finishes slightly sweet and smooth with a light lemon and honey on the finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate, but lower carbonation for the style. A honey sweetness lingers on the palate.

Compared to Summit Keller Pils 4/17/22: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More bread malt, sweet lemon, and honey. Less flower and dry grains. Larger and sweeter.

Compared to Paulaner Helles 6/6/22: Pours a darker color, milder aromas. More bready malts and yeast. Less earthy honey and smooth. A more full and bready mouthfeel.

Compared to Boulevard Bob '47 Lager 6/6/22: Pours a lighter color, milder head. Milder aromas. More pale malt and bread. Less amber and toasty malts. Much cleaner, and less rich malts.

Compared to Warsteiner Brewer's Gold 8/13/22: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. More lemon and dry grains. Less caramel, rich bread, honey. Lighter and cleaner.

Compared to Summit Twin Pils 8/13/22: Pours a darker color. Milder aromas. More earthy grains. Less lemon and dry grains. Decently similar.

Overall: A pretty good German lager here. Pours clearer and drinks heavier and sweeter than I expected for the style. Nice bread malts and honey flavors. Smooth and rich. A great beer, rich bread, yeast, and smooth. (Rating: 4.03+)

White bread wafts upwards with light floral yeast. Faint, sweet honey follows. After modest warmth, light graham crackers are revealed.

It is more bitter than I had initially expected, however, as a Kellerbier, this should have been understood from the label. Water crackers are very pronounced, with faint pepper and faint toasted grains throughout. The finish is long and mild.

A medium body with a coarse, cotton texture. A hint of alcohol is about as expected, while the carbonation is light and fine.

Weihenstephaner 1516 Kellerbier,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heavy of a carmal aroma mixed with some bready smells and a little bit of harvest fruit. Along with these aromas comes a touch of graininess and a little bit of earth as well.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweet caramel and light bready taste mixed with flavors of light harvest fruit. These tastes create a base flavor for the brew, lasting throughout the flavor profile. As the taste advances from the initial flavors detected on the tongue, some grain and wheat tastes join into the flavor profile as well, and with a touch of earthiness one is left with a very pleasant bready, and lightly sweet but enjoyable taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light and crisp with a carbonation level that is rather high. For the style the feel is great and makes for a nice easy drinker.
Overall – A rather nice lager with a good flavor and great drinkability.",4.0
Weihenstephaner 1516 Kellerbier,"Bottled 12/8/20

It’s always nice to try a beer from Weihenstephan. As far as classic German styles go they are absolutely my go-to. Kellerbier is pretty obscure these days so I’m always happy to try the ones that I can find, which has only been 5 so far including this one. Let’s crack this open

Pours a murky orange with a finger of creamy white head that fades to a quickly thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This is wonderfully balanced in the nose, the crisp malt mixing with yeasty notes. I’m picking up aromas of bready malt, pear, white pepper, orange zest, grassy hops, honey, and toasted grain

While it was evenly balanced in aroma, the taste brings out more fruitiness, but it works in this beer. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting doughy malt, golden raisin, pear, white pepper, toasted grain, and a touch of caramel. The swallow brings notes of rich honey, golden raisin, lemon rind, toasted grain, doughy malt, herbal hops, and pear

A light medium body pairs with airy carbonation, resulting in a beer somewhere between crisp and creamy. Finishes slightly sticky with a light bitterness for balance

This is one hell of a Keller. I could throw back many without much thought. I’d love to find it a bit fresher next time but oh well",4.25
Weihenstephaner 1516 Kellerbier,"I love this style and this is one of the best I've had. Maybe the best. Lightly cloudy gold, lots of lace. Malty nose has a complex blend of noble hops.

Some yeast notes on the nose and palate, along with some nice green apple and lemon aromas, I assume from the Hallertauer Record hops. Surprisingly, is not particularly malty.

Weihenstephaner 1516 Kellerbier,"L: Pretty sure if I type in ""Kellerbier"" it'll pop right up *clack clack* you better believe it. This isn't amateur hour. I gave it a rather mean pour and it reacted well--Which is to be expected, sometimes the brewer will let off carbonation to make it smoother and less filling. It's not a dull color, more hazy, it's a nice take but not final.

S: Has a familiar German resonance about it. I'm not surprised the label says Weihenstephaner. It's a buttery biscuit absolutely. It's creamy and smooth, I'm not concerned about what's about to happen next, the nose has me at ease.

T: This is a paved path. It's meant to be around. There is a remarkable absence of impurity. The flavor is subtle. There is no particular thing jumping out at me, but there is a nice blend of things occurring. It has a smooth, buttery, woodiness to it. This is München specialty. Meaning, in Bavaria, the ingredients are limited--So do the most with what you have--A lovely floral, a grainy bouquet opens up on the nose, roasted to perfection, balanced all the way through.

F: It's light on the palate, the hop bitterness is appreciated on side palate, and the back of the palate finishes dry thank you. It's interesting, lovely

O: There's no hills or valleys, it's a straight line of lovely. Simple, straightforward, keep ahold of this if you need a brew.. Balanced all the way through. Quite simply, nose, palate, finish, lovely all the way through, straight across, you won't be left wanting. Well, I want another one, but...

Good Gourd,"Canned on 8-1-22. 12oz can poured into a tulip.

Pours a glowing auburn with some haze; fluffy light khaki head that falls leaving solid retention and lacing.

The aromas have some interesting Belgian characteristics leading the way. Some banana and bubblegum coming through which I wasn't expecting. Some caramel. Some veggies. Not much pumpkin spice going on. Malts are there.

The flavors are pretty unique and bolder than the nose. Some cinnamon sugar coming through. More banana and bubblegum. More caramel along with some hints of cocoa. Some sweet potatoes. There's a pretty solid earthiness and bitterness to this one. Decent sweetness. Solid malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is ultimately well hidden.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's thick, fluffy, creamy, and slightly sharp.

Good Gourd,"DATE: November 8, 2020... OCCASION: wrapping up a great four-day weekend with a beer I have hoped to taste for a while now--great to see Cigar City here up in Jersey... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... a foreboding, brownish purple body that shows lively bubbles swelling into an uneven haze of off-white head--this pumpkin looks like it has more of a Halloween attitude than one of Thanksgiving... rich punch of cinnamon, nutmeg, sharp brown sugar, candied clove and all spice evoke a dessert-like aroma.... not much in the way of maltiness suggested by its aroma... first sip is rich, creamy, buzzing at the teeth and the throat, with a boozy finish that lingers warmly... in fact, it stays so long between sips, it seems like one long drink, commanding with a whiskey's confidence but drawing without heat or penalty.... what a beautiful experience this is--the cinnamon and nutmeg explode atop a brown ale's malty base, with clove and light citrus also in the mix... in fact, the late citrus makes this almost read as a whiskey with bitters... big, bold but accessible, I will look for this again next year, and appreciate having CC in Northeastern distribution--this works quite well as a holiday dessertif or a nightcap....",4.25

They're all there, though: cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice and cumin (I kid). Tastes quite delightful, if mildly boozy. I mean, this is a hacky thing to say, but it's pumpkin pie in liquid form. I taste some vanilla, too. Don't know if that's listed as an ingredient, but it's definitely there on the tongue. The spices kind of linger a bit; perhaps too long. Your mileage will certainly vary. Pretty well full-bodied with a dry finish. I'm less crazy about this style with every passing year, but I like this one quite a bit.",3.75

Good Gourd,"Canned on 7/13/20

Pours a deep maroon-mahogany body with just a touch of clarity and topped with a finger of rocky, semi-creamy foam; great head retention recedes slowly to some spotty islands of cap, a firm, creamy ring of collar, and a comprehensive, webbed array of lacing clinging across the glass.

Aroma features a quieted, raw boozy aspect introducing more subdued seasonal notes; soft pie spice, fleeting sense of roasted cloves, squash, allspice, and vanilla for a thinly veiled sweeter quality; light tones of pumpkin comes in waves, balanced by brown sugar into the close.

Taste opens a touch bready, with hints of caramel reinforcing a light malt profile as notes of squash/pumpkin chunks and brown sugar become increasingly prominent over the mid-palate, while nutmeg and cinnamon fade with a boozy finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with an expansive, rounded carbonation trending slick across the mid-palate and with a crispness that tingles into the back end; a smooth yet weighty finish highlights a minor pang of booziness and distant vegetal acridity that had been advancing across the palate, though in pleasant synchronicity with the beer's softer elements.

There's extensive balance beneath the subdued profile and overarching booziness, but not quite prominent enough to see this one through; a roller coaster of a pumpkin ale, with heavy promise but a contrastingly weaker execution leaving a drinkable though unimpressive final impression.",3.5

Good Gourd,"Ths is a super pumpkin ale I sampled first last night with my brother outside on my parent's porch until the wee hours. Obviously the beer was delicious,as my brother had promised it would be. I am rewinding tonight with the one surviving beer.

For me, the spices hit more or less perfectly, the cinammon and nutmeg staying on your tongue well into theftertaste. The rest is incredibly complimentiary, understated, and balanced. The bright, satisfying maltiness is only elevated by the pumpkin flavors. This doesn't mash you on the head with heavy sweetness and become riddled with booze flavors like some of the better, more ""traditional"" pumpkins. Hard to believe its packing so much alcohol. Just outstanding.",4.5
Good Gourd,"Upon pouring, my first thought is, this beer is perfectly coordinated with the can as if they were wearing matching outfits. The tan head with etchings of tawny mimics the top of the can. The liquid itself, however, is more cinnamon/copper than anything close to a vibrant orange. I'd call it syrupy looking maintaining a certain seasonality.

What makes one pumpkin pie better than the others? Crust, spice mix, sweeteners, binding agents, quality of pumpkin. First thought on aroma, this doesn't remind me of a pie. More like a pumpkin cake (your typical muffin nowadays) with a brown sugar/butter/cinnamon streusel top. More like a pumpkin crumb cake I'd have with a cup of coffee in the morning.

Will the taste depart from the brown sugar/cinnamon? Somewhat. Brown sugar is the main sweet element. Pumpkin is there, and helped by a hopping with subtle notes of citrus, black pepper and nutmeg. Tastes a little like raw pumpkin smells...a bit bitter. Coffee grounds, clementine, lavender. If that doesn't sell you...it ends up tasting down a like a slightly watered down Captain Morgan Black with a dollop of pumpkin cream; so, really outstanding in terms of a pumpkin beer.

Medium body with a little chewiness in the middle. Rather dense impression followed swiftly by tart elderberry.",4.5
Good Gourd,"Excited to try this highly rated beer. Deep copper see through color to this brew with a good sized tan head. Head fading quickly but a nice look none the less. Initial nose is sweet with some pumpkin and related spices. A further scent of the can really brings out a rich deep nose. Ok, really like the balance and smoothness of this brew. The evenness allows the spices to take center stage before the bite pulls it away with a drying finish. This slightly vanilla sweet yet bitter brew has a medium body and enough carbonation to keep me happy. I’ve got to admit, this stuff is pretty good here.",4.25

So, knowing Cigar Citys' reputation, I bought a case of Good Gourd, without even tasting it. This beer met my expectations.. a great purchase! It pours a gourgeous, dark copper, with a bit more head than your average pumpkin. The carbonation level was ample.. the taste, wonderful. The tyical autumn spices are all there, and they are proportioned superbly. They create a slightly bitter presence, which is nicely offset by a noticeable vanilla sweetness, which forms a distinctly sweet caramel note.

La Fin Du Monde,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep and rich orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 10. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong and complex aromas of orange citrus, bread, bananas, and Belgian spices. A candied sweetness underneath.

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread notes, a sweet yeast that leaves flavors of citrus, grapes, banana, and Belgian spices of clove and coriander. A light astringency. Then a sweet and bready finish.

Feel: A heavier-body. Strong carbonation and yeast. A soft, full mouthfeel. Surprisingly clean for the sweet body. (4.25+)

Overall: A top-of-the-line Tripel here. I haven't had a good one in a while. This one reminded me what I was missing. Authentic. Nails the aromas and flavors. A nice balance of citrus, banana, and bread spice. A full, soft, yet clean mouthfeel. All aspects are top tier here. (Rating: 4.30)",4.5

La Fin Du Monde,"L: Hazy, glowing golden body with a dense, even head.
S: Soft and sweet. Cracker, pear, honey, apricot, and faint spices.
T: Less soft. A burst of citrus, then floral hops; apricot, yeast, sweet in the body, hints of spice, and bready, woody notes on the finish.
F: High carbonation, with a very dry finish.
O: It’s a great beer, but the best tripel out there? I suspect there are better.",4.25

La Fin Du Monde,"Best before 5/28/2024 - consumed on 3/27/2022. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Unibroue tulip.

Lightly cloudy sunglow body supports a lasting finger of baby powder crema. Fine, dense lacing; no legs; superior retention.

Sweet gentle aromatics suggest honey, ripe pear, and hints of spice (cinnamon/coriander/clove/white pepper?). A touch of banana as well.

Palate entry follows the nose, but is followed by a hefty malt note, more phenols/spice, and a low but lingering bitterness. Earthy/grassy/not-quite-floral hop flavors emerge once in a while. House yeast character is present, but by no means dominant. Medium finish with a hint of curaçao (orange), overripe banana, and alcohol.

Medium-bodied, well carbonated, and fairly warming.

While lacking the complexity of the better Belgian examples, this remains one of the best domestic/North American renditions available.",4.25
La Fin Du Monde,"Hits all the marks for a tripel. Flavor profile seems a touch on the bold side, perhaps to suit the North American palate.",4.0
La Fin Du Monde,"Sampling a cellar temp 750 ml bottle that I picked up at the store 2 weeks ago. Date stamp of best before 04-19-2024 on this corked and caged bottle.
Pouring into my snifter, the beer is a bright gold color, almost champagne like out of the glass. A creamy bleached white head foams up 2 cm and rests as a sturdy surface layer that remains through the tasting. I also have dense clingy lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Several very fine streams of carbonation rise to the surface of the glass.
The aroma is some biscuity malt, a little bit of fruit note with pears and green apple and some white grape. I also get a little lemon and maybe some coriander. No real booziness giveaway.
First sip reveals a medium body with a bit of crisp texture and fine tingly and fizzy carbonation. The bubbles foam up in my mouth with no swirl. Definitely a little prickly carbonation.
Flavor is some sweet fruit with pears and white grape moving to cloves and coriander and then a little black pepper the bites on the finish. No warming booze, but the bite seems to be abv related. Finish is very dry and encourages me to take another sip.
the flavors on this beer are bolder than some other recent tripels and I enjoy the combination of tastes. Quite a solid beer that will sneak up on you with well hidden booze.",4.5
La Fin Du Monde,"Poured from 12oz bottle

The look is highly carbonated with a dark golden lightly hazy body. 2 finger head on the pour larger bubbles, shrinks down to a one finger head of fine bubbles. After sitting for a bit carbonation is still quite lively. Some lacing.

The aroma iels essentially all belgian yeast with a light crackery malt on the back end. Slight funk sort of makes me think of an older bottle of an AAL, the funk however fits this style much better than a lager, but still throwing me off a little bit. Some fruity esters also detectable.

The flavor is quite similar to the smell, some light citrus notes followed by banana esters and some hints of clove. Perhaps some of what I'm picking up is the spice it was brewed with as the bottle says. I'm not sure what the spice is. After the ferment character once again some crackery malt shines through. The malt is also sweet and present on the first sip before being overwhelmed by yeast character.

Feel is dominated by the big carbonation. The head doesn't make this one creamy so much as carbonation bite dominates. Despite that the beer is not at all watery and sticks around on the palate for a while.

Overall a good belgian style trippel. I wasn't actually aware it was Canadian however until looking on BA here which docks the score a bit, but the beer itself is a good take on a trippel.",3.75
La Fin Du Monde,"A lively carbonated, highly quaffable trippel. This is one I always revisit over the years. Less sweet than most, but still full of those fruity esters, a beautiful floral bouquet awash with lingering spices. Tons of rich flavors are enlivened by the effervescence, more of a gulper than a smooth sipper. I could drink more of these in one sitting than I should",4.75
La Fin Du Monde,"Pours a hazy, light orange-yellow with a nice thick two inch head, that slowly recedes into one inch of a thick bubbly ring. Lighter than I expected — or maybe the Belgian Tripels I’ve had so far are just darker than usual.

Spices, cloves, and stone fruit. The aroma is more spice and fruit forward than malty or yeasty, so if that’s your thing for Tripels, you are going to love this. Oh, definite coriander on the nose as well.

The flavours are somewhat mild for the style but pretty complex. It follows the aromas pretty tightly, but I get a little more malt and wheaty bread like notes here, to be expected. Nothing like Rochefurt Tripel or some other Tripels, but still a pleasant malt backbone. Which makes it finish relatively sweet, but more peppery than you might expect. Some nutmeg and caramel here as well. As always for this style, recommended to not serve ice cold, or to sip slowly and let it warm up and enjoy the evolution of flavours. The finish noticeably lengthens as it warms, and the malty notes in the back are strengthened as it decants. Some candied pear flavours come out here as well that I didn’t notice when it was cold!

Surprisingly light bodied, there is strong carbonation that foams with each sip, which brings out that peppery feel for sure. You will not taste the alcohol whatsoever. Finishes dry and sweet, and unlike a few other reviewers, I did not notice much acidity or bitterness whatsoever.

Due to the lack of ability to import, and LCBO restrictions, Ontario is not the best for international beers. But the one best thing about living here is access to Unibroue. All their beers are great and you can always get them fresh. My bottle was only a few weeks old.

Overall, compared to some of the Belgian Tripels, you might notice it’s a bit less sweet and more balanced in flavours. The malt and yeasty notes are there, but fairly mild. The fruity esters and spicy notes are more of a feature here. If this is your style for Tripels, I can see why this is ranked at the top. If you like serious malt, yeast, sweetness, some of the Trappist beers from Belgium dial it up more. This is still an absolute top tier offering and an absolute must-try for anyone who likes Belgian beers or tripels no matter how you prefer the style.",4.25

La Fin Du Monde,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $6.00. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Pours a dark & hazy goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head. Lacing is excellent; great legs.
S - Coriander, stone fruit, yeasty breads. Lemongrass, and nutmeg. A bit of white grape, as well.
T - Taste follows nose. Also getting a bit of raw sugarcane, clove, and citron. Finish is surprisingly dry, and peppery. Fairly sweet until the finish, but well-balanced flavor-wise.
F - Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and scarily easy-to-drink - I didn't even realize it was 9% ABV until halfway through the glass and I looked closer at the bottle!
O - Easily one of the best beers I've had; a must-try for everyone. From the color to the flavor, this brew sets the bar for non-Trappist tripels. Spicy, complex, and extremely satisfying. A bit on the sweet side, but the flavor complexity makes up for it. I do intend to purchase this one again, and would highly encourage one to buy it if they see it - even if the price seems a little high for a 12oz bottle.",4.75
La Fin Du Monde,"Nose: citrus fruits, apricots, mild grape, minor malt and alcohol smell. Easily one of the most appetizing beers I have experienced.

In the Glass: Beautiful medium/ dark amber. Pour with a good head as a Tripel should be enjoyed.

Palate: beautiful rich aromas become sweet and complex, FULL bodied, for a 9% alcohol Tripel there is no bite or harshness to La Fin Du Monde. I cannot stress the how full of citrus and sweet fruit this beer is, it is unbelievable that a beer could be this complex. Sweetness mixes well with the malt body. What a great experience

Finish: In the throat the sweetness leaves and moves into a smooth and somewhat more sharp finish. Once again I would never have guessed this is a 9% abv ale.

While this Tripel is extremely pricy in Ontario Canada, I urge all those who are into beers whether it be Belgian ales, wheat beers or IPAs, this is truly a great experience.
This is the only beer or beverage (I review a lot of single malt scotch whiskies) I would give a perfect rating.",5.0

Alien Church,"It shouldn't get much better than this. A clear pint glass filled from the tap, right here in Ardmore, in the brew house. At happy hour, no less, so it's half priced. The brew is a dense straw-amber with a modest white head. It brings a great piney aroma, backed with a little malt. This is one exceptional beer, not too far off of what you'd expect from one of the great Vermont brewers. The hop inclusion is piney and although it bitters during the finish, it never gets close to being astringent. It also manages to do this without getting resinously sticky. The malt body and balance are superb. Truly one of the smoothest, yet full tasting NEIPAs you'll ever have. Everything about this beer works, including some nice glass lacing. Ridiculously drinkable, with a legitimate ABV, this is world class, for sure.",4.75
Alien Church,"BOW DOWN
2/22/22

Or so is stamped the bottom of the can. Pours that banana taffy hazy yellow that I don't particularly care for, but the two fingers of head are quite the sight. So there's that at least. It eventually thins out to a frothy cap that never fully vanishes. Smells hoppy and juicy and, yes, I can see you barking ""no shit"" at your screen. So, to be more specific, I'm picking up mango and just green, nostril singing hop. That dreaded onion-y note I often find in NEIPAs is buried in there, but they're masking it really well. Ultimately smells decent enough. A little hop burn on the tongue, with a little onion as well, but there's enough pine and citrus and other assorted fruit-y notes to distract you. Finishes with a lingering citrus bitterness. Drinks awful smooth, though, with a pillowy-soft mouthfeel. I don't know; this hasn't exactly changed my mind on the style as a whole, but it's certainly better than most NEIPAs I've tried.",4.0

Alien Church,"Poured from a 16-oz can into pint glass in October 2021. There was a brewed date on the label of 10/18/2021. I bought this at the brewpub and drank this less about 1 week after purchase.

Appearance: Medium gold color with huge white head. It is a bright and has a very hazy complexion, like other New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute time, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: The aroma filled the room while the beer was being poured. Strong aroma of citrus, pine, and hops, as well as some sweetness like pineapple. Also, a little earthy or straw aroma. Overall, the citrus aroma dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Sweet taste with a strong bitter hops edge. There is also a nice malt sweetness as well, and also some berry flavors. There is a typical hops and citrus flavor, but with some sweetness as well. This is bitter like most other New England IPAs, but it is very well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a long time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium-Strong bodied, which makes this very drinkable. Medium-Strong alcohol, which matches the 7.0% listed.

This is a very good and interesting IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, grapefruit, hops, malt, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. I like the overall balance, and that the citrus flavors are pronounced but do not dominate the flavor. It has more of a hop edge than many other IPAs. This would be a good IPA to drink often.

Alien Church is one of my favorite IPAs along with the Dogfish 90 Minute and 120 Minute IPAs, Victory's DirtWolf, Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum, and Troeg's Perpetual IPA. This is in my top 5 for IPAs, and I will definitely buy this again.",4.5

Bone in the Throat,"Canned on 8/31/22; consumed on 9/22/22

Pours a turbid, dark sunflower-gold body capped with three fingers of fluffy, white foam; solid head retention yields a paper-thin cap, creamy, moderately-sized collar, and a generous, haphazard array of webby/spotty lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.

Aroma bursts with sticky guava resins upfront, soon giving way to contrasts of dead grass and almost waxy moss undertones; orange peel meets grapefruit over the middle, while tinges of bubblegum embrace a wheaty weight on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste opens to grapefruit and guava, with fresh wheat intertwined with wet moss and grass over the mid-palate as fruity resins and musty pineapple resume a sweeter prominence on the back end of the profile.

Mouthfeel delivers a medium-full body and a fluffy spritz of fuller carbonation, producing a dry prickle and wispy grit over the mid-palate and leaving juicy resins oncoming through the back end, where a creaminess peaks through the finish and a vague, hoppy twang lingers.

A full, weighty profile laden in resins and uncompromisingly deft on the tongue; another prime sampling of the effortless contrasts in flavor and texture Root + Branch pulls from their NEIPAs.",4.0
